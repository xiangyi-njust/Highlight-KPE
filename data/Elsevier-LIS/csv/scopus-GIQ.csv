Governments seek to employ disruptive technologies to substantially transform government-citizen relationships, enhance citizens’ experiences, transform public decision making, emphasize citizen engagement in the democratic decision-making process, provide more agile and resilient government structures, create substantial public value and generally improve quality of life. Despite its numerous potential advantages, smart government is still in its early phases of development. Examining issues related to the usage behavior of smart government services has received little attention. Outcomes of the usage of online technologies in general, and electronic public services in particular, have been largely overlooked. Accordingly, this study aims at developing and empirically validating an integrated model of smart government usage by extending the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) through the incorporation of a set of determinants and outcomes of smart government usage following an extensive review of extant literature. The data were obtained from 414 smart government clients in the United Arab Emirates through an online questionnaire and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results of this study indicated that, among all significant antecedents of smart government usage, performance expectancy has the strongest impact, whilst facilitating conditions has the weakest influence. It has been also reported that personalization has no significant effect on smart government usage. The results further revealed that the strongest impact of smart government usage is on information transparency. Implications for theory and practice are also offered. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Digital government; Digital transformation; Disruptive technology; E-government; Electronic government; Innovation; Smart government",""

This means that today's widely used cryptographic algorithms can soon become unsafe and need to be modified with quantum-safe (QS) cryptography. While much work is still needed in developing QS cryptographic algorithms, the institutional, organizational, and policy aspects of transitioning the current infrastructures have received less attention. This paper provides an empirical analysis of QS transition challenges and policy recommendations for moving to a QS situation. We analyzed the data collected through interviews with experts and practitioners from the Dutch government. The results reveal that institutional, organizational and policy aspects of QS transitions are interconnected, and solutions for QS transitions are scattered. Consequently, organizations may face a Catch-22 loop without further actionable approaches and planning for QS transitions. © 2023 The Authors","Adoption; Digital government; Implementation; Information infrastructures; Information sharing; Policy recommendations; Post-quantum cryptography; Quantum-safe transition",""

Unlike previous work on direct users of AI, this study focuses on the general public. Two online survey experiments presented participants with information on six types of ethical AI measures: legal compliance, ethics-by-design measures, data-gathering limitations, human-in-the-loop, non-discrimination, and technical robustness. Results reveal that general ethical AI information has little to no effect on trust, perceived trustworthiness or policy support among citizens. Prior attitudes and experiences, including privacy concerns, trust in government, and trust in AI, instead form good predictors. These findings suggest that short-term communication efforts on ethical AI practices have minimal impact. The findings suggest that a more long-term, comprehensive approach is necessary to building trust in governmental AI projects, addressing citizens' underlying concerns and experiences. As governments' use of AI becomes more ubiquitous, understanding citizen responses is crucial for fostering trust, perceived trustworthiness and policy support for AI-based policies and initiatives. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Ethical AI; Policy support; Transparency; Trust in AI; Trust in government citizen trust",""

In addressing this issue, this paper adopts a feminist perspective to enrich our understanding of how governments assume responsibility for their adoption of social media. The study contains a sentiment and thematic analysis of responses to a government video campaign on Facebook, which seeks to heighten public awareness about men's violence against women by highlighting problems surrounding sexist jokes. The video targets two audiences in terms of gender, resulting in various outcomes in sentiments, trolling, and trolling management. Results show disparities in sentiments between males and females, the diverse strategies employed in trolling, and how both users and the local government manage trolling. The local government deploys different strategies for trolling management, encompassing both engaging and non-engaging approaches. Notably, engagement is constrained to the targeted male audience and male trollers. The primary responsibility for trolling management is delegated to users, predominantly women, who become proxies for the local government. This dual practice of ignoring women as relevant stakeholders and utilizing them as proxies is considered a failure of responsibility. The study contributes to the advancement of citizen engagement research by delving into the intricate dynamics of trolling and trolling management within the specific context of government social media. Moreover, it sheds light on issues of responsibility inherent in the adoption of social media by governmental entities. © 2024 The Author","Citizen engagement; Facebook; Local government; Responsibility; Social media; Trolling; Trolling management",""

We argue that for digital government research, and for governments to be successful in smart city development in practice, it is necessary not only to understand living on a societal level, but also living aspects in the narrow context of homes. Citizens populate the smart city and are the ones who are supposed to use the services provided by the government. In this article we explore and analyze digital and analogue services in smart homes developed in a new city district. We have conducted observational studies in 53 apartments during an urban living expo which we analyze by applying a set of socio-technical design principles. The research question that guides the analysis is: “What tensions between values in digital and analogue services for a smart living can be revealed by a socio-technical perspective?”. We identify five tensions between: 1) being in control and being controlled, 2) intended and undesirable use of personal data, 3) digital and analogue smartness, 4) smart home visions and practices, and 5) environmental and social sustainability. By revealing these tensions, we contribute to an understanding of the complexity of smart living. We also contribute by highlighting the importance of applying a perspective that captures both technology and citizen and user issues (i.e., social aspects) when developing services in the smart home context. © 2024 The Authors","Services; Smart city; Smart home; Smart living; Socio-technical design principles; Tensions",""

Human involvement in AI systems has been suggested as a way to boost citizens' acceptance and perceptions of these systems' fairness. However, there is little empirical evidence to assess these claims. To address this gap, we conducted a pre-registered conjoint experiment in the UK regarding acceptance of AI in processing public permits: for immigration visas and parking permits. We hypothesise that greater human involvement boosts acceptance of AI in decision-making and associated perceptions of its fairness. We further hypothesise that greater human involvement mitigates the negative impact of certain AI features, such as inaccuracy, high cost, or data sharing. From our study, we find that more human involvement tends to increase acceptance, and that perceptions of fairness were less influenced. Yet, when substantial human discretion was introduced in parking permit scenarios, respondents preferred more limited human input. We found little evidence that human involvement moderates the impact of AI's unfavourable attributes. System-level factors such as high accuracy, the presence of an appeals system, increased transparency, reduced cost, non-sharing of data, and the absence of private company involvement all boost both acceptance and perceived procedural fairness. We find limited evidence that individual characteristics affect these results. The findings show how the design of AI systems can increase its acceptability to citizens for use in public services. © 2023 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence; Conjoint experiment; Human involvement; Public service",""

Thanks to technological advances in recent decades, governments can instantly reach citizens through multiple channels. Existing research on emergency messaging indicates that the effectiveness of messaging depends on multiple factors, including receivers' characteristics, message content and style, as well as the social and political contexts. However, what is still missing in the literature is a better understanding of the role of technology use for emergency messaging, particularly in local governments. Based on the Technology Affordances and Constraints Theory (TACT) and a practice perspective, we analyzed interview data from eighteen local emergency management agencies in the United States to investigate four questions: (1) what digital artifacts are used for writing and sending messages? (2) how do the artifacts afford emergency managers in writing and sending messages? (3) what are the constraints that impede effective messaging? and (4) how do governments cope with those difficulties? We find four types of artifacts involved in emergency messaging, their affordances, and constraints, as well as some strategies for mitigating negative impacts.

ULLs aim to provide a space for different parties to research, develop, and test solutions to urban problems whilst engaging with local communities. Their experimental approach to urban innovation and to public-private collaboration makes flexibility, openness, and informality important. However, ULLs are also confronted with existing legal frameworks, responsibilities, and liabilities. Whilst they aim at shared decision-making and horizontality, they must navigate public and private interests, and interact with local government as well. To understand these dynamics, this article examines the legal and organizational structures of ULLs, the factors and trade-offs that influence it, and the role municipal government plays in in these structures. This article analyzes the different forms and trajectories of ULLs in practice, through semi-structured interviews held in four labs in Amsterdam. Through qualitative research, we found that 1) ULLs are partnerships that exist on a spectrum of formalization, from informal to highly formal; 2) the degree of formalization is influenced by financial, legal, and organizational factors that change over time; 3) each degree of formalization is associated to trade-offs, even if these trade-offs are not explicitly formulated by the people involved; 4) tensions arise from the municipality's double role as public authority and as partner. We conclude that ULLs could gain from clearly identifying the legal frameworks that condition their structure, actions, and future. © 2023 The Authors","Accountability; Collaboration; Innovation; Living lab; Local government; Municipality; Public-private partnerships; Smart city; Urban living lab",""

Drawing on a dataset of 30,558 corruption-related court judgments in China, this study employs hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) by integrating individual-level data and provincial-level data to yield three major findings. First, agent-controlled transparency is more likely to decrease the concealment of petty corruption than grand corruption. Furthermore, agent-controlled transparency is more likely to reduce the latency of autocorruption than transactive corruption, which is usually disguised in normal social interactions. Third, when the scale and form of corruption are combined into four types, namely petty autocorruption, grand autocorruption, petty transactive corruption, and grand transactive corruption, agent-controlled transparency is more likely to reduce the latent period of petty autocorruption than that of other types. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Agent-controlled transparency; China; Corruption latency; Petty corruption; Transactive corruption",""

Addressing the required interoperability principles in public service architectures is difficult, since a multitude of different layers of interoperability as well as of architecture development must be covered in complex real-world situations. Architecture development frameworks provide an instrument to systematically and holistically design and manage architectures of complex and interoperable digital public service contexts. Interoperable public service architectures resulting from the application of architecture development frameworks further need constant evaluation and modification to keep these architectures relevant and up-to-date. Different methodologies such as the “Design Science Research Methodology” (DSRM) or Enterprise Architecture Frameworks like “The Open Group Architecture Framework” (TOGAF) provide methodical foundations in the creation of interoperable public service solutions. However, these methodologies only target some of the needed aspects at a time. To address this challenge, the paper proposes an agile framework for the design, evaluation, and maintenance of interoperable public service architectures, based on DSRM, TOGAF, and other relevant approaches from literature. The “Framework for Interoperable Service Architecture Development” (FISAD) is designed following the DSRM. FISAD comprises seven phases, which integrate the four interoperability layers put forward in the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) and the architectural design phases (business, data, application and technology architecture) covered in the Architecture Development Method (ADM) of TOGAF in an incremental fashion along the DSRM. To demonstrate how it works, FISAD is applied to the use-case of harmonizing pre-qualification and Digital Purchasing Systems (DPS) processes in the pre-award phase of public procurement. The effectiveness of FISAD is verified on the use-case, providing further insights for the realization of interoperability along a systematic and holistic approach. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Agile architecture development; E-procurement; Interoperability; Methodical framework; Public services",""

We also argue that traditional urban governance modes help explain emerging modes and the nature of citizen-government interactions. Thus, a combination of the sociotechnical view with the modes of urban governance as a theoretical approach was used to understand the dynamics of emerging governance modes in smart city initiatives. Two cases were studied using a longitudinal qualitative case study and temporal bracketing analysis for an in-depth understanding. Our findings evidenced that the configuration of the elements, governance mode, information and communication technology (ICT) and types of citizen-government interaction varies from one initiative to another and changes over time, across multiple sociotechnical networks in practice, which leads to emerging new governance modes. We highlight that a new understanding of smart urban governance for sustainable development in the digital age needs to be developed as a dynamic process.

However, the literature remains fragmented, with researchers in social science disciplines like public administration and political science, and the fast-moving fields of AI, ML, and robotics, all developing concepts in relative isolation. Although there are calls to formalize the emerging study of AI in government, a balanced account that captures the full depth of theoretical perspectives needed to understand the consequences of embedding AI into a public sector context is lacking. Here, we unify efforts across social and technical disciplines by first conducting an integrative literature review to identify and cluster 69 key terms that frequently co-occur in the multidisciplinary study of AI. We then build on the results of this bibliometric analysis to propose three new multifaceted concepts for understanding and analysing AI-based systems for government (AI-GOV) in a more unified way: (1) operational fitness, (2) epistemic alignment, and (3) normative divergence. Finally, we put these concepts to work by using them as dimensions in a conceptual typology of AI-GOV and connecting each with emerging AI technical measurement standards to encourage operationalization, foster cross-disciplinary dialogue, and stimulate debate among those aiming to rethink government with AI. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Government; Machine learning; Public administration; Review; Standards; Typology",""

Despite this increase, few studies have explicitly analysed its relation to good administration. Good administration is regulations and norms aimed at securing the correctness of administrative decisions as well as the legitimacy of these and is often associated with underlying values such as transparency, equality of treatment and accountability. Based on a thematic analysis of qualitative interviews with 43 key public administration stakeholders in a wide array of policy areas in Denmark, insiders of government machinery are shown to perceive relations between automated decision-making and good administration as manifold. Automated, administrative decision-making is articulated as providing both opportunities for supporting good administration and undermining good administration. Six values of good administration particularly related to automated, administrative decision-making are identified: Carefulness; Respecting-individual-rights; Professionalism; Trustworthiness; Responsiveness and Empowerment. Put simply, risks to good administration can be expected to occur if administrative bodies apply automated, administrative decision-making, while opportunities must be actively nurtured through managerial attention. Despite popular conceptions of the threat of “robotic government”, the conclusions of this study indicate a need for a more pragmatic view of relations of automated, administrative decision-making and good administration balanced between outright techno-optimism and techno-pessimism. © 2023 The Author","Administrative decisions; Automated decision-making; Digital government; Good administration; Techno-optimism; Techno-pessimism; Values",""

Yet co-design principles are rarely practiced in a meaningful way for people with disability, resulting in digital government systems that are obstructive and inaccessible to many. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges of disability inclusion through a qualitative case study of participatory digital government in Australia. It centres on the case of “Nadia”, an artificially intelligent virtual assistant created in 2016 through a co-design approach that ultimately ended in failure, as the project never progressed beyond the design stage. Based on research involving interviews with technology developers, government representatives, and people with disability who had input into the design of Nadia, the article makes three main contributions. First, it clarifies conceptually the importance of inclusion as a process, rather than an outcome, of digital government, reframing design as a matter of inclusion. Second, in examining why the project failed, the paper identifies aspects of digital government culture, organization, and practice that impede disability co-design, namely, a lack of institutionalized support and resistance to sharing power. Third, it highlights disability as an area for exploring new possibilities with technology and its limitations, showing the significant role that disabled people play in shaping technology and its advancements. © 2023 The Author","Co-design; Digital government; Disability; Inclusion; Nadia; Virtual assistant",""

The focus of this study is to identify privacy risk factors in the process of developing OGD. Using a mixed-method design, we developed a privacy risk identification framework based on evidence from China. According to the results of qualitative interviews, the privacy risk identification framework mainly includes five risk dimensions: data risk, institutional risk, technical risk, structural risk, and behavioral risk. We identified 17 risk factors under these five dimensions. We further developed the measurement items for each risk factor and verified the indicator framework through quantitative methods. Our research provides a theoretical basis for identifying the privacy risks in OGD, supporting governments in discovering and dealing with them accordingly. Future research can continuously explore potential privacy risks arising from merging technologies such as generative artificial intelligence when applied to OGD. © 2023","Mixed methods; Open government data; Privacy risk identification framework; Privacy risks",""

However, global climate negotiations are characterized by paradoxes and tensions that complicate the resolution of the problem. Thus, the use of digital technologies can only be effective if orchestrated with an understanding of underlying global climate negotiations paradoxes. The objective of this paper is to identify research needs related to the intersection of global climate negotiations, paradoxes, and the use of digital technologies. We propose a research agenda based on paradoxes of global climate negotiations at different levels of online interaction. Two streams of research inform our research agenda: paradox theory and research on online communities. We illustrate our reasoning by discussing digital support for the United Nation's Conference of the Parties (COP) meetings for climate negotiations. The research agenda contributes to the digital governance field by sensitizing the community of the underlying paradoxes in global governance. The combination of online communities research and paradox theory offer novel guidance on complexity and potential challenges when applying digital technologies in global climate negotiations.

To address this gap, this research conducted an analysis on four cases of digital transformation in three European PA settings (i.e., Denmark, the Netherlands, and the UK). The findings revealed complexities that pose the key challenges to systems interoperability and integrability, which are crucial in any digital transformation project.

In this qualitative study, we explore how public organizations strategically manage the adoption of AI. Managing AI adoption in the public sector is complex because of the inherent tension between public organizations' identity, characterized by formal and rigid structures, and the demands of AI innovation that require experimentation and flexibility. Our findings show that public organizations navigate this tension either by creating separate departments for data science teams, or by integrating data science teams into already existing operational departments. The case studies reveal that separation improves the technical expertise and capabilities of the organization, whereas integration improves the alignment between AI and primary processes. The findings also show that both approaches are characterized by different AI adoption barriers. We empirically identify the processes and routines public organizations develop to overcome these barriers. © 2023","Adoption; Ambidexterity; Artificial intelligence; Contextual integration; Management; Public sector; Structural separation",""

Nevertheless, there are no conclusive findings on online citizen participation and inclusive policymaking. This study adds in line with the discussion with a fresh perspective of institutional bias. It presents new evidence by examining the process, participants, policy agenda, and sentiments of public opinions from the government-led and Internet-empowered citizen participation regarding the 2017–2035 Shanghai Master Plan. Four findings are reported based on the in-depth case study with text and sentiment analysis. First, the government-led model provides institutionalized opportunities for citizen engagement throughout the policy process, while the Internet-empowered citizen participation is characterized by contingency and ad hoc. Second, the government-led model remains elite-dominated, while the Internet empowers a wider scope of stakeholders with an open and popularized participation platform. Third, the public opinion from the Internet-empowered model often goes beyond or even against the pre-defined official principles and goals. In contrast, the civic discussion in the government-led model influences policy by changing the sequence of policy agenda or providing focus within the official setting. Fourth, citizens, especially the experts, are more likely to give positive feedback in the government-led model than the Internet-empowered approach. These findings confirm and identify the remaining institutional bias that hinders inclusive policymaking in the Internet age. Theoretically, it reminds scholars to examine the institutional arrangements regarding citizen participation carefully. Practically, it indicates that the central government could facilitate inclusive policymaking at the local level by reducing the institutional bias of the government-led approach and utilizing text and sentiment analysis to urge the local government's response to Internet-empowered public opinion. © 2023","Citizen participation; Government-led; Inclusive policymaking; Institutional bias; Internet-empowered",""

This means that in the near future, data-driven decisions based on data, rather than subjectivity or experience, will be the driving force behind society. However, since valuable and useful data is bound to be generated from personal information, how to safely utilize personal information is becoming an important topic in the big data era. To protect personal information in this environment, data services and database providers have increased their focus on the implementation of de-identification, a technique that can protect personal information while maintaining the usefulness of the data. Moreover, many countries have introduced new policies and laws focusing on the de-identification of personal information. Accordingly, this paper compares and analyzes how the European Union, the United States, Japan, and South Korea have recently adopted the concept of de-identification in their own personal information protection laws, and presents common trends and implications. As a comparative framework, each country's conceptual classification system related to de-identification, legal treatment, data controller obligations, and de-identification procedures was included. This study identifies the shifts made in each country's regulatory system following the introduction of the concept of de-identification. These include a shift from a binary approach to an approach that considers the identifiability spectrum, from a belief in anonymization to regulation from a risk management perspective, and from a focus on de-identification methods, to responsibility for follow-up management. This study contributes to the establishment of specialized knowledge of de-identification practices by empirically examining the current status of de-identification information-related legal systems adopted by major countries/regions. Also, the study proved the actualization of theory by confirming that the de-identification policy approach from the perspective of risk management is actually applied to the laws of each country. In addition, the attempt to present a framework for systematic comparison of de-identification systems by country provides a new perspective that can trace the trend of future de-identification system changes on a consistent basis. In addition, this study brings the gradual expansion of data policy research by expanding the research on de-identified information, which has been studied mainly in Europe and the United States, to case studies in Japan and South Korea. © 2023","Anonymization; de-identification; Personal information; personal information protection act; Pseudonymization",""

First, digitization reduces administrative burdens by streamlining access to digital services, yet it reproduces administrative burdens for digitally disadvantaged users. Second, digital-by-default policies help realize public value generated by digitization, yet they create economic value for street-level intermediaries to monetize digital inclusion. Third, private street-level intermediaries contribute to digital inclusion and benefit economically from sustaining digital exclusion. This study contributes to the literature on digital inclusion and administrative burden by revealing and explaining the complex and paradoxical mechanisms through which digital inclusion is enacted at the street-level.

To tackle this issue, this article sets out to answer the research question: what is the role of digital government in the transition towards a circular economy? Driven by this research question, we conduct a review on 88 empirical studies in the Information Systems (IS) and digital government fields and discuss existing research foci and gaps in relation to the types of digital technologies used, the types of stakeholders involved, the stages of the product life cycle, and the type of resources that governments draw on to advance the circular economy transition.

By applying Ostrom's (2007) institutional analysis and development framework to Taiwanese Regional- and Sectoral-ISACs to qualitative data from 40 in-depth interviews across central/local governments, private companies, state-owned enterprises, and non-governmental organizations, this paper analyzes the institutional rules-in-use at the operational, collective, and constitutional levels. Our qualitative empirical study aims to induct the various institutional rules-in-use embedded in the ISAC networks, and its findings regarding inter-organizational crisis-management information sharing may have implications for cross-boundary participation in other nations. © 2023 The Authors","Cybersecurity; Information sharing and analysis center; Information-sharing; Institutional analysis and development framework",""

A survey of 330 public records requesters in the United States revealed sharp disparities in how requesters perceive fees. Private citizens, journalists, academics, and nonprofit requesters were more likely to identify excessive fees as a serious impediment, whereas commercial requesters and lawyers did not. The study also found differences in how fees are experienced at the federal, state, and local levels. Findings suggest that fees are particularly problematic for certain requester types, notably average citizens and those seeking records in the public interest, and that fees may therefore obstruct the public's ability to become informed and better self-govern.

As a result of our holistic analysis, we identify and discuss current trends and challenges in the development and evaluation of chatbots in the public administration sector, such as focusing the use of the conversational agents on the search for government information, documents and services –leaving citizen consultation and collaboration aside–, and conducting preliminary evaluations of prototypes in limited studies, lacking experiments on deployed systems, with metrics beyond effectiveness and usability –e.g., metrics related to the generation of public values. Addressing some of the identified challenges, we build and evaluate two novel chatbots that present advances in the access to open government data and citizen participation content.

While prior studies have contributed to understanding the institutional and organizational determinants of government digital services, much less is known about their utilization and the actual public value they generate from the perspective of the citizen, particularly in developing countries. Some research on technology, economic, and other social divides even suggests that both the use and value of digital services are potentially limited. In this paper, we apply the Delone and McLean model, a well-established information systems theory, to examine citizens' use of government digital services and their perceptions of public value derived from such use. Based on data from a comprehensive national phone survey across 32 Mexican States with 4300 respondents, our structural equation modeling reveals that system quality is the most significant predictor of use and user satisfaction with digital services. Furthermore, use and user satisfaction lead to public value as measured by the conveniences, flexibilities, and process simplifications the system affords.

This prompts an understanding of how public organizations should organize in order to derive value from AI, as well as in which forms can value be realized. Against this background, this paper examines how AI capabilities can lead to organizational performance by inducing change in key organizational activities. Using a survey-based study, we collected data from European public organizations regarding the indirect effect AI capabilities have on organizational performance. Data was collected from 168 municipalities from three European countries (Norway, Germany, and Finland) and analyzed by means of structural equation modeling. Our findings show that AI capabilities have a positive effect on process automation, cognitive insight generation, and cognitive engagement. While process automation and cognitive insights are having a positive effect on organizational performance, we found that cognitive engagement negatively affects organizational performance. Our findings document the key resources that constitute an AI capability and showcase the effects of fostering such capabilities on key organizational activities, and in turn organizational performance. © 2022 The Authors","Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence capabilities; Organizational impact; Organizational performance",""

At the same time, a debate about its applications, safety, and privacy is raging. In three studies, we explored how UK respondents perceive the usage of AI in various public sector decisions. Our results are fourfold. First, we found that people prefer AI to have considerably less decisional weight than various human decision-makers; those being: politicians, citizens, and (human) experts. Secondly, our findings revealed that people prefer AI to provide input and advice to these human decision-makers, rather than letting AI make decisions by itself. Thirdly, although AI is seen as contributing less to perceived legitimacy than these human decision-makers, similar to (human) experts, its contribution is seen more in terms of output legitimacy than in terms of input and throughput legitimacy. Finally, our results suggest that the involvement of AI is perceived more suitable for decisions that are low (instead of high) ideologically-charged. Overall, our findings thus show that people are rather skeptical towards using AI in the public domain, but this does not imply that they want to exclude AI entirely from the decision-making process. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial Intelligence (AI); Decision type; Decisional weight; Hybrid decision-making; Legitimacy; Public sector decisions; Roles",""

Theoretically, during a pandemic, fear can be contained at reasonable levels by governments counterbalancing uncertainty with information. However, there is no empirical evidence on how the flow of information during a crisis can influence emotional states among the population. In this process, social media appears to be a valuable tool for governments to observe emotional response in a population. In the light of this and within the context of the Italian government's social media campaign #iorestoacasa (‘I'm staying at home’) launched during the Covid-19 crisis, the current study utilises text analytics to explore the relationship between government and press communication, and the level of fear expressed by citizens through more than 200 thousand #iorestoacasa tweets. The results highlight how the content of the messages evolved in the early part of the outbreak and during the social media campaign. They suggest that in Italy the discussion regarding the efforts made by the European Council to find common solutions for dealing with the emergency has prompted a positive influence on public mood. Conversely, messages about people's individual vulnerability and the associated sense of an external locus of control correlated positively with levels of fear.

This lack of understanding has generated to a limited knowledge base regarding the usage of these services. Furthermore, there is a dearth of longitudinal research in this area, further impeding our understanding of the topic. This study aims to analyze the diffusion and the divide in citizens' use of e-government services over time. Using the repeated cross-sectional survey data (2012−2021) of the Korean citizens' use of the web-based and mobile e-government services, we found that citizens' use of e-government services has generally increased over the past 10 years, with information transaction services (e.g. Gov24) being the most widely used, followed by financial transaction services (e.g. Hometax). However, the speed of e-participation services (e.g. E-people) diffusion and its usage rate over time is much slower and lower than other types of e-government services. Web-based and mobile e-government services have been showing similar trends of change. The usage rate of web-based e-government services, however, has been slightly higher than that of mobile e-government services. The divide in the usage of e-government services for digitally vulnerable groups has been generally decreasing. However, the usage gap of e-participation services is very sensitive to the yearly changes due to its low usage rate, making the pattern of the usage gap change irregularly. Lastly, the divide caused by intersectionality factors such as the elderly with low incomes is far more serious than those caused by single factors. The study's findings emphasize the importance for digital government leaders and managers to focus on citizens' use of e-government services, considering factors such as service type, user group, and platform. This attention is crucial in promoting digital inclusion and equity, ultimately addressing the issue of the divide in the use of e-government services. © 2023","Digital Diffusion and Divide; Korean E-government; Longitudinal study; Mobile government service; Vulnerable Citizens",""

The vision and objectives how DT should be realized on state level is portrayed in well-crafted DT policies. Yet, little is known how governments, as strategic actors, see their role in the DT and how they frame these documents. In this paper, we argue that policymaking about DT is isomorphic in the global context, rather than a differentiator for countries to gain a competitive edge.

This view consists on a linear, progressive and add-on evolution of digital government, emphasizes the critical role of technology, and the learning sharing or imitation among governments. Official websites and portals have been subject of various studies using multiple metrics and indicators. The existing measurement approaches and traditional estimations present different limitations for assessing the complex characterization of digital government evolution overtime. Up-to-day there is no agreement of what constitute the proper approach to assess digital government evolution and more sophisticate techniques need to be developed to capture a more realistic metric of digital government advance. This article challenges the assumptions of the evolutionary perspective and argues in favor of the potential of the computational tools for the evaluation of these assessment tools of digital government performance. In particular, the technique of neural networks analysis and self-organized maps have the potential to describe the multi-parametric characterization of multiple metrics and indicators of this phenomenon and its evolution overtime. A database of a digital government ranking of Mexican states during the period 2009–2015 is used as a case study. This computational technique was useful data mining and visualization tool of patterns and profiles of digital government performance overtime. The procedure automatically arranges the available data into clusters of characteristics that subsequently are illustrated using visualizations through bi-dimensional maps to analyze the evolution of digital government advance. The results indicate that the evolutionary assumptions do not hold across states in Mexico and the dimensions of information, participation and transaction are relevant for improving digital government evolution overtime.

By combining various methods (traceroute measurements, passive DNS data and geolocation), we determine where and how domains are hosted, as well as the network paths taken by citizens' traffic to them. We uncover different strategies and degrees of autonomy, as well as difficult tradeoffs between different risks to autonomy, some of which might be larger than the risks associated with the dependency on foreign providers. This includes transnational providers being used by all countries, with geopolitical rivals even being tenants on the same network and traffic between citizens and governments regularly traversing international borders.

Using dynamic panel methods and multiple estimation approaches to address endogeneity, we show, first and foremost, that in both adjudication and enforcement a shift to electronic case-processing unequivocally increases judicial productivity and court clearance rate while reducing case disposition times. In adjudication, electronification exhibits diminishing marginal returns: additional electronification does not yield further efficacy gains once the share of electronically-processed court caseload is between 50% and 75%. We do not find similarly stark evidence of plateauing of the effect of electronification in enforcement, a key court activity domain where attaining fully electronic case-processing would thus be especially advantageous.

Participants utilized a crowdsourcing survey platform to report their preferences for interaction processes designed with distinct sets of social characteristics. Valid data were obtained from 371 participants and analyzed using a multinomial logit model. The results indicate that (in order from highest to lowest impact) emotional intelligence, proactivity, identity consistency, and conscientiousness significantly influence the citizens' preferences. Identity consistency has a negative effect, whereas the other factors all have positive impacts. It was also determined that some of these correlations are influenced by the participants' individual characteristics, such as age, gender, and prior experience with chatbots.

Indeed, making an effective impact on OGD requires users to activate its value. Therefore, this study aims to propose a model to explore factors that hinder or facilitate public value creation using OGD from the public sector employee perspective. Using the DeLone and McLean (2003) model as a theoretical basis with the combination of the Moore (1995) framework, the study model was validated in the Australian public sector, using partial least square structural equation modelling. The results of this study support the validity of the research model and discover the factors that have a significant influence on public value creation through the use of OGD in the Australian public sector. Findings reveal that employee's OGD portal use and their satisfaction significantly predict the public value of OGD, while the OGD portal quality, open data quality and service support indirectly affect the public value of OGD. Furthermore, the moderator analysis suggests that awareness of the value of OGD among public sector employees has a critical effect on the delivery of public value. The proposed theoretical framework can be used to assess the factors affecting OGD public value creation by users in the public sector, which can help researchers and developers to improve and update their system, based on the results. © 2024 The Authors","Australian public sector; Open data quality; Open government data; Open government data portal quality; Public value; Service support",""

Studies in this area show how digital technologies are equipped to support more participative information-sharing and provide dialogic tools for interactions with forums. However, no research has yet examined how to engage forums and enable web-based accountability relationships. We address this gap by highlighting the need to adapt social media communication strategies for topic-specific discussions. Our analysis builds on a database containing 25,485 posts extracted from social media platforms used by 13 Polish municipalities and focuses on two different matters of discussion: posts related to public health during the COVID-19 pandemic and non-COVID-19 related posts. Moreover, during the analysis, we consider two social media communication strategies: passive and participatory. Our findings indicate that both communication strategies can generate forum engagement, which subsequently supports web-based accountability. They also demonstrate that, to support forum engagement, municipalities should avoid one-style-fits-all approaches to communication and instead tailor strategies to the specific subject of discussion. This study contributes to expanding academic debates on web-based accountability by illustrating how the use of social media communication strategies can help engage citizens in public forums to enhance accountability relationships. © 2023","Citizen engagement; Engaging communication; Public accountability; Social media; Web-based accountability",""

Scholars agree with the potential for proactivity in public services and study some aspects of the topic, and some publications deal with the concept of proactivity itself. However, opinions regarding the characteristics of proactive public services diverge in both research and practice, and despite—or maybe because of—the growing body of research, the literature still lacks conceptual clarity. We address this issue by developing a taxonomy for proactive public services using Nickerson, Varshney, and Muntermann's (2013) taxonomy-development method. Using eight empirical and conceptual iterations that draw on a structured literature review, two semi-structured interviews, investigation of 67 real-world objects, and an evaluation with nine potential users, we propose a taxonomy of eight dimensions and 23 characteristics. The outcome of this work enriches scientific knowledge about digital government by detailing the concept of a proactive public service and serving as a basis for further research. Moreover, practitioners can be inspired by the 23 characteristics of proactive public services to identify possible next steps in the design of their services, such as determining which proactive public services are feasible and in what form. In addition to the taxonomy, our collection of 67 practical examples of proactive public services from a variety of countries contributes to digital government research and practice. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Digital government; Digital public service; Digital service; E-government; Proactive public service; Public administration; Taxonomy",""

Theoretically, we draw on public value theory, analyzing chatbots' impact on public services, administration, and the relationship between citizens and public service providers. Our analysis shows that chatbots have an impact on public values and public value creation, particularly by improving citizens' access to public services and public service providers insights into citizens' needs. The findings suggest that citizens and public service providers experience chatbots as an improvement in terms of access and efficiency, albeit not a massive shift.

The fundamental reason for this problem lies in the contradiction between the information disclosure required for effective e-government and the information concentration characteristic of unitary countries. To identify the impact of e-government on fiscal deficits in this context, we take two e-government pilot projects in China as quasi-natural experiments and conduct difference-in-differences analysis of county-level data from 1997 to 2018. Through a common trend test, a placebo test, a lagged outcome variable design and the difference-in-differences with propensity score matching method, we validate our finding that e-government can effectively reduce the fiscal deficit of local governments. This function is mainly realized through the application of media tools and expansion of the scale of local enterprises. However, the impact of e-government on fiscal deficit differs significantly between regions with different levels of economic development. The effect is more obvious in regions with a poorer economic foundation. Our findings indicate the importance of e-government construction in unitary developing countries. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","County government; Difference-in-differences; E-government; Fiscal deficit",""

However, translating technological opportunities into concrete public value for public administrations is still limited. One of the factors hindering this progress is the lack of AI capability within public organisations. The research found that various components of AI capability are essential for successfully developing and using AI technologies, including tangible, intangible, and human-related factors. There is a distinction between the AI capability to develop and the AI capability to implement AI technologies, with more administrations capable of the former but finding difficulties in the latter. A lack of in-house technical expertise to maintain and update the AI systems, legal challenges in deploying developed AI systems, and the capability to introduce changes in the organisation to ensure the system remains operational and used by relevant end-users are among the most critical limiting factors for long-term use of AI by public administrations. The research underlines the strong complementarity between historical eGovernment developments and the capability to deploy AI technologies. The study suggests that funding alone may not be enough to acquire AI capability, and public administrations need to focus on both the capability to develop and implement AI technologies. The research emphasizes that human skillsets, both technical and non-technical, are essential for the successful implementation of AI in public administration. © 2023 The Authors","AI-capability; Artificial intelligence; Digital government; Digital government transformation; Emerging technologies; Public sector innovation",""

Among those nations, Canada is particularly noteworthy: Canada was the first nation to implement a national AI strategy, and more recently, Canada's federal and provincial governments have designed and implemented a wide range of initiatives that attempt to intervene in a variety of potential impacts associated with AI systems. We present a semi-systematic review and synthesis of 84 of those AI governance initiatives. We find that those 84 initiatives predominantly focus on developing programs, policies, and strategic plans to intervene in industry and innovation, technology production and use, AI research, and public administration. Conversely, we find relatively little focus on developing ethics statements or standards, as well as little focus on intervening in social and workforce development services, AI education and training, and digital infrastructure. We suggest three opportunities for researchers and four opportunities for practitioners that, if enacted, would strengthen the overall state of Canadian AI governance. Our study contributes a novel macro-scale synthesis of AI governance initiatives within a national context, as well as practical opportunities for intervening in national AI governance challenges related to evaluation of initiative outcomes, public trust and participation in initiatives, AI impact representation in initiatives, and national unification. © 2024 The Authors","AI ethics; Artificial intelligence; Content analysis; Governance; Literature review; Policy; Strategy",""

Within this new scenario, many methodological proposals that use SM data have been put forward for predicting election results. However, the most common approach, based on the volume and sentiment analysis of mentions on Twitter, has been frequently criticized and challenged. Thus, recent surveys have indicated new directions, such as the use of data from more than one SM platform, the adoption of nonlinear machine learning (ML) models, and the validation of methodologies and experiments in different elections. In this context, the present paper proposes SoMEN, the Social Media framework for Election Nowcasting, a framework composed of a process and an ML model for nowcasting election results based on SM performance as features and with offline polls as labeled data. It also defines SoMEN-DC, an execution strategy for SoMEN that enables continuous prediction during the campaign (DC). The proposed metrics and framework were applied to some of the main recent presidential elections in Latin America: Argentina (2019), Brazil (2018), Colombia (2018), and Mexico (2018). More than 65,000 posts were collected from the SM profiles of candidates on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram with data from 195 presidential polls. Results have demonstrated that it was possible to achieve a high level of accuracy in predicting the final vote share of the candidates and to make daily predictions, providing competitive or better results than the traditional polls. The strategies put forward in this study have attempted to address several of the current challenges in this research area and have indicated a new manner of how to face the problems.

One potential solution to increase the productivity and efficiency of the federal government is to adopt AI technologies and devices. AI technologies and devices already provide unique capabilities, services, and products, as demonstrated by smart homes, autonomous vehicles, delivery drones, GPS navigation, Chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard, and virtual assistants such as Amazon's Alexa. However, incorporating massive AI into the US federal government would present several challenges, including ethical and legal concerns, outdated infrastructure, unprepared human capital, institutional obstacles, and a lack of social acceptance. How can US policymakers promote policies that increase AI usage in the face of these challenges?

In response, scholars suggest that public organizations be proactive in digital public services such that the organizations approach their clients, rather than the other way around. In the most extreme form of proactivity, clients do not have to do anything to receive a public service. Although various examples of proactive public services are in use, how proactivity changes the conceptual understanding of digital public services remains unclear. Therefore, we derive the changes that proactivity causes in a conceptualization of digital public service by means of a conceptual analysis through the lens of a seminal theoretical work on proactivity. The results indicate that proactivity can ensure equal accessibility to a subset of public services, rely on more comprehensive integration of IT systems on the back end, and change how value is co-created in the service process. We formulate the changes as propositions that future work can investigate empirically and discuss proactive digital public services as a way to reduce clients' administrative burden.

Using a real-life dataset of an online petition platform, we show that the proposed model performs well in several important evaluation metrics when compared with benchmark models. This study offers several contributions. First, we present how to translate these concepts into textual features of petitions that can be understood by computers to improve prediction of petition success. The predictive models developed and the patterns of online petitioning identified enhance our understanding of collective actions on online petition platforms. In addition, we demonstrate that we can develop a better predictive model by adopting both supervised and unsupervised approaches of model development together with datasets that are exogenous from online petition platforms. Further examination of the predictive models in future may enable us to define vague concepts in a systematic way. On practical implications, our proposed text-mining model enables policy makers to handle a large volume of social data in a relatively objective manner. This is conducive to civic participation in e-democracy. The model may help policy makers identify potentially popular issues and prevent issue expansion at an early stage to mitigate the possible incursion of social cost. Moreover, by developing a predictive model based on our approach, citizens can compare different petition texts to determine their chances of success and post texts that have a higher predicted rate of success. © 2023","Agenda setting; Collective action; Feature engineering; Online petitions; Text mining",""

Electronic identification (e-ID) technology is needed for secure identification authentication with regard to digital services. This study uses socio-technical systems theory to analyse the development and transfer of e-ID technology in the context of public-private partnerships (PPPs). Recent studies have shown that the ‘digital divide’ is prominent between ethnic minorities and the majority populations. Yet there is a scarcity of studies investigating inequalities related to obtaining an e-ID, which is required to access digital public services. Our empirical results show that transnational migrants had lower access to e-ID, which may hinder their ability to access public services. We used representative Finnish population-based survey data (FinMonik study) to analyse general socio-demographic and migration-specific factors associated with not having an e-ID. Our results showed that approximately 91% of the respondents had an e-ID. This is lower than the 98% among the general working-age population. There are significant differences in having an e-ID between different migrant groups. The lowest rate (84%) was observed for migrants who had moved to Finland from outside the EU and OECD countries. Regression analysis showed that lower socio-economic status and weak local language skills were associated with not having an e-ID. We argue that e-ID as a socio-technical system includes unintended contradictions stemming from PPP when the non-discrimination principle of the welfare state clashes with the private sector's operational logics and interests. We argue that the government should remain accountable for ensuring the safety, efficacy, quality, and adequate access to welfare state services developed in PPP. © 2023 The Authors","Digital inequalities; E-ID; Electronic identification; Migrants; Socio-technical systems theory; Survey study",""

The findings show that even a delayed and unhelpful response can have a positive impact on citizens' satisfaction with the government. This effect is mediated by the level of perceived government responsiveness. Moreover, citizens are affected more by the usefulness than by the timeliness of the government's responses.

The focus lies on the transparency and the ecological sustainability of AI as two key challenges tied to possible long-term impacts on societies. Findings from survey data representative of the German population show overall moderate to strong support for the government regulating AI. Perceived regulatory competence of policymakers is positively associated with citizens' support for soft regulation. Lower trust in tech companies is linked to a lower readiness to rely on soft regulation, but not to more demand for hard regulation. While regulatory preferences barely map on political conflict lines, people's future orientation emerges as a strong correlate of support for both hard and soft regulation.

The effect of integrity is consistent across the five scenarios, and the Average Marginal Effects (AMEs) indicate that the effect is largest when the public assesses FRT acceptability in public protests - that presents the greatest privacy concern to citizens. This study contributes to the emerging literature on AI technology adoption in public entities through the institutional trustworthiness lens. It expands the application of the institutional trustworthiness framework into the local context of U.S. police adopting FRT and highlights contextual implications for public organizations adopting intrusive technologies.

From the perspective of the whole process of OGD utilization, ecosystems have various types of ecological characteristics such as data flow, information expression and value realization. To this end, this paper proposes a new perspective of viewing OGD ecosystems across data, information and business based on the theories of supernetworks, data value chains, information ecosystems and business ecosystems, and further explores the ecosystems through a case study in Guizhou, China. We conclude that the hierarchical division of OGD ecosystems as a whole is clearer, and the focus of each layer is more focused; the cross-level dynamics mechanism of the ecosystem, and the information transmission mechanism assumed by the information ecosystem make the three layers interact with each other; and the different actors play different roles in the three layers and occupy different ecological position.

However, they are almost unanimous in presenting that the results are not better than chance. In this context, this study aims to investigate the feasibility of predicting electoral results based only on Twitter, discover the main issues, and draw guidelines for future alternative directions. For this, we reviewed the evolution of election polling and predictions, including the “polling crises” of 1936 and 1948, and their similarities with current approaches. We also built on the official SM platforms' documentation and on our experience collecting and analyzing large-scale data from many SM platforms. Lastly, we analyzed nine reviews on predicting elections with SM data from 2013 to 2021. We observed that, contrary to initial expectations, most of the current research with Twitter has been unable to solve many of the challenges encountered since initial studies, and also shares many of the characteristics of unsuccessful straw polls performed before 1936. We illustrate that by highlighting the impracticability of polling over Twitter due to several biases and technical barriers, the need for external data, the high dependency on the arbitrary decisions of researchers, and the constant change in platforms' scenarios, that may invalidate specific models. Lastly, we indicate some of the possible future directions, such as a focus on creating repeatable processes; the use of SM data as part of statistical models, instead of polling; diversifying the input data sources, including multiple SM platforms and non-SM data such as polls and economic indicators; using machine learning for regression of the vote share, rather than for sentiment analysis; and dealing with the uncertainty of the highly divergent polling results. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Elections; Government; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Twitter",""

The case provides one of few examples in which a digitally highly advanced state publicly dealt with a large-scale cyber risk at the heart of its digital government. Estonia overcame the crisis without constraining the affected infrastructures' functionality, while other countries did not. The article examines a seeming paradox of 'digital government continuity': Crisis managers can not afford to shut down widely adopted, yet vulnerable, digital systems. However, the vulnerable systems' continued operation contributes to their resilience.

In this context, national AI strategies play a pivotal role. This study uses combined qualitative research methods analyzing 28 national AI strategies (i.e., the texts). Our aim is to delve into how governments define and position AI applications within the public sector. Specifically, the study explores how the texts convey AI's application in this context employing a public value(s) perspective. Its discursive analytical approach coupled with a comprehensive take on public value theory (Moore, 1995) engenders novel insights into national discourses on AI in the public sector. Against this background we draw on public administration and policy research in our analysis of three dominant discourses that we identify in the texts, i.e. empowerment through information, enhanced administrative practices, and improved service delivery. We find that the discourses involve different positions in relation to governments' use of AI and depend on particular actors and types of public service. Commonly, they concern government objectives to tackle critical societal issues through AI, such as in the areas of health and social care and employment. In particular, the discourse of enhanced administrative practices commonly positioned AI as a tool to optimize internal processes, resource allocation, and organizational management. On the other hand, the discourse of improved service delivery similarly placed public services front and center, while the discourse of empowerment through information framed AI as being able to enhance citizens' service experiences. Interestingly, discourses emphasizing the policymaking function, i.e., AI applied to the development of public policy,—receives limited attention. Our findings underscore strategic prioritizations. While efficiency and service delivery dominate the discourse, citizen engagement remains underemphasized. We argue that policymakers must strike a balance, ensuring AI aligns with broader societal outcomes while addressing democratic imperatives. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Discourse analysis; E-government; National strategy; Public value; Strategy; Technology application",""

Building on an inventory of 100 municipal websites and interviews with 20 municipal officials, we assessed the prevalence of 20 digital services, associations between municipality characteristics and digital services, and factors that spur changes in digital services. We discovered that many rural communities use digital platforms, and provide digital information, digital transactions and opportunities for digital democracy. While we found positive associations between greater levels of digital services, larger community populations, and more representative forms of government, we learned that a range of technological and cultural barriers also determine the degree to which a municipality engages with and adapts their digital services.

This study explores the opportunities and risks of using language-generating AI systems in politics to increase legislative responsiveness. Legislators receive a large volume of constituent communication and often cannot devote individual consideration and timely response to each. Here, AI language technologies may allow legislators to process constituent communication more efficiently. For example, AI writing tools can suggest reply snippets when a staffer responds to a common concern. However, legislative human-AI collaboration could reduce constituent trust or undermine the representative process. In two experiments, we compared constituents' impressions of human-written legislative correspondence to correspondences partially or fully generated by GPT-3, a state-of-the-art language model. Our results suggest that legislative correspondence generated by AI with human oversight may be received favorably and increase constituent trust compared to generic auto-responses that busy legislators may employ. However, poorly performing AI language technologies may damage confidence in the legislator.

The extended UMEGA model is empirically validated with 452 valid Indian healthcare consumers' responses. The findings reported that performance expectancy, perceived severity, effort expectancy, and perceived risk significantly influenced Indian healthcare consumers' attitudes towards EGTMS. Further political trust showed significant influence over social influence. However, social influence is observed as non-significant. Furthermore, attitude, political trust and facilitating conditions significantly influenced individuals' behavioral intentions towards EGTMS and observed significant influence of self-efficacy on effort expectancy. This is the first study that reveals the critical factors of Indian healthcare consumers' behavioral intention towards EGTMS. With the upsurge in e-government healthcare services, the outcomes of the study will benefit stakeholders such as governmental agencies, marketers, public administrators, and healthcare professionals as they provide suitable strategic recommendations to design and implement e-government telemedicine services. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Adoption; COVID-19; eSanjeevani; Health service; Healthcare; Intention; Telemedicine; UMEGA; Virtual consultation",""

Recent e-government literature indicates that what exactly constitutes public value in digital government is still debated. Whereas previous research acknowledges aspects such as co-production and the orchestration role of government in the context of public value creation, there is only a limited understanding of how public value is created by the interactions between government and business actors, and the role digital technologies play in that process. Furthermore, so far, research into public value creation processes is limited to specific services that aim to meet a specific goal; for a more complete view, an integrative perspective is required to address the multiplicity of goals. Societal challenges including climate change, sustainability, and the transition towards circularity will require governments to play a crucial role. Businesses are also transforming their vision by adding societal goals to their economic objectives and contributing to these societal challenges. This necessitates even more the need to explicitly consider the role of business in public value creation processes. In this paper we argue that there is a need to understand public value creation as an interactive process, involving both government and business actors. In this process, voluntary information sharing enabled by digital infrastructures has the potential to contribute to the value creation processes, but the increased complexity of digital technologies obscures the effects they can have on value creation. Therefore, we develop a framework that allows to reason about public value creation as an interactive process, involving government and businesses, facilitated by voluntary information sharing. The framework also allows to reason about how the technological design choices of the underlying digital infrastructure influence this value creation process. For the framework development, we use an in-depth case study from the domain of international trade. We analyze the interactions between customs authorities and supply chain actors for jointly creating public value related to revenue collection, as well as safety and security of goods entering the European Union, using business data made available via a global blockchain-enabled infrastructure. In future research, the framework that we developed can be used to analyze more complex cases with additional public value aspects, such as sustainability and circularity. © 2022 The Authors","Blockchain; Business-government; Framework; Interactive perspective; International trade; Public value creation; Supply chains; Voluntary data sharing",""

This has recently triggered a new phenomenon of privacy fatigue in e-governance, which makes people feel powerless to protect their privacy. A comprehensive understanding of users' privacy fatigue is important, since negative user perceptions may lead to disengagement and the distrust of the government. Drawing on the Person-Environment fit theory and user agency perspective, this study examines the antecedents of privacy fatigue, manifested as emotional exhaustion and cynicism. A large-scale telephone survey allowed data to be collected from 3, 436 users of facial recognition-based m-Gov services in China. The Partial Least Squares (PLS) results reveal that: (1) privacy fatigue indeed occurs among the users of facial recognition-based m-Gov services in China; (2) the perceptions of privacy control is the core antecedent of users' privacy fatigue, which influences two dimension—emotional exhaustion and cynicism—in different directions; (3) the effectiveness of both privacy self-efficacy and government legislation positively influences perceived privacy control, while the effect of the effectiveness of privacy policies on it is insignificant. This study contributes to the research by empirically testing the notion and antecedents of privacy fatigue in the context of facial recognition-based m-Gov services, and provides a mechanism analysis with an overarching theoretical framework.

This impact may also be moderated by the specific media in which the communication takes place.

The information—topics, policies and issues—remain largely consistent across administrations and media channels, but notable distinctions are observed that point to the political ideologies of administrators in office, including a restriction of relevant scientific information on climate change during the misaligned administrator. Moreover, results show differences across media types which may reflect speed and popularity affordances of Twitter compared to website communication.

However, it is not clear to what extent artificial intelligence can improve decision-making, and some policy domains have not been the focus of most recent studies, including the public budget process. More specifically, budget allocation is one of the areas in which AI may have greatest potential. Therefore, this study attempts to contribute to this gap in our existing knowledge by answering the following research question: To what extent can artificial intelligence techniques help distribute public spending to increase GDP, decrease inflation and reduce the Gini index? In order to respond to this question, this article proposes an algorithmic approach on how budget inputs (specific expenditures) are processed to generate certain outputs (economic, political, and social outcomes). The authors use the multilayer perceptron and a multiobjective genetic algorithm to analyze World Bank Open Data from 1960 to 2019, including 217 countries. The advantages of implementing this type of decision support system in public expenditures allocation arise from the ability to process large amounts of data and to find patterns that are not easy to detect, which include multiple non-linear relationships. Some technical aspects of the expenditure allocation process could be improved with the help of these kinds of techniques. In addition, the results of the AI-based approach are consistent with the findings of the scientific literature on public budgets, using traditional statistical techniques. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Budget intelligent machine; E-budgeting; Multilayer perceptron; Multiobjective genetic algorithm; Public budgeting; Smart budgeting; Smartness",""

However, the success rate in terms of acceptance and use of these apps was reportedly low. Using information gathered from citizens across four European countries and the United States of America, this study explores the role of national culture in relation to the acceptance of these apps. Using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM), an analysis was undertaken of 3595 records from a cross-country survey dataset that is in the public domain and can be obtained from the Centre for Open Science (Study 1). This analysis was followed by another survey comprising 910 respondents (Study 2). The research model was then validated by using a qualitative approach and undertaking interviews with 51 participants from four countries (Study 3). The results confirmed the moderating role of national culture on the acceptability of the contact-tracing apps in relation to power-distance, masculinity, individualism, long-term orientation and indulgence in the pre-deployment phase (Study 1). There were, however, no significant differences in acceptability of the apps between countries in relation to uncertainty avoidance; and none of the hypotheses in Study 2 was supported. The study concludes that national culture is significant in terms of the acceptance of COVID-19 apps only during the pre-deployment phase; therefore attention is required with pertinence to pre-deployment strategies.

Digitalizing the government has led to the development of numerous IT systems which must be maintained to prevent decay, standstill, additional costs, and a decline in software quality. Previous studies on TD have primarily focused on the private sector, while TD in the public sector has largely been ignored. Therefore, this case study investigated TD management in relation to two IT systems in a Danish agency. Through participant observations and in-situ interviews we studied actual TD behavior, while stakeholder theory combined with a categorization of TD types and activities served as our theoretical lens. Thus, our study (1) identifies the stakeholders influencing an agency's TD management, (2) maps stakeholders' actions, and (3) identifies stakeholders' influence on TD. We found that TD extends beyond the influence of software developers and is also influenced by the behavior of several non-technical stakeholders, e.g., the European Parliament.

Recent years have seen large discrepancies between polls and outcomes at several major elections and referendums, stemming from decreased participation in polls and an increasingly volatile electorate. This calls for new ways to measure public support for political parties. In this paper, we propose a method for measuring the popularity of election candidates on social media using Machine Learning-based Natural Language Processing techniques. The method is based on detecting voting intentions in the data. This is a considerable advance upon earlier work using automatic sentiment analysis. We evaluate the method both intrinsically on a set of hand-labelled social media posts, and extrinsically – by forecasting daily election polls. In the extrinsic evaluation, we analyze data from the 2016 US presidential election, and find that voting intentions measured from social media provide significant additional predictive value for forecasting daily polls. Thus, we demonstrate that the proposed method can be used to interpolate polls both spatially and temporally, thus providing reliable, continuous and fine-grained information about public opinion on current political issues. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Behavioural intentions; Forecasting; LSTMs; Machine learning; Neural networks; NLP; Political polls; Social media",""

Using a data quality measurement approach combined with risk management, both defined in ISO standards, we focus on balance characteristics and we aim to understand how balance indexes (Gini, Simpson, Shannon, Imbalance Ratio) identify discrimination risk in six large datasets containing the classification output of ADM systems. The best result is achieved using the Imbalance Ratio index. Gini and Shannon indexes tend to assume high values and for this reason they have modest results in both aspects: further experimentation with different thresholds is needed. In terms of policies, the risk-based approach is a core element of the EU approach to regulate algorithmic systems: in this context, balance measures can be easily assumed as risk indicators of propagation – or even amplification – of bias in the input data of ADM systems. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Algorithm fairness; Automated decision making; Data bias; Data ethics; Data quality; Digital governance; Digital policy",""

This raises the question whether a human-like design affects the ethicalness evaluation of a robot's actions. In a laboratory experiment with eye-tracking (n1 = 156) and a representative, online vignette experiment (n2 = 1339), we find that a more human-like robot design draws more visual attention than a robot with a less human-like design.

These principles help in making design decisions by which government platform owners use different boundary resources to address the three paradoxes.

It uses the nested model of PAC to reflect on systemic, organizational, and individual capacity-building from a neoinstitutional perspective and allow for the consideration of embedded institutional contexts. Results from semi-structured interviews indicate that governments seeking to exploit BDAS in policymaking depend on their institutional environment (e.g., through research and data governance infrastructure). However, specific capacity-building strategies may differ according to the departments' institutional framework, with the FMoD relying heavily on subordinate agencies and the FFO creating network-like structures with external researchers. Government capacity-building at the individual and organizational level is similarly affected by long-established institutional structures, roles, and practices within the organization and beyond, making it important to analyze these three levels simultaneously instead of separately. © 2022 The Author","Artificial intelligence (AI); Big data algorithm system (BDAS); Central government organizations; Early crisis detection; Neo-institutionalism; Policy analytical capacity (PAC); Policymaking",""

The adoption intention is conceptualized as a rationalistic, goal-directed decision that is driven by multiple strategic intents but tempered by transaction costs. Three strategic intents (accessing complementary knowledge, enhancing organizational legitimacy, and reducing innovation costs) and two transaction costs (codification costs, and broadcasting costs) are hypothesized as antecedents to the adoption intention. Data (n = 205) from municipalities in Belgium and the Netherlands shows that the adoption intention can be explained by the influence of the political executive, the pursuit of organizational legitimacy, and transaction costs associated with broadcasting.

Services were evaluated from eight perspectives: accessibility; awareness; access and repair; accountability; explanation; origin of data, privacy and fairness; auditing; validation, accuracy and testing. Adopting a qualitative approach through comparative case studies, this research contributes to information practices theory (construction of a model for assessing transparency and accountability in digital public services). The results obtained show the need to inform the user of possible bias and damage arising from these systems, which are not readily perceived; just as the need to clarify the benefits that arise from the collection of private data are not. This shows that computational models can be distorted as a result of biases contained in their input data, or algorithms.

The article combines an exploratory survey (n = 201) with semi-structured interviews of training providers (n = 19) and draws on public management concepts of metagovernance and governance networks to explain and contextualise the program's model of implementation. It explains how policy makers and community-based organisations can successfully address the digital literacy needs and interests of older adults through a metagovernance model.

This study shines light on the question of what drives public opinion regarding FRT in different socio-political contexts. Based on an online survey and semi-structured interviews, this study finds that citizens in China, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States differ in their acceptance of the official public use of FRT. China has the highest approval rates, Germany and the US have the lowest, and the UK lies in the middle. Our results show that people are generally more willing to accept FRT in public spheres when they trust government institutions, believe the technology should be managed by the central government, and have an affinity for technology. People's awareness of a country's previous history of surveillance further shapes their perceptions of FRT. Across all four countries, we also show that privacy concerns, especially of FRT compromising one's privacy, have the biggest influence on respondents' attitudes. Expanding on existing research into FRT acceptance and usage, our results suggest that policymakers urgently need to address the current regulatory vacuum. © 2022 The Authors","China; Facial recognition technology; Germany; Privacy; Public opinion; Surveillance history; UK; US",""

Adequate regulation is key to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks stemming from AI technologies. Developing regulatory frameworks is, however, challenging due to AI's global reach, agency problems present in regulation, and the existence of widespread misconceptions about the very notion of regulation. This paper makes three claims: (1) Based on interdisciplinary insights, we show that AI-related challenges cannot be tackled effectively without sincere international coordination supported by robust, consistent domestic, regional, and international governance arrangements. (2) Against this backdrop, we propose the establishment of an international AI governance framework to spearhead initiatives to create a consistent, global enabling regulatory environment, which is necessary for the successful and responsible adoption of AI technologies. To facilitate the practical implementation of our recommendation, we provide a simplified impact assessment on regulatory architecture and governance design options, appropriate to the scope of the paper.

However, previous research on the adoption of digital public services has predominantly focused on simple, or even hypothetical, services and situations. We identify a knowledge gap concerning citizens' experience of actual interactions with digital self-service for more complicated social services and benefits. Therefore, we explore digital self-service from the perspective of citizens using the concept of administrative burden as a theoretical lens. Specifically, we analyze data from in-depth empirical studies encompassing observations, interviews, and focus group discussions with single mothers who have applied for public benefits following divorce or family separation. We present a descriptive process model for citizens' application for public benefits. Next, we illustrate how digital self-service influences citizens' administrative burden throughout this process. An important contribution reveals that citizens' administrative burden increases—they must learn how to complete tasks that professional caseworkers previously conducted and comply with government demands concerning digital self-service applications and specific data formats. However, digital self-service can also reduce citizens' administrative burden through the online provision of information and automatic data transfers. Further, digital self-service offers an anonymous application process that may reduce the psychological costs and stigma associated with receiving public benefits.

First, we answer the research question: How much euro efficiency is gained in public service delivery by €1 increase in share of IT costs relative to total municipal costs? Second, we focus on contextual effects of these efficiency gains, by analyzing the effects of workforce mean age, workforce age dispersion and training costs. We use data from Dutch municipalities and study these efficiency gains in the period 2014–2018. Our empirical strategy encompasses a two-step procedure combining a stochastic frontier model and ordinary least squares models. Our analysis suggests that share of IT costs relative to total municipal costs (in short: share of IT costs) can explain efficiency in public service delivery by municipalities. Our results indicate that an increase of €1 in favour of share of IT costs leads to a net cost efficiency gain of €1.08. We also show that this effect in efficiency gains diminishes with a higher share of IT costs.

Russia serves as a case study to explore the extent to which it possible to use platforms for intergovernmental management - to effectively integrate all regions on a single platform, despite wide differences in capabilities and needs. We examine the case of Gosuslugi.ru through the technology enactment framework (Fountain, 2001). While the literature on platforms emphasizes loose coordination or orchestration, the technology enactment framework suggests that in systems with a high degree of centralization, such as Russia, platforms will be more centralized and top-down. We show the problems a highly centralized approach creates for implementation in the context of wide disparities, but the modularity and adaptability of platforms may also allow for more decentralization through choice and varied levels of participation. An open question is whether such flexibility will be allowed going forward. The technology enactment framework has been used primarily to analyze microlevel behavior within organizations.

Yet, the use of AI in public organizations in still lagging significantly compared to private organizations. Prior literature looking into aspects that facilitate adoption and use of AI has concentrated on challenges concerning technical aspects of AI technologies, providing little insight regarding the organizational deployment of AI, particularly in public organizations. Building on this gap, this study seeks to examine what aspects enable public organizations to develop AI capabilities. To answer this question, we built an integrated and extended model from the Technology-Organization-Environment framework (TOE) and asked high-level technology managers from municipalities in Europe about factors that influence their development of AI capabilities. We collected data from 91 municipalities from three European countries (i.e., Germany, Norway, and Finland) and analyzed responses by means of structural equation modeling. Our findings indicate that five factors – i.e. perceived financial costs, organizational innovativeness, perceived governmental pressure, government incentives, regulatory support – have an impact on the development of AI capabilities. We also find that perceived citizen pressure and perceived value of AI solutions are not important determinants of AI capability formation. Our findings bear the potential to stimulate a more reflected adoption of AI supporting managers in public organizations to develop AI capabilities. © 2021 The Author(s)","AI capabilities; Artificial intelligence; Public organizations; TOE framework",""

To accomplish this objective, we systematically tracked every post published by the official Facebook page of 304 Portuguese municipalities between March 2 and July 5, 2020. The findings show that financial autonomy is the main predictor of e-disclosure, factors varied on the different phases of the pandemic's first wave, and sociodemographic factors became more prevalent as explanatory factors when the crisis worsened. Our study may help increase the level of preparedness during possible future crises. In particular, establishing communication strategies for prolonged public health crises, making financial resources available for the accomplishment of such strategies, and reducing the digital divide can contribute to more effective disclosure. Future research should explore the dynamics of disclosure during public health crises. This study also highlights the need to incorporate time in research that focuses on the determinants of e-disclosure that could also be tested in normal times. © 2021","COVID-19; E-disclosure; Facebook; Health crisis management; Municipalities; Social media",""

Cluster analyses reveal that the municipalities are rather heterogeneous in managing FOI publicity. Some of them provide full disclosure of relevant information; instead, others show non-compliance with the guidelines issued by the Italian central government. Regression analyses suggest that municipalities' size and income positively correlate with more elevated publicity.

Previous authors have stated that social media institutionalization encompasses a process including stages from experimentation to complete command of the innovation. However, an understanding of barriers to social media institutionalization in public administration needs to be developed. In this article we focus on exploring what factors operate as barriers of the social media institutionalization process. Methodologically, we use a mixed-methods strategy combining different sources of data for triangulation purposes, including a survey on social media conducted to Spanish largest local governments. Based on this data, and following the literature on social media institutionalization, we construct a Social Media Institutionalization Index (SMI). Our SMI is founded on a set of variables measuring to what extent social media have been embedded in public sector organizations. Also, we conducted a case study in a city council based on semi-structured interviews. Our results suggest that social media institutionalization has not been fully developed in our sample of local governments. In addition, different variables (including security, lack of resources for maintenance, control and evaluation, organizational culture, or absence of governance framework) are perceived by public managers as institutionalization barriers, whereas the governance scheme of social media seems to be the critical variable. At the same time, we emphasize that some inhibitors might be overvalued by public employees. This article encourages future avenues of comparative research and practical recommendations to public managers leading social media in the public sector. © 2021 The Author(s)","Barriers; Inhibitors; Institutionalization; Local government; Social media; Spain",""

The proposed framework integrates the decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the Theory of Reasoned Goal Pursuit, and Stakeholder Theory. Many participants reported a low level of involvement in broadband infrastructure initiatives even though supporting infrastructure development to promote economic growth is one of the Regional Planning Commissions' primary goals. Regional Planning Commissions are highly influenced by four primary stakeholder groups, (1) residents and businesses, (2) local governments, (3) internet service providers, and (4) state and federal government, which vary in terms of priorities and power. While defining the region's priorities with elected officials, Regional Planning Commissions often “push them forward” to recognize the necessity of broadband infrastructure. However, Regional Planning Commissions also struggle with low self-efficacy and inadequate expertise to support broadband planning efforts. The proposed framework could be generalized to understand actions and decisions by other intergovernmental organizations that have convening power and face similar power dynamics with their stakeholders. © 2022 The Authors","Broadband planning; Intergovernmental organizations; Stakeholder theory; Theory of planned behavior; Theory of reasoned goal pursuit",""

Results show that agency FRT use contributes to greater racial disparity in arrests. This relationship was underpinned by statistically meaningful and positive FRT effects on Black arrest rates and negative effects on White rates. We also observed more sizeable and significant impacts for adult arrests, indicating that FRT's association with adult rates primarily drives the overall disparity finding. Results suggest a need for civic leaders to scrutinize the relative contributions of structural factors, agency policies, and government directives to officer decision-making before widely deploying FRT in jurisdictions.

Wickedness means that the facts that define a problem are ambiguous and that there is no consensus on the normative criteria for solving this problem. In such a situation, the use of algorithms can result in distrust. Whereas there is much research advancing XAI technology, the focus of this paper is on strategies for explainability. Three illustrative cases are used to show that explainable, data-driven decisions are often not perceived as objective by the public. The context might raise strong incentives to contest and distrust the explanation of AI, and as a consequence, fierce resistance from society is encountered. To overcome the inherent problems of XAI, decisions-specific strategies are proposed to lead to societal acceptance of AI-based decisions.

In the past, each agency organized its own data exchange system according to its own needs. Today, data is distributed over many organizations, and government agencies need to adopt an ecosystem approach for data exchange. Fundamental in the ecosystem approach is the dependence on other parties for the execution of stewardship strategies. Data-driven government agencies increasingly depend on other organizations for high-quality data and data stewardship across organizations is becoming more critical. While there is ample research on data stewardship within organizations, little is known about data stewardship in ecosystems. More specifically, it is unclear which data stewardship strategies government agencies can employ in ecosystems. The main goal of this explorative paper is to identify and compare data stewardship strategies used in empirical government-business ecosystems. Following an explorative case study approach, this paper reveals three different configurations of inter-organizational data stewardship: 1) the government-led ecosystem, 2) the government-business-led ecosystem, and 3) the regulation-led ecosystem. The case studies expose a wide array of data stewardship strategies across ecosystems. While the ecosystem approach provides advantages such as cost-sharing and innovation by private parties, government agencies become increasingly dependent on private parties to gain high-quality data and provide distributed infrastructure components. Maximizing the benefits and minimizing the risks of the ecosystem approach requires government agencies to be cautious when selecting a specific ecosystem configuration. © 2021","Data exchange; Data stewardship; Digital transformation; Governance; Government-business data ecosystems; Information quality; Interdependence; System quality",""

We found support for four theoretical mechanisms. First, our findings support the existence of demand-pull innovation in the public sector: public organizations respond to citizen demands or needs for innovation. Second, we also find support for an electoral incentive hypothesis, which posits that local governments' motivation for digital innovation is influenced by local politicians' electoral incentives. Third, our results show the existence of isomorphic pressure as a driver for public sector innovation: public organizations emulate their neighbors in adopting innovative practices. Fourth, the results support the upper echelons theory, as younger policymakers are more active innovators. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Digital innovation; Electoral competitiveness; Public sector innovation; Upper echelons theory",""

The latter is measured as observable online behavioral responses to police tweets in form of likes, comments, and retweets. The results suggest that emotional arousal (i.e. the emotional intensity of a tweet) plays a key role in triggering all forms of citizen engagement, while emotional valence (more specifically, the negativity of a tweet) largely shows no effect. Moreover, the impact of content type (informative versus interactive) varies across the different engagement dimensions. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Emotional arousal; Emotional valence; Engagement; Mixed emotions; Police; Social media",""

This research article aims to critically explore the ways in which the legal information needs of different groups of actors within society translate into enhanced interactions with a sophisticated legal information retrieval system, and result in effective data-driven decision making for better governance. To do so, five user stories outlining the various ways in which five archetypal users of an advanced legal information system may interact with a document-driven platform, and use its functionalities to take key decisions pertaining to their everyday personal and professional lives, are presented and critically examined.

Therefore, this study proposes a multi-perspective approach where an OGD portal is analyzed from (1) citizens' perspective, (2) users' perspective, (3) experts' perspective, and (4) state of the art. By considering these perspectives, we can define how to improve the portal in question by focusing on its demand side.

A range of policy instruments can be used by municipal policy makers to encourage citizens to engage in environmentally responsible behaviours. Information and communications technology (ICT) is an important lever for changing individuals' behaviours and thus is increasingly found among the policy approaches adopted by cities. This research focuses on cities' use of ICT-enabled persuasion. Combining the unimodel of persuasion with the persuasive system design framework, the research develops and tests a theoretical model explaining how dimensions of the user context (green identity, goal intention) and technology context (integration support) influence the persuasiveness of city-sponsored applications with respect to environmentally responsible behaviours performed in the home and community. A survey of 203 individuals in North America shows that goal intention and integration support provided by the applications significantly influence perceived persuasion effectiveness for environmentally responsible behaviours at home. For environmentally responsible behaviours in the community, all three independent variables have a positive influence on the perceived persuasion effectiveness. The research extends the digital government literature by investigating an emerging policy intervention and providing a novel theoretical explanation of how elements within an ICT-enabled persuasion event come together to affect individuals' behaviours. Furthermore, the research provides municipal policy makers with new insights into how to design an ICT-enabled policy instrument for encouraging greater environmental citizenship. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Environmentally responsible behaviours; Goal intention; Green identity; Integration support; Persuasive system design; Sustainability; Unimodel",""

This research examines which factors influence how much long-standing and temporal attention social media accounts of EU agencies receive. Using an extensive Twitter dataset of EU agencies and a new methodology that employs supervised text classification through the novel BERT language model to classify agency tweets, possible explanations of social media attention are tested. Results show that long-standing social media attention (i.e., size of the followership) is mostly explained by salience in traditional news, account age, and tweeting frequency, whilst a more interactive communication style tends to yield more temporal attention (i.e., number of retweets).

The diffusion rates of various types of e-government services are measured and analyzed over two decades. E-government surveys conducted by the International City/County Management Association (ICMA) from 2000 to 2011 provide an early trendline of e-government services offered, and an original two-wave panel survey was conducted in 2014 and 2019 collecting data, which extends this timeline and offers new ways to measure adoption in this later period. The panel survey includes the same 83 cities randomly selected from all cities with populations over 50,000, representing over 10% of medium and large size cities in the U.S. The findings of this study provide a clear picture that cities across the nation have increasingly adopted a wide set of e-gov services, with some reaching near complete diffusion. A total of 45 different e-government services are evaluated, with similar e-government services organized together into informational, interactive, multimedia, financial, and social media scaled variables for further analysis. Adoption and diffusion of e-government services have been neither steady nor uniform. However, from 2014 to 2019 the trend was clear: more cities offered more e-government services more consistently. The findings also offer insights into the characteristics of cities that have adopted e-government innovations earlier than others. Both greater population size and percent of residents with broadband access contribute in a statistically significant way to the number of e-gov services adopted, while other expected independent variables like economic measures of wealth do not.

The literature considers the presence of healthy ecosystems as crucial for effective use of OGD, with positive effects on democracy, policy effectiveness, and economic development. This paper employs the Exponential Random Graph model (ERGM) technique to empirically explore relations among the actors of an OGD ecosystem for public participation in the context of the European Policy in Italy. The models estimate the likelihood of an ecosystem connection between actors as documented online via Twitter, by considering the type of actor - namely government organizations, user communities, NGOs and the media - and their locations. The analysis showed that governmental organizations as data providers and intermediaries play a crucial role in disseminating OGD and facilitating their use by local communities. Government organizations as policy makers were much less active. In addition, NGOs and the media were less disposed than government actors to serve as data intermediaries and less likely than local communities to engage in policy deliberation. These patterns suggest that the nature and level of engagement by various actors may be influenced by their interest in the specific purpose of the ecosystem. Finally, co-location is a powerful predictor of the creation of new connections among actors of all kinds, demonstrating that effective local data use can be enabled and encouraged by national data provision. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Civic engagement; ERGM; Open data intermediaries; Open government data; Open government data ecosystem; Social network analysis",""

The content analysis points to the applicability of sentiment analysis for citizens' engagement to solve social problems like traffic congestion, crime prediction, disaster management, etc. According to the strategic map, information retrieval and supervised learning are the motor themes; sentiment analysis and ubiquitous computing are the basic themes, while semantics and recommender systems are the niche themes. Thematic analysis of intellectual structure indicates sentiment analysis applications for smart governance, smart mobility, smart infrastructure, and smart living as the building blocks for smart societies. Based on a comprehensive review, future research directions and managerial implications are provided. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Analytics; Sentiment analysis; Smart city; Smart society; Social computing; Social media",""

Combining the novel technique of structural topic modeling (STM) and qualitative narrative analysis, this paper examines the policy narratives in 33 countries’ AI policies. We uncover six common narratives that are dominating the political agenda concerning AI. Our findings show that the policy narratives' saliences vary across time and countries. We make several contributions. First, our narratives describe well-grounded, supportable conceptions of AI among governments, and show that AI is still a fairly novel, multilayered, and controversial phenomenon. Building on the premise that human sensemaking is best represented and supported by narration, we address the applied rhetoric of governments to either minimize the risks or exalt the opportunities of AI. Second, we uncover the four prominent roles governments seek to take concerning AI implementation: enabler, leader, regulator, and/or user. Third, we make a methodological contribution toward data-driven, computationally-intensive theory development. Our methodological approach and the identified narratives present key starting points for further research. © 2022 The Authors","Artificial intelligence (AI); Narrative policy framework (NPF); Policy research; Role of government; Structural topic modeling (STM)",""

This has sometimes been done with the aim of reducing costs and human errors by improving data analysis and management, but not without raising major technological challenges. One of these challenges is certainly the need to cope with relatively small amounts of data, without sacrificing performance. Indeed, cutting-edge approaches to (natural) language processing and understanding are often data-hungry, especially those based on deep learning. With this paper we seek to address the problem of data scarcity in automatic Legalese (or legal English) processing and understanding. What we propose is an ensemble of shallow and deep learning techniques called SyntagmTuner, designed to combine the accuracy of deep learning with the ability of shallow learning to work with little data. Our contribution is based on the assumption that Legalese differs from its spoken language in the way the meaning is encoded by the structure of the text and the co-occurrence of words. As result, we show with SyntagmTuner how we can perform important tasks for e-governance, as multi-label classification of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolutions or legal question answering, with data-sets of roughly 100 samples or even less. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Data scarcity; Deep learning; Law; Syntagmatic relations; TF-IDF",""

This study explores how the perception of government employees shapes the willingness to support the use of AI technologies in government. Based on a survey data on current government employees in the U.S., our analysis reveals that the willingness to implement and use AI technologies in government was contingent upon a series of positive and negative perceptions about the new technologies, long-term outlook on the role of AI technologies in society, and the familiarity and experience in using some form of AI applications in the past. In particular, the perception of AI enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the work and a positive and longer-term outlook on AI's future about human labor (as an assistant or a competitor), the perception of the technology's ultimate harm or benefit (does it harm or benefit humanity), its ability to eventually make ethical and moral judgments influenced the willingness to support AI technologies in government. A substantial proportion of the government employees in the survey sample responded that they had experienced using some form of AI applications in their work and this familiarity had a strong positive influence on their support for AI. Our findings point to the importance of training the government employees in AI technologies to improve their understanding and perception about the new technologies as well as their potentials in government that will foster a culture of innovation toward sustainable and impactful digital transformation. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Adoption; Artificial intelligence; Frontier technology; Perception",""

However, it is not clear which features and functionalities police forces and citizens require for engagement through such platforms. We approached this question from a technological frames perspective and adopted a mixed-method design involving 133 participants from police forces and local communities in six countries. We identified three distinct sub-groups among police and community users: high-need users, complacent users and sceptics, as characterized by group-specific expectations and requirements. We offer two main contributions from our study. First, we propose a novel typology of technological frames in the context of online CP and provide design recommendations to accommodate divergent requirements that exist within and across police forces and citizen groups. In doing so we illustrate the importance of going beyond presupposed user groups, in our case the police-community dichotomy, to design for online engagement. Second, we contribute to the study of structural understandings of technological frames by demonstrating a sequential mixed-method approach that is transferable to other online engagement contexts.

Interoperability further enables information and usable data to be properly exchanged and ensures the alignment of different business processes in critical sectors. In addition, is a prerequisite for transparent, domain-agnostic, and sustainable public sector digital services, where Public Administrations (PA) can efficiently interact across borders and domains by using common frameworks, standards, and processes for sharing information and data. The European Interoperability Framework (EIF) enables interoperability with guidelines for digital services. Therefore, the alignment with EIF becomes pivotal for the European Union (EU) countries since different regulations that facilitate and impose the implementation of European policies such as the Single Digital Gateway (SDG) regulation and the Once-Only Principle (OOP) consider the IOP a crucial technical and operational component for government digital services.

For this reason, OGD administrators provide metadata publishing guidelines to request, among other things, that certain metadata field always be present (completeness) and that field validation rules, when provided, be met (consistency). Lack of compliance of OGD metadata with publishing guidelines in country portals constitutes poor metadata quality control and will drastically decrease the effective use/reuse of the data and keep the expected benefits from being realized. This study explores the extent of metadata compliance, in terms of completeness and consistency, of three OGD leading country portals (Canada, USA, New Zealand) with respect to their own metadata publishing guidelines. A statistical comparison of population proportions among the countries was performed. The results indicate that the compliance of the USA is far less than Canada and New Zealand in terms of datasets with required fields set (completeness). On the other hand, New Zealand trails Canada and the USA in terms of OGD datasets with valid (consistent) fields. These results indicate that OGD metadata compliance is rather poor, suggesting insufficient quality control.

While most studies of digitalisation of the public sector have focused on the practical outcomes for the quality of public services and the quality of public administration work, none have unpacked, or theorised, how these changes actually come about in practice. This paper fills this gap by drawing on a study of the in-house adaptation of a digital automation tool (an RPA) by a Swedish local authority. In the article, we pay attention to what we, inspired by Donna Haraway and Lucy Suchman, call ‘configuring work’, i.e. the weaving together of the affordances of the technology, materials, discourses, roles and power structures. The contribution of the paper is two-fold. First, the paper demonstrates empirically how the digitalisation of a public service took place through an emergent, relational process that involved both the social and the material. Second, by adopting the the idea of ‘configuring work’ and paying attention to the effects of this, we show that the digitalisation process was successively shaped by the particular vested interests, ethics, discourses and the algorithmic materialities that comprised it. This helps us discuss the reason for why, in extant literature, digitalisation threatens the professional autonomy of the public administrators as well as why it may reduce service quality. Finally, we suggest how some of these issues may be addressed in future research. © 2021 The Authors","Algorithmisation; Automating; Automation; Configuring work; Digitalisation; Public administration work; Robot process automation; RPA; Social work",""

In this research, we employed a case study approach to investigate and analyze DT based on relevant events occurring in a five-year period. A conceptual model was created by combining the diamond framework, the technology enactment framework, and enterprise architecture scope to facilitate the chronological analysis of these events and reflect upon the creation of flexibility. The findings indicate that DT in government spreads in waves with adaptations in different organizational elements, impacting the whole administrative system from the provincial level to the country level and including both radical and incremental changes. Flexibility increases alongside progress in DT and can be technology-enabled or policy-enabled. The creation of flexibility also depends on organizational elements and bureaucratic levels. This study advocates a cross-level view to comprehensively understand DT and offers insights to help other governments craft DT agenda. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Cloud infrastructure; Digital government; Digital transformation; Enterprise architecture; Flexibility; Public services",""

Open approaches to public sector innovation that exploits digital technologies have been proposed for some years to close this gap, but our knowledge of the use and outcome of using open innovation in this context is limited. This research takes stock of the study and use of these approaches by investigating the purposes for which public sector organisations use open innovation, and how it creates value. The research question is answered through a systematic literature review and an analysis of publicly available data about the open innovation projects referred to in that literature. The research identifies five different purposes of using open innovation. It also suggests that public sector organisations primarily use open innovation to pursue one specific purpose: innovation in society. When using open innovation for this purpose, public sector organisations attempt to create value by improving citizens' quality of life and the quality of neighbourhoods. They do this primarily by co-specialising IT and other resources in society (e.g. the transportation system) and by using the outcome of this co-specialisation process to change citizen behaviour, capabilities and experiences (e.g. encouraging citizens to use the transportation system more efficiently or making citizens feel more safe when using the transportation system). This research indicates that open innovation is generally not used to open up public sector organisations or to give citizens more influence in public sector or democratic processes. The research also indicates that open innovation, until now, has primarily been used to solve minor problems, and not large scale wicked problems in society. The research suggests a framework for value creation from open innovation initiatives that pursues innovation in society. This framework might help public sector organisations increase value creation and solve wicked problems using open innovation, and might help researchers to focus future open innovation research on essential knowledge gaps. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Citizen sourcing; Crowdsourcing; Open innovation; Value creation",""

Accordingly, the dissemination of data portals that implement such platforms has paved the way for automation, wherein (meta)data extraction supplies the demand for quantity-oriented metrics, mainly for benchmark purposes. This has given rise to an issue regarding how to survey data portals globally, especially reducing the manual efforts, while covering a wide variety of sources that may not implement standardized solutions. Thus, this study raises two main problems: searching for standardized open data software platforms and identifying specific developed web-based software operated as data portals. This study aims to develop a method that deeply searches each web page on the internet and formalizes a machine learning classification model to improve the identification of data portals, irrespective of how these data portals implement a standardized open data software platform and comply with the open data technical guidelines. The contributions of this work have been demonstrated through a list of 1,650 open data portals generalized in a training model that makes it feasible to distinguish between a data portal (that may or may not implement a standardized platform) and an ordinary web page.

In response, most democracies have extended voting rights to their citizens abroad. Nevertheless, expatriate voter turnout tends to be low. This article investigates a frequently proposed remedy—internet voting—based on a case study of extended internet voting trials in eight Swiss cantons. For causal identification, I exploit an unexpected federal intervention that led to a temporary suspension of internet voting in four of the eight cantons, during which expatriates could vote only by mail. Using difference-in-differences estimation, I find that the temporary suspension of internet voting decreased turnout among registered expatriate voters by 4.1 to 6.4 percentage points. Placebo tests suggest that pre- and post-suspension trends in expatriate voter turnout were close to identical in treated and control cases. Overall, the results of this study suggest that internet voting represents an effective method to increase electoral participation among citizens abroad. Still, expatriate voter turnout remained well-below domestic turnout even with internet voting available, suggesting that high voting costs are not the only reason why citizens abroad tend to vote at lower rates. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Citizens abroad; Electoral participation; Expatriates; Internet voting; Turnout",""

AI can reduce or increase information deficits of both citizens and decision-makers on the input, throughout, and output level of the political system. While the challenges that AI creates for democratic responsiveness and accountability have a novel technological dimension, they are nonetheless in continuity with existing transparency and accountability problems.

This narrative takes sociomaterial arrangements for granted and conceptualizes technology affordance - the problem-solving capability of a technology - as a standard built-in feature that automatically activates during technology deployment, leading to undiversified and predetermined collective benefits. This paper demonstrates that not everything is as it seems; implementing a technology is a necessary but insufficient condition for triggering its potential problem-solving capability. The potential affordance and effects of a technology are mediated by the sociomaterial arrangements that users assemble to connect their goals to the materiality of technological artifacts and socio-organizational context in which technology deployment takes place. To substantiate this argument and illustrate the mediating role of sociomaterial arrangements, we build on sociomateriality and technology affordance theory, and we present the results of a systematic review of Covid-19 literature in which 2187 documents are examined. The review combines text data mining, co-occurrence pattern recognition, and inductive coding, and it focuses on four digital technologies that public authorities have deployed as virus containment measures: infrared temperature-sensing devices; ICT-based surveillance and contact-tracing systems; bioinformatic tools and applications for laboratory testing; and electronic mass communications media. Reporting on our findings, we add nuances to the academic debate on sociomateriality, technology affordance, and the governance of technology in public health crises.

The Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) is the law that gives effect to section 32 of the Constitution. Regardless of a remarkable trend towards the adoption of FOI laws, international trends have shown this does not automatically translate into fulfilment of people's right to information. This study utilised mixed method research through the explanatory sequential design to assess compliance with FOI legislation by public bodies in South Africa, with a view to develop a model for implementation of FOI. The study first conducted a quantitative study by analysing the reports of the South African Human Rights Commission from the reporting years 2006/07 to 2016/07 to assess compliance with sections 14, 15, 16, 17 and 32 of the PAIA. Thereafter, a qualitative study through interviews with purposively chosen participants was conducted to substantiate the findings of a quantitative study. Key results suggest that over the years, there were problems in the implementation of the FOI legislation in South Africa and its use was limited. Where implementation has taken place, it has been partial and inconsistent. The responsibility for the implementation of FOI legislation in most public bodies is assigned to legal departments that do not have knowledge of what records are created, and where and how they are kept. With regard to compliance, in terms of the degree of comparison, the situation was better in national departments, worse in provincial departments and worst in municipalities. The study recommends the establishment of an information governance unit to implement FOI in public bodies. Failure to assign responsibility to a relevant unit would perpetuate the non-compliance with FOI legislation by public bodies in South Africa. A model for the implementation of PAIA within a public body is suggested. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Access to information; Governmental bodies; Promotion of access to information act; Public sector; Records; Right to information",""

However, they all rely on data which is not only big, open and linked but varied, dynamic and streamed at high speeds in real-time. Managing such data is challenging. To overcome such challenges and utilize opportunities for BDAS, organizations are increasingly developing advanced data governance capabilities. This paper reviews challenges and approaches to data governance for such systems, and proposes a framework for data governance for trustworthy BDAS. The framework promotes the stewardship of data, processes and algorithms, the controlled opening of data and algorithms to enable external scrutiny, trusted information sharing within and between organizations, risk-based governance, system-level controls, and data control through shared ownership and self-sovereign identities.

We study how the usage of algorithms for managerial decisions affects procedural justice as reported by public employees. We argue that some public management practices may be more suitable for algorithmic decision-making than others. We hypothesize that employees' perceptions differ depending on the complexity of the practice at hand. We test this through two survey experiments on 109 Dutch public employees and 126 public employees from the UK. Our results show that when a decision is made by an algorithm for practices that are low in complexity, procedural justice increases. Our results also show that, for practices that are high in complexity, decisions involving a public manager are perceived as higher in procedural justice compared to decisions that were made automatically by computers using algorithms. Nevertheless, adding an algorithm to a public manager's decision-making process can increase procedural justice for high complexity practices. We conclude that managers should explore automation opportunities for low complexity practices, but to be cautious when using algorithms to replace public managers' decisions for high complexity practices. In the latter case, transparency about algorithms and open dialogues on perceptions could be beneficial, but this should not be seen as a panacea. © 2020","Algorithms; Decisions; Discretion; Procedural justice; Public employees; Public managers",""

Policies on open government data (OGD) inspire the development of new and innovative services that government agencies may lack. The International Open Data Charter adequately describes the importance of data mining. Governments that have signed this charter should focus on the following areas—(i) data mining, (ii) linkage, and (iii) in-depth analysis, i.e., distribution of open data that is freely accessible for elaborate analysis using machine reading. However, a series of practical difficulties is observed in connection with the data mining of OGD for in-depth analysis. First, most OGD do not have identifiers to prevent privacy disclosure. Second, owing to the nature of siloed data, the data sharing and collection methods vary with respect to heterogeneous OGD, and administrative or institutional barriers need to be overcome. This has created a demand for a novel technical solution that applies micro-aggregation and distance-based record linkage to address the aforementioned issues. Thus, in this study, a method capable of integrating two or more de-identified OGDs into one dataset to enable OGD data mining is proposed. In addition, the proposed method allows users to adjust the privacy threshold level to determine an appropriate balance between privacy disclosure risk and data utility. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated in terms of several metrics via extensive experimentation. This study emphasizes the importance of the research on efficient utilization of already-published OGDs, which has been relatively neglected in the past. Further, it broadens the research area for privacy-preserving data mining by proposing a method capable of mining heterogeneous data even in the absence of identifiers. © 2020 The Author(s)","Heterogeneous data sources; Machine learning; Micro-aggregation; Open government data; Privacy-preserving data mining; Synthetic data; Unsupervised learning",""

The current study tries to make sense of this contrast, while examining differences between sophisticated and less sophisticated undecideds (their level of sophistication was based on their political interest and knowledge). Using two panel surveys, conducted before and after the April 2019 elections in Israel (N = 1427; N = 912), we examine a number of hypotheses about differences in terms of the undecided citizens' demographic backgrounds, how they search for political information during the election campaign, how they come to make their final decisions, and whether they ended up voting.

Taking a design science approach, this paper suggests a systematic method to assign tweets into each of the SERVQUAL dimensions to identify sentiments and track perceived service quality of healthcare services for policy makers. The method consists of (1) identifying more reliable topic sets through repeated latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and clustering; and (2) classifying tweets using topics based on an existing theory for service quality. The method is applied to tweets on the quality of NHS of the UK to demonstrate its usability. We measured social perceptions of healthcare service quality and identified keywords for each SERVQUAL dimension. Moreover, a comparison between the social perceptions derived from the tweets and traditional survey result on the same service quality shows the similarity which confirms the usability of the proposed method. The method has a practical value as a complimentary tool for the more expensive national scale surveys as well as academic value as a novel method integrating text mining with theoretically sound quality framework, SERVQUAL. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Data mining; Design science; Sentiment analysis; SERVQUAL; Social perceptions; Topic modelling",""

They may later lead to hazardous and unwanted outcomes when procuring, acquiring, or implementing the IS. To reduce unsatisfactory outcomes and fears and improve public IS procurement, we thus need to understand different concerns and their effects. In this paper, we present a qualitative single case study where different concerns emerge in the market consultation documentation of a public IS procurement. We identify and analyze the concerns by using the grounded theory approach. We then reflect them with the public IS procurement challenges and the European Union (EU) procurement legislation to understand their influence in public procurement. This provides twofold outcomes: a list of concerns and a model that illustrates their interrelations and a long impact chain within the procurement documentations. The model underlines the impacts of different concerns on IS procurement in general, and on system requirements and vendor selection in particular.

To deal with the enormous volumes of trade customs administrations rely more and more on information technology (IT) and risk assessment, and are starting to explore the possibilities that data analytics (DA) can offer to support their supervision tasks. Driven by customs as our empirical domain, we explore the use of DA to support the supervision role of government. Although data analytics is considered to be a technological breakthrough, there is so far only a limited understanding of how governments can translate this potential into actual value and what are barriers and trade-offs that need to be overcome to lead to value realisation. The main question that we explore in this paper is: How to identify the value of DA in a government supervision context, and what are barriers and trade-offs to be considered and overcome in order to realise this value? Building on leading models from the information system (IS) literature, and by using case studies from the customs domain, we developed the Value of Data Analytics in Government Supervision (VDAGS) framework. The framework can help managers and policy-makers to gain a better understanding of the benefits and trade-offs of using DA when developing DA strategies or when embarking on new DA projects. Future research can examine the applicability of the VDAGS framework in other domains of government supervision. © 2020 The Author(s)","Capabilities; Collective capability; Data analytics; eCommerce; Framework; Government; Supervision; Value",""

Drawing on channel choice literature and theories, this study aims at explaining users' reporting behavior by examining the role of users' personal factors, including digital divide determinants, users' service experience, and channel satisfaction. We use a combination of survey and log data on actual reporting behavior among smart bike-sharing users to explain users' channel choice. Using a multinomial logistic regression, we found that the digital divide predicts user-reporters' channel choice. Moreover, user-reporters with a longer service membership favor traditional and e-government channels, over the newly implemented m-government channels. Finally, user-reporters' satisfaction with the mobile application is negatively associated with the user-reporters' choice of traditional and e-government channels.

This research explores how to define a service delivery strategy that forces users to adopt digital channels. Four in-depth case studies have been conducted on Italian local governments that started delivering their non-educational school services through digital channels alone. We found that a mandatory service delivery strategy is feasible when the starting point is to understand the users' characteristics, skills and behaviours and, as a consequence, whether they perceive the service as complex and/or ambiguous. With this in mind, public organisations can select the proper mix of channels for each category of users and combine their change in approach with behavioural-type interventions, i.e. by creating the right conditions to modify the users' behaviour. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Channel choice; Digital public service; Local governments; Mandatory digital channel; Media richness theory; Multichannel management",""

We find that transitioning to a DLT-based patent records system can enable many previously suggested improvements to current patent systems in a flexible, scalable, and transparent manner. The case for such a transition is strengthened when jointly considering the complex but common roots of problems facing modern patent systems, rather than a balkanised set of technical solutions to address each issue independently.

However, media consumers usually have a hard time differentiating misinformation from authentic information. There are two explanations for this difficulty, namely lazy reasoning and motivated reasoning. While lazy reasoning suggests that people may feel reluctant to conduct critical reasoning when consuming online information, the motivated reasoning theory points out that individuals are also thinking in alignment with their identities and established viewpoints. A proposed approach to address this issue is adding fact-checking flags in the hope that flags could alert people to information falsehoods and stimulate critical thinking. This study examines the impact of fact-checking flags on media consumers' identification of fake news. Conducting an experiment (n = 717) on Amazon Mechanical Turk, the study finds that experimental participants with different political backgrounds depend heavily on flag-checking results provided by flags. Flags are powerful to influence people's judgments in a way that participants have blind beliefs in flags even if the flag assessments are inaccurate. Furthermore, the study's results indicate that flag assessments made by professional fact-checkers or crowdsourcing are equally influential in shaping participants' identification. These observations provide public and private leaders with suggestions that fact-checking flags can significantly affect media consumers' identification of fake news. However, flags appear to have little ability to promote critical thinking in this experiment. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Critical thinking; Experiment; Fact-checking; Fake news",""

While it is desirable that services are available, this can also reduce the cost to clients of seeking services.

Each of these two perspectives has its own concepts, measurements, and theoretical models. This separation becomes significant when trying to have a comprehensive understanding of digital government success and when facing practical problems since factors affecting both governments and citizens contribute to the success or failure of digital government initiatives. Therefore, this paper proposes a comprehensive digital government success model that attempts to integrate implementation and adoption perspectives.

Therefore, to enhance the body of relevant literature, this study examines the existing challenges of AI implementation in PMS of India and explores the inter-relationships among them. The study has utilized the DEMATEL method for identification of the cause-and-effect group factors. The findings reveal that poor data quality, managers' lack of understanding of cognitive technologies, data privacy, problems in integrating cognitive projects and expensive technologies are the main challenges for AI implementation in PMS of India. Moreover, a model is proposed for industrial decision-makers and managers to take appropriate decisions to develop intelligent AI enabled systems for manufacturing organizations in emerging economies. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","AI enabled systems; Artificial intelligence; Emerging economies; Implementing challenges; Public manufacturing sector",""

We seek to identify the determinants of local government use of Instagram, the determinants of activity in this channel and the determinants of citizen reactions in order to understand the influence of media types (picture, video or album) used in municipality posts, and to understand content type (what the post is about). Instaloader, an open source intelligence (OSINT) tool for Instagram, was applied. It made it possible to automatically extract all posts of the analysed municipalities (14,742 posts). These were later automatically analysed using R, an open source software. It was determined that of the 29 Andalusian local governments with the highest populations, only those that maintain an account on Instagram, totalling 17 municipalities (58.62%), would be part of the final analysis. Our findings demonstrate that when local governments have a high level of debt, they do not maintain and actively use Instagram accounts. We also found that quality of posts’ content is more important than quantity of followers, since there is no significant relationship between citizen reactions and the number of inhabitants of a municipality or the number of followers (audience), while there is a significant negative relationship between the number of posts (activity) and reactions. Our results also highlight that the level of reactions can be stimulated by certain media and content types. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Citizens Reactions; Instagram; Local Governments; Media and Content Types; Social Media",""

Towards this, we employ human-centered development perspective, the “just” environmental sustainability paradigm, agency theory, and rent-seeking theory to draw linkages between EP, Corruption Control, Inclusive Human Development, and Environmental Performance. Using publicly available archival data for 132 countries, we carry out an empirical analysis and establish that higher EP is positively associated with Inclusive Human Development and subsequently Environmental Performance. Specifically, our results substantiate the role of Corruption Control as an intervening mechanism via which EP's impact on Environmental Performance assumes effectiveness. Our findings contribute to the theoretical discourse on EP by extending the analysis of EP impacts beyond its immediate outcomes (such as Corruption Control) to include higher-order macro-level impacts (such as Inclusive Human Development and Environmental Performance). In doing so, we uncover fresh evidence of EP's effectiveness in enabling Inclusive Human Development and Environmental Performance on a global scale.

This study attempts to identify the key challenges facing CSCs and determine their hierarchical relationships in the context of rural India. A set of 15 challenges was identified through a rigorous literature review and by surveying experts and CSC owners. Data were collected on the identified challenges and were analysed using interpretive structural modeling (ISM)-MICMAC-fuzzy MICMAC analysis. Subsequently, we developed a hierarchical model of challenges. The findings revealed that “longer travel time and transaction cost”, “low digital literacy”, and “low awareness” of e-government services are among the key challenges CSCs face in rural India.

We test the hypotheses derived from this theoretical framework using the results of the Municipal Transparency Index which is based on the information disclosed in the local governments' official websites and was applied to all Portuguese municipalities for the first time in 2013. Our findings indicate that municipalities with less financial autonomy, run by male mayors, with a larger number of consecutive terms in office, and smaller margins of victory in local elections display lower levels of transparency. On the demand-side, the unemployment rate and the average age of the municipal population emerge as the best predictors and are both negatively associated with transparency. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Access to information; Government websites; Local governance; Municipalities; Transparency indexes",""

While studies have visited the topic of e-participation factors, few have considered why some citizens engage in e-participation, while others do not. Drawing on social capital literature and technology adoption literature, this research suggests an integrated model of citizens' e-participation and empirically tests the model. Using an e-participation survey data collected in 2019, this study finds that citizens with a stronger social capital—a commitment to the community, ownership of the community, and trust in government—are more likely to engage in e-participation. However, the results do not show the significance of most TAM and TPB variables—perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and attitude toward e-participation. Only subjective norm and perceived behavioral control, core constructs of TPB, are significantly and positively related to citizens' engagement in e-participation. These findings demonstrate that individual social capital factors are more significant than TAM and TPB factors in explaining why some citizens use e-participation channels or applications, while others do not.

Comparative analysis suggests that OGP membership is correlated with higher e-participation scores, that this is not solely attributable to national political factors, but that alignment of national traditions and structures with civic participation norms has a positive moderating effect on OGP's relationship to e-participation. OGP's effect on collaborative e-decision-making is consistently more pronounced than OGP's effect on e-participation generally.

In this context, the Minister of Public Administration promoted the platform called ‘Bussola della Trasparenza’, the goal of which is to ensure easy access to institutional data of the municipalities and to evaluate the available information. However, we found that the results provided by this platform were unreliable. Our study of 525 municipalities showed severe discrepancies with Bussola's evaluation, suggesting a lack of transparency.

Such data can be potentially useful for enabling government authorities to improve their processes and services. For example, access to business documents and track and trace information associated with supply chain activities is of great interest to customs administrations. Such information holds the potential to make customs risk assessment processes more efficient and effective and to enable faster clearance of goods crossing borders. Businesses, however, are often not willing to voluntarily share information with the government beyond what is strictly mandated to be shared by law (e.g. submitting customs declarations). There is only limited academic research and a general lack of understanding amongst practitioners about how voluntary business-government information sharing can be achieved. In this study, we present a framework to analyse the barriers, drivers, and enablers of voluntary business-government information sharing and the governance processes that make such voluntary information sharing possible. Our analysis shows that voluntary business-government information sharing can succeed when there are strong drivers and a government agency willing to take the lead in initiating the process. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Benefits; Business; Factors; Framework; Governance; Government; Inter-agency collaboration; International trade; Leadership; Voluntary information sharing",""

E-participation, as any means of engagement with the common good, is, however, a difficult area of human motivation as it can be seen to exist outside the common hurdles of the everyday life and where the effects of participation are often invisible or take a long time to materialize. Recent trends of digitalization, such as gamification; a popular approach for stimulating motivation, have been proposed as remedies to foster e-participation. A plethora of applications and research has emerged related to gamified e-participation. However, there is currently a dearth in our knowledge of how gamification is being applied, researched or what its possible positive and negative outcomes can be. This study employed a systematic literature review approach in order to summarize research and findings on gamified e-participation. 66 papers were reviewed, the majority of which indicated that gamified e-participation is linked to increased engagement, motivation, civic learning and enjoyment amongst other outcomes.

Previous studies have found that automated systems are not suited to cover all citizens equally and may cause administrative burdens on excluded citizens. The case presented in this study is the automated system for awarding child benefits in Norway. Based on data from the national registry, most recipients are awarded the benefit automatically. However, some citizens are not covered by the automation and must apply manually. The theoretical framing of the study combines modern and classic views of how citizens access public services by combining theory from recent literature on administrative burdens and the older theory of access. The data analysis is done with process mining, an innovative method of sorting and understanding data. The findings support previous findings of how registry data and automated computer systems in government can create inequality in service quality. Furthermore, the findings also show that low-income citizens are disproportionally required to apply manually. The study addresses questions concerning why automated systems fail to cover all citizens and the potential challenges generated by this exclusion when governments rely on computer systems in delivering welfare programmes. These are important considerations, as government digitalisation is increasingly innovating with automated systems to deliver public services. © 2020 The Author","Administrative burdens; Administrative exclusion; Bureaucracy; Civil registry; Digital divide; Digital government; Digital welfare; Digitalization; e-Government; Process mining; Public value; Red tape",""

Since these evaluations affect the prospects for launching successful participatory platforms, it is imperative to assess what citizens want from such digital possibilities for participation. This study uses a conjoint experiment (n = 1048) conducted in Finland that explore the impact of seven design features: Discussion possibilities; Interaction with politicians and experts; Information availability, Aim of participation; Identity verification; Anonymous participation and Accessibility. Furthermore, it is examined whether the effects differ across use of ICTs measured by generation, time online and prior use of participatory platforms.

The proposed model extends the model primarily established on the theory of planned behavior, by incorporating additional factors that emerged from relevant literature. The research data were collected from a survey of 400 Facebook users in Jordan using a probability sample technique. The results revealed that the factors with the most significant influence on citizens' intention to engage in government-led e-participation initiatives through Facebook are: the citizens' attitude, participation efficacy, and perceived behavior control. Subjective norms and perceived value, however, have no direct effect on citizens' intention to engage in government-led e-participation initiatives through Facebook. Furthermore, the results showed that the citizens' attitude is primarily determined by participation efficacy, perceived usefulness and compatibility of Facebook, and perceived value. In contrast, the factors perceived ease of use of Facebook, citizens' trust in government, and citizens' trust in Facebook, have no significant impact on citizens' attitude. These factors have rarely been empirically tested in the context of e-participation. Consequently, this study paves the way towards a better understanding of the important factors that influence citizens' intention to participate, which, in turn, will inform the design and implementation of e-participation initiatives. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Acceptance factors; E-government; E-participation; Local government; Social media",""

By contrast there has been less research examining how these inputs translate into outcomes, or impacts that e-democracy has on changes in civic behavior or citizen engagement. Our study helps fill this knowledge gap by examining the impact that a specific set of information communication technologies (ICTs) have on a common form of civic engagement: voting. This research creates and tests two unique measures, the online election information index (OEII) and the e-registration service index (ERSI) to examine the extent to which local governments offer online information and utilities that help to educate voters and promote turnout. The index is tested on a sample of 396 county governments in the US to examine the extent to which governments' use of voting ICTs impacts voter participation, while accounting for other institutional and demographic factors that are known to shape voter turnout. We find that voter turnout is indeed higher in communities where local governments offer more voting ICTs, and the availability of these online resources may be particularly influential in boosting turnout in places where state policies serve to constrain or limit turnout. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","",""

Alarmingly, answers to this question are in short supply because of patchy comparative data. This study begins to address this gap by analyzing an exhaustive compilation of 265 transparency compliance evaluations (i.e. audits) authored by NGOs, academics, and government oversight authorities across Latin America between 2003 and 2018. Aggregating data on patterns of evaluation and public sector compliance with transparency statutes, we find modest increases in compliance over time, strikingly low compliance with passive transparency compliance (i.e. governmental responses to citizen requests) at the local versus national levels of government, and significantly higher compliance scores when government oversight agencies act as evaluators. Our data also reveal worrying gaps in evaluation efforts. Evaluators tend to focus far more on active transparency (i.e. website-based disclosure) than passive transparency, more on national level governments than subnational governments, and preponderantly on the executive as opposed to legislative or judicial branches of government. Textual analyses show that education is the most evaluated policy theme, with financial policies and social services close behind.

To test this hypothesis, we designed two survey experiments in which samples of US adults were primed with general information about the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or the existence of open government data. Compared to controls, we find that awareness of FOIA rights and requirements (latent transparency) tended to be unrelated, or even slightly negatively related, to trust of government agencies, contrary to our expectations.

If digital transformations are to progress, we need more nuanced empirical elaboration of the know-how managers require. To that end, this study reports evidence from case studies in 11 local governments in Canada. The findings provide the empirical basis for a theory of the know-how managers require to lead the implementation and enactment of integrated enterprise systems in support of digital transformation.

The strategies chosen by a municipality must consider not only what is communicated through social media channels, but the language used to convey the message. This study explores the relationship between linguistic factors and (a) the level of citizen engagement, and (b) the frequency of tweets on municipal Twitter accounts. Using textual analysis software, this study examines the linguistic style of Twitter feeds for the 100 most populous cities in the United States. The results suggest municipal accounts with higher tweet frequencies are more likely to use a present-tense, informal, and cognitively complex style with more feminine, health-related, and third-party references. Accounts with higher levels of citizen engagement were more likely to include references to anxiety, anger, and religion, positive and negative emotions, group affiliation, and personal motivations. The results also suggest an increased volume of Twitter activity has an inverse effect on engagement. This study contributes to the existing literature by providing an examination of the linguistic styles of active municipal Twitter communication and an analysis of how linguistic style predicts engagement. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Content analysis; Linguistics; Municipal; Social media; Twitter",""

Rather than looking at the relationship between nudger and nudgee, the research analyses the regulatory and market structures that affect nudge implementation by private actors, captured by the ‘budge’ idea. Focusing on the European energy policy domain, the paper analyses the contextual factors of green nudges that are initiated by Member States, and implemented by energy companies. The findings show that in the smart meter context, there are regulatory measures that affect implementation of smart meters and that government has a central role to ‘budge’, due to the dependence on private agents. © 2020 The Author(s)","Compliance; Energy policy; Green nudges; Policy implementation; Regulation; Smart meters",""

This “disintermediation” of (i.e., greater direct access to) public information may improve transparency and facilitate citizen engagement, but it may also overwhelm citizens not only with too much information but also by requiring them to take responsibility for gathering, assembling, and processing information. Despite the importance of effective information processing to successful use of available information, existing studies have not yet fully integrated this consideration into research on citizen use of e-government and open government data. Based on information processing theory—according to which individuals have a finite information processing capacity, which is affected not only by the quantity and quality of information but also by one's preferences for how information is presented—this study examined the effects of information presentation type (infographic versus text) on perceived information overload, along with the consequent effect of information overload on perceived website usefulness. We also investigated whether individual information processing propensity (visual or verbal) moderated the effect of information presentation type on perceived information overload. Our results showed that textual information tended to cause greater information overload, especially for those with a propensity for visual information processing, and that higher information overload was associated with a lower perception of website usefulness. Moreover, individual information propensity moderated the effect of information type on perceived information overload; people with visual information processing propensity were more strongly affected by the presentation of textual information. We discuss the implications of our findings for improving the communication of policy information through government websites. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","E-government; Information behavior; Information overload; Information processing; Open government data",""

Analyses based on an experimental online survey in Japan generated results indicating that, if a government were to announce its intention to use “AI” chatbots to answer public enquiries, the public's initial trust in their responses would be lower in the area of parental support than in the area of waste separation, with a moderate effect size. Communicating purposes that would directly benefit citizens, such as achieving uniformity in response quality and timeliness in responding, would enhance public trust in chatbots. Although the effect sizes are small, communicating these purposes might be still worthwhile, as it would be an inexpensive measure for a government to take. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Administrative discretion; Artificial intelligence; Chatbot; Human-machine relationship; Public service; Public trust; Street-level bureaucracy",""

These investments are particularly important as an attempt to close digital divides among countries and regions within countries. However, there is no clear evidence that suggests that current Information and Communication Technology (ICT) policies are helping align investments with the actual needs of the local contexts. Based on data about the allocation of 2014–2020 EU Funds, this paper analyzes the relationship between local needs and investment decisions aiming at bridging territorial digital divides. The results identify four different regional strategies developed around four policy goals: broadband, digital inclusion, digital government services, and the use of ICTs in enterprises. The results also show that unlike the past 2007–13 period, the allocations to these goals appear to be consistent with the ICT local context, i.e. funding for a given goal is higher in the regions that need it the most. Therefore, our main recommendation for the European Commission and Member States is to keep existing requirements for developing evidence-informed “Digital Growth” strategies for the next 2021–27 period.

Scholars have already offered several fascinating explanations of why governments adopt transparency policies that constrain their choices. However, knowledge of their impacts is limited. Does greater access to information deliver on its promises as an anti-corruption policy? While some research has already addressed this question in relation to freedom of information laws, the emergence of new digital technologies enabled new policies, such as open government data. Its effects on corruption remain empirically underexplored due to its novelty and a lack of measurements. In this article, I provide the first empirical study of the relationship between open government data, relative to FOI laws, and corruption. I propose a theoretical framework, which specifies conditions necessary for FOI laws and open government data to affect corruption levels, and I test it on a novel cross-country dataset. The results suggest that the effects of open government data on corruption are conditional upon the quality of media and internet freedom. Moreover, other factors, such as free and fair elections, independent and accountable judiciary, or economic development, are far more critical for tackling corruption than increasing access to information. These findings are important for policies. In particular, digital transparency reforms will not yield results in the anti-corruption fight unless robust provisions safeguarding media and internet freedom complement them. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","accountability; corruption; cross-country analysis; freedom of information; media and internet freedom; open government data; transparency",""

Regulators, banks, and financial markets all had encompassing theoretical models about how the economy worked, but they all failed to predict the looming crisis. As such, regulators increasingly turn to big data to understand banks' health. Despite the prominence of big data in society, its use in the public sector remains grossly understudied. This paper explores the regulatory use of big data in the case of the EU-wide banking stress test, a key regulatory indicator. The paper draws on interviews with supervisors at the European Central Bank (ECB), European Banking Authority (EBA) and National Bank of Belgium (NBB), as well as with consultants and risk directors in Belgian banks, to explain how big data-driven regulation affects the relationship between regulators and regulated entities. It draws particular attention to the epistemological component of using large data sets in decision-making: a big data state of mind. The article more specifically shows how the underlying epistemology, rather than simply the bigness of datasets, affects the relationship between regulators and regulated entities, and the regulatory process at large. The paper concludes that regulators' big data state of mind calls for new practical and legal guidelines regarding the validity of data-driven knowledge claims. Moreover, it shows how accountability based on descriptive transparency no longer makes sense in the ‘age of the algorithm’, suggesting a shift towards relational transparency and joint knowledge production. © 2021 The Author","Accountable AI; Banking stress test; Big data; Epistemology; Financial regulation; Transparency",""

While smart sensors and IoT technologies have great potential to transform public service provision, their adoption in the public sector seems to be slow and incremental. Using cross-sectional data of 65 large and mid-sized cities in the United States, we examine what affects local governments' adoption of smart and connected sensors. We propose a path-dependence explanation for the incremental adoption and test if a local government's sensor adoption behavior is shaped by its existing policy priorities and managerial practices in related fields. Our results show that local governments' early adoption of smart sensors is likely to stem from their needs in specific policy domains. We also find that a local government's historical paths on urban sustainability and data-driven decision-making practices can predict its trajectory of sensor deployment, in terms of the scope and the integration of smart sensors across different urban domains. Surprisingly, a local government's e-government progressiveness is not a significant predictor. Our results confirm the incremental change in smart sensor adoption and provide implications for local governments' IoT planning. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Data-driven decision-making; E-government; Internet of Things; Path dependence; Smart sensors; Urban sustainability",""

The direct effects of participation antecedents on participation outcomes have been fully examined, but few researchers have investigated the internal mechanism of citizen participation at the level of psychological value perception. The roles of perceived public and private value between the participation antecedents and outcomes remain unclear. Private value merits careful research in particular as the E-governance environment is being shaped by increasing privatization and continuous IT innovation. Based on the cognitive integration theory and the civic voluntarism model, this paper proposes a theoretical framework to examine the mediating roles of two values. We built a complete research model encompassing ten hypotheses centered on citizen e-participation in the context of green commuting governance. By analyzing survey data on a green commuting platform, we demonstrate the significant mediating effects of these two values and greater effect of private value acquisition on continuous e-participation intentions than public value creation.

Nevertheless, transitioning from the “electronic” to the stage of “transformational” domain – coined as t-Government – is posing the greatest challenge of how government services respond to changes in the broader economy and society. Despite considerable investments and the wide use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), research literature on e-Government suggests that government services have yet to reach the full potential of seamless integration, where all transactions are completed electronically. Through a detailed analysis of the extant e-Government literature and a case study based empirical research, this paper explores the domain of e-Government in identifying the possible reasons for this potential shortfall in achieving full integration. Furthermore, the paper intends to highlight an aspect of complexity surrounding crossing the integration gap as the authors denote by “eChasm” in the e-Government conceptual model that leads to transformation. In addition, it focuses on radical change through Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) and the call for strategic style of leadership, for cross-agency collaboration leading to a successful realisation of transformational government (t-Government). It is interesting to note that researchers and public sector leaders have started to realise that implementing and managing the transformation of public services, copiously satisfying the users and stakeholders, is a task of multi-dimensional complexity. © 2018","Business Process Re-engineering; e-Government; eChasm; Maturity model; Organisational change; Strategic leadership; t-Government",""

Such frameworks are available in information systems (IS) literature but lack an account of the particularities of e-participation.

First, despite reasonable efforts to improve the design of forms and to establish single points of contact in one-stop shops, citizens still perceive forms as cumbersome. Second, citizens expect governments to act proactively by initiating appropriate government services themselves, instead of relying on requests for services from citizens. To address these two issues, this paper proposes a transition from a one-stop shop to a no-stop shop, where the citizen does not have to perform any action or fill in any forms to receive government services. The contribution of this paper is an e-government stage model that extends existing models. Stage models are suitable tools with which to inspire future developments, and ours extends previous models that guide progress toward the one-stop shop by describing two further stages: the limited no-stop shop and the no-stop shop.

This paper fills this important gap by using self-determination theory (SDT) to analyze how the use of social media for work purposes is associated with government employees’ need satisfaction and intrinsic work motivation. According to regression results, employees’ use of social media is positively related to employees’ need satisfaction (autonomy, relatedness, and competence) and, accordingly, intrinsic work motivation. However, further analysis shows that too much use of social media has an averse effect. Theoretically, this study is one of the pioneer attempts to integrate e-governance with SDT. Practically, we encourage managers to use caution in promoting the use of social media for work purposes.

To address this gap, we design a randomized survey experiment to demonstrate how the choice of reference points – cognitive anchors that innately influence the way individuals approach decisions – used to communicate government information can strengthen the relationship between public information disclosure and citizen engagement, and in turn the effectiveness of open government initiatives.

Following the two approaches of smart city development from Kuk and Janssen (2011), the study proposed a synergetic framework for understanding the relationship between information architectures and business models. Since community is a basic unit of a city, the development goals of a smart city are needed to be implemented at the level of communities. The development path of smart community is a configuration set including both information architecture factors and business model patterns. Based on the cases of 69 communities from Beijing, China, we explored successful configurations based on the framework. Using the Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) method, we found that a successful smart community depends on the integration between information architectures and business models, and different business models rely on different information architectures elements. Networking, terminals, and sensors are key information architecture elements that are used more frequently in business models. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Business models; Information architectures; Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA); Smart city; Smart community; Synergetic framework",""

Some methods have emerged that presuppose well-organized data catalogs, the availability of API interfaces and natively exposed metadata. However, many data portals, particularly those of local governments, appear to be misimplemented and developed with the classic website model in mind, which provides access to data only through user interaction with web forms. Data in such portals resides in the hidden part of the web, as it is dynamically produced only in response to direct requests. This paper proposes an automated method for assessing government-related data in the deep web on the basis of compliance with open data principles and requirements. To validate our method, we apply it in an experiment using the government websites of the 27 Brazilian capitals. The method is fully carried out for 22 of the capitals' websites, resulting in the analysis of 5.6 million government web pages. The results indicate that the keyword search approach utilized in the method, along with the checking of web pages for multifield web forms, is effective for identifying deep web data sources, as 1.5% of web pages with potential government data that are analyzed are found to contain data stored in the deep web. This work contributes to the development of a novel method that allows for the continuous checking and identification of government data from surface web data portals. In addition, this method can be scaled and repeated to assure the widest possible content coverage. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Assessment; Benchmarking; Data portals; Deep web; Open government data",""

Governments also send more and more information via computer mediated communication instead of writing a paper letter to citizens. As a consequence, governments are increasingly exposed to the risk that citizens do not notice or act upon notifications that refer to governmental (sometimes legally binding) messages. This in turn may result in non-compliant behavior. Through a vignette study in three large scale surveys held in the Netherlands in 2015 and 2016, we have investigated how the channel (paper letter channel vs. e-mail channel that notifies that there is a digital letter available at a web portal) influences the speed with which people intend to read the actual content of a message while taking digital skills and expectations of the contents of a message into account. Results show that the channel has a significant and strong impact on the speed with which citizens read the contents of the message. This means that there is a risk that the efficiency gains that are won by communicating electronically are lost in effectiveness due to increased non-compliance because people do not actually see the government information that is sent to them.

The understanding of the factors that influence the continuous intention to use e-participation over time is critical for the design of diffusion and promotion strategies that motivate the citizens to keep using e-participation. This article explores the drivers that predict the post-adoption of e-participation platforms from the perspective of the sense of virtual community theory, that is the degree of affective attachment to a given community mediated by information technology. Specifically, our research model evaluates the association between the sense of virtual community with use behaviour and the continuous intention to use e-participation. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate the data collected from 370 citizens who experienced an e-participation platform hosted by a European capital city. We found out that the direct association between the sense of virtual community and use was significant. Even though the direct association between the sense of virtual community and the continuous intention was non-significant, the indirect association sense of virtual community to use to continuous intention was statistically significant. This finding may indicate that the use behaviour is triggered by the influence of other members of the community for a short period of time, but it does not persist to influence the continuous intention over time. © 2019 The Authors","E-government; E-participation; Online participatory budgeting; PLS-SEM; Post-adoption; Sense of virtual community; UTAUT",""

On the government's side, social media can provide a conduit for communicating health risk information in an effective and timely fashion, while also engaging citizens in informed decision-making. On the citizen's side, information communication technology (ICT)-based practices cannot function unless citizens recognize and act on their responsibility to actively engage with government social media platforms. Despite an increasing interest in understanding the adoption of ICT practices and e-government services for health risk communication, there remains a crucial need for a comprehensive framework to explain which factors determine citizen use of digital government resources. The purpose of this study is to investigate how to increase government accountability for motivating citizens to engage in ICT-based health risk communication, thereby attaining sustainable public health practices through collaborative governance. By integrating trust and health risk information into the e-government adoption model (GAM), this research examines factors that influence citizens' likelihood of using government social media resources. Survey data from 700 Korean citizens were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results indicated that individuals with higher social media competency are more likely to (a) seek risk information through social media and (b) perceive the government's social media sites as easy to use. Consistent with the GAM, intentions to use the government's social media sites for information and interactions appear to increase as citizens perceive more value in using them regarding information quality, ease of use, functional benefit, and security. Furthermore, perceived trust in the government's social media resources appears to function as a mediator of this process. Initial trust in the government is an important determinant of perceptions of its digital resources. Citizens who trust the government tend to evaluate new initiatives positively and are more likely to accept and make use of them. The results of this study can inform policy design and implementation by elucidating the mechanisms that determine citizens' adoption and usage of digital government services. Theoretically, this work expands the GAM to include health risk communication and adds empirical evidence to the small yet growing body of knowledge of e-government initiatives. These findings also highlight the importance of public trust in the government, as this encourages citizens to seek health risk information and assistance from the government. Overall, the data and model generated in this investigation represent an important step toward the successful and sustainable modernization of public services. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Collaborative governance; Digital government; E-government adoption model; Health risk communication; Information-communication technology; Public health; Social media; Sustainable development",""

Building on information systems (IS) success and IS continuance literature, this study proposes an extended conceptual framework by adding perceived functional benefit (PFB) as mediating, perceived risk as moderating, and demographic characteristics as control variables. The data collected, through a web-based survey, from 409 users of e-tax services in an emerging economy are analyzed through covariance-based structural equation modeling. Results confirm that PFB, confirmation of expectation, and satisfaction are the major antecedents of continuance intention for e-tax filing. The study also finds the evidence for the indirect effects of IS success factors on continuance intention through such antecedents. In addition, results suggest that the relationships between PFB and satisfaction as well as between PFB and continuance intention are contingent on the users’ levels of perceived risk.

However, many public administrations still struggle with such innovations due to complex technologies, high investments, and the numerous stakeholders involved. To address this issue, some local governments in continental Europe have turned to collaborative innovation approaches, partnering with (semi-)public utility companies in the hope that their additional innovation assets will boost innovativeness. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how exactly such collaborations should be governed to ensure that the focus remains on creating public value, as utility companies may have their own agendas. To explore this question, we conducted a comparative case study in the context of smart city initiatives with four cases in Swiss local governments. Drawing on agency and stewardship theory, we then propose a model of public-value-focused collaborative innovation, enabling us to explore various collaboration characteristics and their effects on public value creation. Our findings suggest that both agency- and stewardship-based collaborations increase innovativeness. However, while agency collaborations tend to produce smart city innovations that mainly serve the utility companies' business interests, stewardship relationships lead to innovations that are focused more on public value creation. As such, our study extends the literature on the effects of collaborative innovation on public value, and it provides practical recommendations on how such collaborative innovation should be designed. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Agency theory; Collaborative innovation; Local government; Public value; Smart city; Stewardship theory; Switzerland; Utility company",""

Microblog has been employed in the rural areas to enhance public services. We propose that by facilitating collaboration among public employees and enabling supervision of their services, microblog can help enhance the public service climate and improve public service performance in the rural areas. A research model is developed to evaluate the importance of microblog affordance and public service capabilities based on the service climate theory. Through surveying the grassroots public employees in 382 villages, we find that the collaboration and supervision affordances of microblog are important in leading to better public service climate. While the collaboration affordance of microblog has both direct and indirect effects, its supervision affordance effect is indirect through enhancing the content delivery and service fulfillment capacities. Furthermore, our additional analysis shows that public service climate can raise the service satisfaction of the rural citizens. The findings show that microblog adoption enhances public service climate in the rural areas where less attention is given. A set of important recommendations are provided to public administrators on how they can more effectively leverage on the emerging microblog technology in the rural context. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Microblog; Public service climate; Public service satisfaction; Rural areas; Social media",""

From tax payments to passport requests, citizens have to interact with low-interactivity information artifacts such as reports, maps and datasets, among many others. Despite efforts to improve information delivery in the public sector, effective information usage remains a critical topic of action and research. The user experience of government documents has rarely been assessed, despite them being regularly published and frequently used. Considering this, the two following research questions arise: 1) How can government documents be classified (or grouped) in terms of user experience? 2) How can the user experience of government documents be monitored over time in order to inform design decisions? Working with a public agency in Chile, we develop and test a classification and monitoring framework based on two online surveys (N = 338 and N = 298). We then propose a framework for understanding user experience of government documents in these three dimensions: interaction goal, volume of information and ease of understanding. Using a graphical representation to classify user experience provides greater visibility of the current status of information produced by a public organization. Furthermore, by monitoring the user experience of a government document at different times, organizations can understand the effect of their design decisions and improve their service quality by implementing user-centered processes. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Government documents; Information Classification; Information Quality; Monitoring; Public Sector Information; User experience",""

The model was tested with partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) using a survey of local government agencies in China. The empirical results show that the two dimensions of e-Gov cloud assimilation - depth and breadth - have significantly positive effects: (1) directly on operational public value and (2) indirectly on strategic public value through operational public value. Moreover, the complementary fit strategy of the depth and breadth of e-Gov cloud has a significantly positive effect on strategic public value, while the balanced fit strategy has no significant effect.

To this day, Political Science has not managed to provide a quantitative answer to these questions. By placing a scientific focus on this gap, the current examination will conceptualise a quantitative measure for legislative pace which is analogous to the tempo of music. This will permit the author to place the (subjective) temporal perception of law-making procedures into the overall context of legislature. A database, which contains machine-readable data extracted and transformed from semi-structured documents, will be highlighted for its ability to measure legislative pace in Germany. As a result, every procedural step within all the adopted federal laws in Germany (between autumn 1990 and autumn 2017), is able to be processed by computers. Finally, the paper employs the aforementioned database and the conceptualised quantification of pace (metronome) to shed light on legislative pace in Germany. Results are presented for the 16th legislative period (2005–2009) of the German Bundestag. Thus, the paper contributes to an ongoing dispute between “acceleration-optimist” and “deliberation-supporters” with respect to their views on the speed of legislation. The paper shows to what extend law-making can accelerate in times of parliamentary truce or in cases of broad consent between the majoritarian actors. However, this does not always imply a diminished (parliamentarian) interest inclusion and control. In general, institutional time-rules and parliamentary practices offer reliable so called “checks and balances” to monitor legislative acceleration. Nevertheless, what seems to be lacking, is a stronger set of rules that control the power of government and the parliamentarian factions' ability to delay law-making procedures. © 2019 The Author","Data-wrangling; Database; Germany; Law-making; Legislative pace; Policy-making; Temporality; Transparency",""

However, few studies have attempted to understand the determinants of CRR in government CBIS initiatives. Sayogo, Gil-Garcia, and Cronemberger's (2016) analysis of results of a national survey identified three significant determinants of CRR in CBIS, (1) the extent participants use boundary objects, (2) participant skills in terms of collaboration, coordination, and communication, and (3) the diversity of the participating organizations and their goals.

In practical terms, creating new understanding of the determinants of CRR has value for public managers and their leadership as they must increasingly collaborate and share information across the boundaries of organizations in the process solving increasingly complex public problems. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Boundary objects; Clarity of responsibilities; Clarity of roles; Digital government; Information integration; Information sharing; Trust",""

Secondly, by qualitatively analyzing two frontrunner cases, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, this study analyzes how social media policies address and can help overcome these barriers. The empirical analysis indicates that in addressing barriers to social media adoption, a combination of exploration and exploitation is needed to address both structural and cultural barriers to social media adoption.

Furthermore, we find that cultural tightness-looseness, which is defined as the strength of social norms and degree of sanctioning within the society, negatively moderates the relationship between the nation's social media usage and control of corruption. The relationship is stronger for the set of countries with loose culture, and vice versa.

Therefore, the aim of this paper is to clarify open data use and engagement by people outside the public sector, especially what motives exists and how different user types align to these motives. To achieve this, a document analysis has been carried out of reported use cases identified in EU topic reports between 2014 and 2016.

An empirical analysis conducted on a sample of 262 Italian municipalities supported this hypothesis. The study also showed that no unique set of factors could explain the differences in the electronic disclosure of performance information by Italian municipalities, but disclosure was observed to depend—at least in part—on how municipalities deliver public services. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Accountability; E-disclosure; Local government; Outsourcing; Performance reporting; Public service delivery",""

It is the information captured as part of the identity surrounding the citizen which decides what services and products one is entitled to and can access. At present, there are still around 1.1 billion people in the world without any official identity and to address this concern, United Nations through its 16th Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recommended governments to provide their citizens with unique identities by 2030. India's Aadhaar is one consequential step in this direction as it has already reached over 1 billion enrolments in India. However establishing a national identity program successfully requires expertise, time, and huge financial commitments. This paper takes Aadhaar as a case study and uses Design Theory (DT) and Critical Success Factor theory (CSF) as a theoretical lens and attempts to evaluate design and execution choices made during the tenure of the project. The study also identifies and prioritizes primary goals of Aadhaar based on the secondary data, expert opinion through a Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and subsequently systematic prioritization using mixed research methodologies. The expert opinion from the FGD was analyzed using the Best-Worst method (BWM), followed by the Total Interpretive Structural Modeling (TISM) method and Matrix of Cross Impact Multiplications Applied to Classification (MICMAC) analysis. The study identified uniqueness, security and privacy as the top priority goals in an identity system and is 11 times more crucial than scalability which is identified to be of lesser priority. These findings from this study could be considered as a reference for other countries that aim to develop and implement digital identity for its citizens. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Aadhaar; Best-Worst; Critical Success Factor; Design theory; Digital identity; e-Governance; TISM",""

This paper therefore develops a theoretical framework on the determinants for the adoption of interoperability standards by organisations in Government Information Networks. Based on a literature review and data from two case studies in the Netherlands, it identifies the relevant determinants and conceptually groups them into seven determinant constructs. For each of these constructs, relevant sub-constructs are specified. By identifying key adoption determinants, the framework thus provides a useful analytical lens for policy-makers and researchers working on interoperability in government. © 2016","Determinant model; Development; Electronic governance; Government Information Networks; Interoperability; Interoperability governance; Standards adoption",""

However, since little attention has been given to the impact of GaaP on public value creation more research is needed to analyse whether the GaaP is effective to help the government to deliver public services that fulfil social expectations and, hence, public value. Indeed, efficiency does not guarantee public value. Besides efficiency, public value incorporates citizens' variegated expectations and needs that change over time and that are sometimes rival. For these reasons, the delivery of public value is often challenging for public agencies. The aim of this paper is to explain how the GaaP configuration can help public administration to deliver public value better. The paper finds that the modularity of the platform configuration and different ecosystems that support public agencies need to be orchestrated to support the effective creation of public value. The authors analyse the case of the Italian GaaP initiative to discuss the importance of the orchestration of the GaaP characteristics to improve the coordination among public agencies and enable the co-production of services with external actors, in order to deliver public value better. The findings show that the orchestration of the GaaP configuration characteristics can enable Italian public administration to deliver public value, but also that, if the GaaP is not properly orchestrated, it can constrain the creation of public value. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ecosystems; GaaP; Orchestration; Public value",""

A large body of academic studies has attempted to identify and explain the potential causes and consequences of corruption, at varying levels of granularity, mostly through theoretical lenses by using correlations and regression-based statistical analyses. The present study approaches the phenomenon from the predictive analytics perspective by employing contemporary machine learning techniques to discover the most important corruption perception predictors based on enriched/enhanced nonlinear models with a high level of predictive accuracy. Specifically, within the multiclass classification modeling setting that is employed herein, the Random Forest (an ensemble-type machine learning algorithm) is found to be the most accurate prediction/classification model, followed by Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks. From the practical standpoint, the enhanced predictive power of machine learning algorithms coupled with a multi-source database revealed the most relevant corruption-related information, contributing to the related body of knowledge, generating actionable insights for administrator, scholars, citizens, and politicians. The variable importance results indicated that government integrity, property rights, judicial effectiveness, and education index are the most influential factors in defining the corruption level of significance. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Corruption perception; Government integrity; Machine learning; Predictive modeling; Random forest; Social development; Society policies and regulations",""

However, much recent work on big data in public decision-making assumes a rational view of decision-making, which has been much criticized in the public administration debate. In this paper, we apply this view, and a more political one, to the context of big data and offer a qualitative study. We question the impact of big data on decision-making, realizing that big data – including its new methods and functions – must inevitably encounter existing political and managerial institutions. By studying two illustrative cases of big data use processes, we explore how these two worlds meet. Specifically, we look at the interaction between data analysts and decision makers. In this we distinguish between a rational view and a political view, and between an information logic and a decision logic. We find that big data provides ample opportunities for both analysts and decision makers to do a better job, but this doesn't necessarily imply better decision-making, because big data also provides opportunities for actors to pursue their own interests. Big data enables both data analysts and decision makers to act as autonomous agents rather than as links in a functional chain. Therefore, big data's impact cannot be interpreted only in terms of its functional promise; it must also be acknowledged as a phenomenon set to impact our policymaking institutions, including their legitimacy. © 2018 The Authors","",""

Co-creation can be seen as an intensive type of citizen participation, involving active collaboration between government and citizens on specific policy issues. In the context of a Dutch province, we investigated citizens' intentions to participate in co-creation processes and experimentally compared the effects of three co-creation configurations (idea contest, grassroots groups, digital platform) on their intentions. Data were collected using online questionnaires (N = 354). Participants first answered general questions about their intentions to participate, and were then randomly assigned to a description of one of the configurations. Citizens' general intention to participate was related to their educational level, interest in provincial politics, perceived value of citizen participation, expected personal gratification, and perceived behavioral control. Of the three co-creation configurations, grassroots groups and digital platforms led to somewhat higher intentions to participate. An analysis of determinants per configuration shows that expected personal gratification played an important role in all three configurations. Perceived behavioral control was an additional determinant for the grassroots groups and digital platform configurations.

Profile generation is an essential task in the development of VAAs and requires two steps: an unbiased design of political questionnaires and the collection of all candidates' answers. This paper presents an extension of a VAA, implemented in within the project Participa Inteligente (PI), a social-network platform designed for the 2017 Ecuadorian national elections. This work concentrates on the implementation of dynamic candidate profiling using Twitter data and sentiment analysis as an additional element to the static profile generation of VAAs. The implementation of a dynamic element for VAAs could help mitigate the effect of biased recommendations given during the construction of candidate and party profiles.

This drastic development has raised the hopes of citizens for better lives, in both developing and advanced countries, urging innovation in government to make it more competent. Due to e-business revolutions, governments around the world have applied similar principles and technologies to government by opening their websites for more efficient publication of information and more effective delivery of public services. While a government website is an important venue for citizens to participate in public affairs and decision-making processes, early e-government practices tended to overlook democratic purposes by focusing on the features of e-business and information systems. There have been increasing criticisms that e-government system design has focused mainly on the provider's perspectives. Reflecting on the theoretical implications of this, we argue that a government website should facilitate democratic processes involving not only information sharing and delivery of better public services, but also deliberation and coproduction. The purpose of this study is to probe into multidimensional features that enable government websites to fulfill their promises. Developing an integrative model for evaluating a government website, namely the Democratic E-governance Website Evaluation Model, we conducted a qualitative meta-analysis of four strands of literature: information systems, business, public administration, and democratic theory. Our study contributes to the literature by extending the purview of e-government website analysis beyond the question of citizens' acceptance and towards the issue of their engagement, bringing a stimulating view of citizens as active agents in governance, and it provides a holistic model for public authorities to improve their websites to facilitate democratic e-governance that helps to create more effective public outcomes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Democratic e-governance; Democratic governance; E-governance; E-government; Government website; Participatory governance; Website evaluation",""

This paper analyzes the presence of Audit Institutions in Web 2.0 and SM tools, in the EU and US, at regional and central government level, in order to answer the following research questions: What is the level of adoption of Web 2.0 and SM tools among Audit Institutions? Can any patterns of adoption be identified? What factors are related to the adoption of Web 2.0 and SM tools? What is the main objective of the content published? What is the number of followers and the level of citizen awareness? Results show that the adoption of Web 2.0 and SM tools by Audit Institutions is at an initial stage. There are differences in adoption between Supreme and Regional Audit Institutions, among the different public administration styles, and depending on the population size and level of use of SM and previous levels of transparency at country level. This results in predictable patterns of adoption consistent with path dependencies derived from the institutional context and citizen demands. The number of followers and citizens' awareness is generally low and the contents published rarely aim at encouraging stakeholder participation.

We argue for a conceptualization and critical reflection on the nature of the underlying interaction between citizens and public officials - the public encounter - that digital public services are developed to support. We apply a qualitative and hermeneutic approach and illustrate that digital public services change public encounters concerning when, where, and how interactions occur, what each actor does, and the skills required of them. By relating these changes to emerging digital technologies (e.g. data mining, machine learning, sensor technology, and service automation), we illustrate that while these new technologies carry the potential to further digitalize service provision and fulfill the democratic goals of digital government, authorities can apply the same technology to restrict, control, and surveil citizens. Based on a critical discussion on what digitalization might entail for society, we identify problem areas arising from this development and propose a research agenda for understanding this phenomenon further. We raise questions and ethical concerns regarding accountability and reskilling of citizens and public officials as public service provision becomes citizen self-service. © 2019 The Authors","Citizen–government interaction; Digitalization; Public service; Theory-building",""

To address this gap, based on the media richness theory, this study aims to explore workers' online social anxiety, LINE cognitive fatigue (LCF) and perceived information overload of IM (PIOIM) affecting their job engagement. The data used in this study were collected from 429 civil servants in Taiwan via an online survey and were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results show that online social anxiety is positively related to LCF and PIOIM. Respondents with higher LCF and PIOIM are less likely to be involved in job activities. Online social anxiety is negatively related to job engagement mediated by LCF and PIOIM.

Focusing on philanthropic crowdfunding, we examine whether collaborative projects between public and private organizations are more successful in fundraising than projects initiated solely by private organizations. We argue that government involvement in crowdfunding provides some type of accreditation or certification that attests to a project's aim to achieve public rather than private goals, thereby mitigating information asymmetry and improving mutual trust between creators (i.e., private sector organizations) and funders (i.e., crowd). To support this argument, we show that crowdfunding projects with government involvement achieved a greater success rate and attracted a greater amount of funding than comparable projects without government involvement. This evidence shows that governments may take advantage of crowdfunding to “co-fund” public projects with the citizenry for addressing the complex challenges that we face in the twenty-first century. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Collaborative innovation; Crowdfunding; Information asymmetry; Moral hazard; Public sector innovation; Public-private partnerships",""

This may reduce individuals' perceived ability to control their personal information and increase their perceived privacy risk. A systematic understanding of individuals' privacy concerns is important as negative user perceptions are a challenge to service providers' reputation and may hamper service delivery processes as they influence users' trust and willingness to disclose personal information. This study develops and validates a model that examines the effect of organizational privacy assurances on individual privacy concerns, privacy control and risk perceptions, trust beliefs and non-self-disclosure behavior. Drawing on a survey to 547 users of different types of e-services – e-government, e-commerce and social networking – in Rwanda, and working within the framework of exploratory analysis, this study uses partial least square-structural equation modeling to validate the overall model and the proposed hypotheses. The findings show that perceptions of privacy risks and privacy control are antecedents of e-service users' privacy concerns, trust and non-self-disclosure behavior. They further show that the perceived effectiveness of privacy policy and perceived effectiveness of self-regulations influence both perceptions of privacy risks and control and their consequences; users' privacy concerns, trust and non-self-disclosure behavior. The hypotheses are supported differently across the three types of e-services, which means that privacy is specific to context and situation. The study shows that the effect of privacy assurances on trust is different in e-government services than in other services which suggest that trust in e-government may be more complex and different in nature than in other contexts. The findings serve to enhance a theoretical understanding of organizational privacy assurances and individual privacy concerns, trust and self-disclosure behavior.

On its face, this type of citizen engagement appears to realize the promise of social media in the public sector to increase agency accountability, transparency, and legitimacy. However, research suggests that police agencies primarily use social media as a way to manage their public image, rather than for citizen engagement. In addition, the degree to which citizens use social media to hold police agencies accountable is unclear. We examined both sides by analyzing the emotional tone (sentiment) of over 350,000 police agency Facebook posts and user comments after a fatal officer-involved shooting of a citizen in 2016. On average, police agency posts were decidedly neutral in tone and did not change in the post-shooting time period, suggesting they did not post more positive content after the shooting in an attempt to bolster their public image. While user comments were more negative compared to pre-shooting levels, on average, the magnitude of the change was small, essentially neutral, and increased almost to pre-shooting levels very quickly. We also found small differences in user comment sentiment based on the race and armed status of the victim, but not in the expected direction.

Though traditionally there have always been transactional elements between government and citizen, for example payment of taxes in exchange for services, or voting in exchange for representation, the rise of modern smartphone and smart city technologies have further enabled micro-transactions between citizen, government, and information broker. We conceptualize how the modern smart city, as both envisaged and enacted, incorporates the citizen not necessarily as a whole actor, but as a series of micro-transactions encoded on the real-time landscape of the city. This transactional citizen becomes counted by smart city sensors and integrated into smart city decision-making through the use of certain preferred platforms. To approach this shift from traditional forms of citizen/city interaction towards micro-transactions, we conceptualize four broad modes of transaction; type (intentional contribution), tweet (intermediated by third party), tap (convened or requested transaction), and pass (ambient transaction based on movement). These four modes are used to frame critical questions of how citizens interact with government in the emerging age of the smart city, and how these interactions impact the relationship between citizen and government, introducing new avenues for private sector influence. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Citizen participation; Civic engagement; Open government; Smart city; Technology implementation",""

To do so, we use the grounded theory literature review method. We identify several concepts which are used to describe this phenomenon and propose an integrative definition of “data driven social partnerships” based on them. We also identify a list of challenges which data driven social partnerships face and explore the most urgent and most cited ones, thereby proposing a research agenda. Finally, we discuss the main contributions of this emerging research field, in relation to the challenges, and systematize the knowledge base about this phenomenon for the research community. © 2018 The Authors","Big data; Collaboration; Data collaborative; Data donation; Data partnership; Data philanthropy",""

This paper makes a contribution in this direction: it presents a novel approach, as well as the architecture of an ICT platform supporting it, for the advanced exploitation of a specific AI technology, namely chatbots, in the public sector in order to address a crucial issue: the improvement of communication between government and citizens (which has for long time been problematic). The proposed approach builds on natural language processing, machine learning and data mining technologies, and leverages existing data of various forms (such as documents containing legislation and directives, structured data from government agencies’ operational systems, social media data, etc.), in order to develop a new digital channel of communication between citizens and government. Making use of appropriately structured and semantically annotated data, this channel enables ‘richer’ and more expressive interaction of citizens with government in everyday language, facilitating and advancing both information seeking and conducting of transactions. Compared to existing digital channels, the proposed approach is appropriate for a wider range of citizens’ interactions, with higher levels of complexity, ambiguity and uncertainty. In close co-operation with three Greek government agencies (the Ministry of Finance, a social security organization, and a big local government organization), this approach has been validated through a series of application scenarios. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","",""

This paper aims to help clarify the relationship between these two concepts by exploring a recently coined phenomenon: OGD-driven co-created public services. These services 1) utilize or are driven by OGD; 2) are co-created by stakeholders from different groups; and 3) produce public value for society. Due to the relative newness of the phenomenon an inductive exploratory case study is undertaken on Chicago's use of OGD in the co-creation of their food safety inspection forecasting model. This model forecasts critical food safety violations at food serving establishments and sends inspectors to the highest risk establishments first. The results of this exploratory work led to the discovery of a ‘perfect storm’ of six factors that seem to play a key role in allowing OGD-driven public service co-creation to take place. These factors are motivated stakeholders, innovative leaders, proper communication, an existing OGD portal, external funding, and agile development. © 2018 The Authors","Co-creation; Open government data; Predictive analytics; Public service innovation",""

With the increased digitization of our world, recent work suggests that the digitally-enabled relationships of how policy makers and citizens observe each other may transform policy making in a fundamental way. In this paper, we use complexity theory to examine how digitally-enabled transparency affects the effectiveness of policy making in aligning citizens with the policy goal to improve collective human welfare. We map Kauffman's NKC fitness landscape model, a generalizable theory of co-evolutionary complexity, to the phenomenon of transparent policy making in order to explain how transparency as an enabling generative mechanism encourages citizens to align with the policy goal without exercising central control. In our framework, citizens are agents who co-evolve by adapting to information available in their citizen landscapes. These landscapes represent the citizens' decision context, which policy makers observe and modify throughout an iterative policy cycle. In our study we identify three types of transparencies that relate to three properties of the citizens' decision context: (1) individual decision interdependence; (2) decision bias; and (3) collective decision interdependence. Using conceptual modeling, a form of inquiry combining formal representation with empirical sense making in three policy domains (e-health, smart transportation, and smart energy), we articulate and empirically validate two generative mechanisms that explain transparency effects for each of the three transparencies: (1) orchestration via iterative landscape “tuning” to reduce ambiguity and simplify citizens' alignment with the policy goal; and (2) social learning via information sharing, a co-evolutionary social “nudge” that encourages citizens to be more open to behavioral changes. Our findings have implications for the literature on transparency in participatory policy making as well as the literature on complexity in public policy and public administration. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","",""

To identify their reactions and underlying considerations, we have conducted a multiple case analysis of two Norwegian organizations; a district court and a tax administration office. We conclude that public service workers are positive to digitization when it promotes professional aspects of their work and that professional discretion is considered necessary to accomplish tasks of greater complexity. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Digitalization; Digitization; Discretion; Institutional complexity; Institutional logics; Institutional theory; Public service provision",""

We have studied a city district development in Sweden where a new planning approach was implemented. The developed framework was used to analyze the complexity of this city planning process. By defining which smartness dimension each stakeholder primarily focus on and analyzing the consequences of this, the framework pinpoints each stakeholder's contribution and/or hindrance to the process and outcome. A recommendation from this study is that new stakeholder groups are important to involve in smart city planning, but this also adds complexity that must be acknowledged when setting up this kind of projects.

In this paper, we test two prominent modeling paradigms of the e-government satisfaction-trust relationship: the “service quality” model and the “expectancy-disconfirmation” model. We compare several variations of these models for their in-sample explanatory abilities, out-of-sample predictive abilities, and parsimony. To test the models, we examine a pooled, cross-agency sample of survey data measuring citizens’ experiences with and perceptions of three important and widely accessed U.S. federal e-government services—the webpages of the Social Security Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, and the U.S. Census Bureau. Our findings suggest that while the expectancy-disconfirmation paradigm performs well in explanation, a parsimonious model with an “overall quality-satisfaction-trust” link is best suited for predicting trust. In addition, the service quality paradigm offers the best compromise between predictive accuracy and explanatory power.

This study examines the role of trust and the technology adoption model (TAM) in influencing citizen intentions to adopt iVoting, and whether a social identity perspective may play a role in this individual decision process. The study is based on the integrated trust and TAM model. TAM posits that people choose to adopt a new Information Technology (IT) because they perceive it to be useful and sometimes also because it is perceived as easy to use. Trust plays a central role in building that sense of perceived usefulness in cases where the IT is a conduit to the trusted party, as we propose for iVoting. In support of this social identity extension to the trust and TAM model, our results show that citizens’ perceptions that they share the same values as the individuals affiliated with providing eGovernment (and internet-based voting) services are especially instrumental. The perception that the agency is made of “people like me” is associated with increased trust in the agency, which in turn is associated with increased levels of other factors that contribute to the intention to vote electronically over the internet.

From the perspective of mimetic isomorphism, the study examines ISS innovation by the South Korean government to elucidate organizational factors affecting organizational changes. This study attempted to investigate the interrelation of institutional influences and internal organizational factors in the course of ISS innovation. A research model was developed to elucidate the effects of mimetic isomorphism on innovation-supportive culture, legitimacy, and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB); furthermore, the relationships among innovation-supportive culture, legitimacy, and OCB, as well as how they influence organizational ISS effectiveness, were examined. A survey was administered to 489 civil servants working for the South Korean national government; valid data were analyzed using the partial least squares method. The results showed that mimetic isomorphism positively affected both innovation-supportive culture and legitimacy in ISS innovation. However, mimetic isomorphism influenced only individual OCB, not organizational OCB. Consistent with our hypotheses, innovation-supportive culture, legitimacy, and OCB positively influenced ISS effectiveness, whereas organizational cynicism negatively influenced ISS effectiveness. These findings provide interesting insights into how ISS innovation for e-government can be viewed within institutional theory and organizational behavior. As this study's results show the appropriateness of ISS innovation-supportive culture for ISS effectiveness in the government, the government should diagnose cultural manifestations or cultural artifacts to help ISS practitioners formulate, implement, and manage ISS strategies. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Information system security for e-government; Innovation-supportive culture; Legitimacy; Mimetic isomorphism; Organizational citizenship behavior",""

To protect the privacy of data owners and the security of these data, the Malaysian government has enforced the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) in 2013. Several studies found that Malaysians have low awareness of the PDPA. Prior literature also shows that the framing of news stories by the media has significant influence on public awareness and perception toward a covered topic. In this paper, we investigated how the Malaysian newspapers frame the PDPA news. We extracted a total of 793 news articles between January 1st 2010 and July 31st 2015 from ten local English newspapers. The results show that newspapers in general have not given the PDPA enough attention considering its potential impact on data privacy and security. Nonetheless, newspapers do publish significantly higher number of PDPA articles after the enforcement period compared to before the enforcement period. The newspapers also mostly position the PDPA news in the Technology section. The results also show that more PDPA news originated from foreign sources compared to local sources or the government. Our findings provide insights into the coverage patterns of local newspapers and the insufficient level of prominence given to the PDPA.

The recent trend is the administration empowering citizens to create public value by themselves, through socio-technical systems that bring data, services, technologies and people together to respond to changing societal needs. Such systems are called “platforms” and the trend is called “platform paradigm”. The aim of this article is to offer a conceptual framework for citizen-administration relationships under the platform paradigm. While existing models of citizen-administration relationships mainly focus on specific types of relationships, e.g. citizen trust versus administrative transparency, or citizen satisfaction versus administrative performance, the proposed framework identifies a comprehensive set of relationships that explain how decisions by citizens or administration and the policy environment mutually agreed by them contribute to shaping such relationships and building individual and collective capacity for pursuing sustainable development. The framework comprises 15 types of relationships organized along the four governance paradigms. It is illustrated through the analysis of 11 case studies published in the current issue.

We argue that political trust serves as a mechanism to reduce uncertainty in circumstances where civil liberties are in jeopardy. Building on different theoretical perspectives, we examined whether trust is more relevant to the acceptance of surveillance policies for citizens with high or low levels of information about those policies. Using survey data from a German research project on surveillance, we estimated the effects of political trust and policy-specific information on acceptance of surveillance. Whereas political trust fostered the acceptance of these policies, information about surveillance alone did not affect the acceptance of surveillance in any way. Estimating the interaction between political trust and policy-specific information showed that political trust was particularly important for surveillance policy evaluations of well-informed citizens. Thus, we did not find evidence that individuals compensated for informational constraints by relying on political trust. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Germany; Information; Political trust; Public opinion; Surveillance",""

Rapid advancement and changes in EEE technology, resulting in faster obsolescence of working products, are escalating the quantum of e-waste. Policies and legislations on e-waste management are evolving to control this global problem of increasing e-waste. In many countries, even the assessment of generation of e-waste is proving to be a challenge. The major constraints in applying available methodologies for e-waste assessment are related to availability, reliability and completeness of data. We analysed certain prevailing e-waste management policies and guidelines and also procedures regarding the procurement of EEE. This paper presents a justification of why a system for managing information related to EEE could facilitate more efficient management of e-waste. The justification relies on the following facts observed: 1) The sector comprising government departments and public establishments is the bulk consumer of the majority of EEE quantity, 2) E-procurement systems exist in government agencies, but are not completely centralised, 3) EEE consumption data is not maintained in a uniform manner across the sector, and 4) consumption data is not linked to e-procurement systems and disposal data. In addition to the justification, the paper identifies mandatory coding (indexing) requirements to facilitate the implementation of such a system.

Especially when there is a national security alert, anti-government rumors can become weapons that thwart government crisis information management. A key element for any government's successful cyber-rumor management is to understand what makes citizens prone to engaging in cyber-rumors. We focus on citizens' cyber-rumoring tendency that arises within the larger context of a nation's governance over the Internet. Specifically, this study examines how citizen's assessment of government Internet surveillance influences their engagement with cyber-rumors during a homeland security threat. Two surveys in South Korea find that citizens' government Internet surveillance concerns increased their cyber-rumor sharing intention, and the effect was particularly significant during the period of homeland security threat. This paper reconsiders the efficacy of government Internet surveillance in mitigating cyber-rumor propagation among general public, and expands the discussions by introducing the logic of ‘distrust effect’ on cyber-rumoring. Cyber-rumor monitoring through government Internet surveillance can be counterproductive to homeland security efforts unless government aligns its surveillance policy with citizens' informational norms on cyberspaces. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Citizen distrust; Cyber rumor; Governance over cyberspace; Government Internet surveillance; Homeland and National Security; Information policy",""

Yet, most of these studies have focused exclusively on the communication strategies and messages sent by crisis responders. Surprisingly little research has been done on how crisis publics (i.e., those people interested in or affected by the crisis) use social media during such events. Our article addresses this gap in the context of citizens’ Twitter use during the 2011 riots in the UK. Focusing on communications with and about police forces in two cities, we analyzed 5984 citizen tweets collected during the event for content and sentiment. Comparing the two cases, our findings suggest that citizens’ Twitter communication follows a general logic of concerns, but can also be influenced very easily by single, non-crisis related events such as perceived missteps in a police force's Twitter communication. Our study provides insights into citizens’ concerns and communication patterns during crises adding to our knowledge about the dynamics of citizens’ use of social media in such times. It further highlights the fragmentation in Twitter audiences especially in later stages of the crisis. These observations can be utilized by police forces to help determine the appropriate organizational responses that facilitate coping across various stages of crisis events. In addition, they illustrate limitations in current theoretical understandings of crisis response strategies, adding the requirement for adaptivity, flexibility and ambiguity in organizational responses to address the observed plurivocality of crisis audiences. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Citizens’ comments; Crisis; Crisis communication; Police; Social media; Twitter",""

More specifically, we examine whether the presentation format of a given popular report has different value to users. Our analysis is based on earlier works performed in relation to reporting formats in the private sector.

The questionnaire was answered by a sample of 165 respondents. The findings show that the website format outperforms the traditional ways of a popular report presentation in the majority of aspects examined. Therefore, this study provides collaborative evidence that the use of ICT as a means of making popular reports more attractive and useful to citizens would yield positive results with possible spillover effects to democratic participation. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Citizens' interest; Information technology; Local governments; Popular reporting; Reporting formats",""

We analyzed these short texts to evaluate how accurately Twitter represented the public opinion and real world events of significance related with the elections. We also analyzed the behavior of over a million distinct Twitter users to identify whether the platform was used to share original opinions and to interact with other users or whether few opinions were repeated over and over again with little inter-user dialogue. Finally, we wanted to assess the sentiment of tweets by both candidates and their impact on the election related discourse on Twitter. Some of our findings included the discovery that little original content was created by users and Twitter was primarily used for rebroadcasting already present opinions in the form of retweets with little communication between users. Also of significance was the finding that sentiment and topics expressed on Twitter can be a good proxy of public opinion and important election related events. Moreover, we found that Donald Trump offered a more optimistic and positive campaign message than Hillary Clinton and enjoyed better sentiment when mentioned in messages by Twitter users. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Behavior analysis; Elections; Political discourse; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Twitter",""

Smart cities contribute to social stability and economic prosperity by encouraging and enabling corporations to invest their resources and expertise in the cities, and by providing more prosperity and contentment for their citizens. Smart city services provide citizens with an improved living environment and increase their overall quality of life. Since the citizens are the users of the services, it is vitally important that their ideas and perspectives are taken into account during the planning and management of such services. This study surveyed citizens in Taiwanese cities that had all participated in the Intelligent Community Forum smart city campaigns at least once. The findings reveal that citizens are willing to accept and use ICT-based smart city services if the services are designed with innovative concepts that secure their privacy and offer a high quality of services. The more they use the services, the higher the quality of life achieved. The only factor that does not influence citizens' acceptance and usage of ICT-based smart city services is their city engagement. The study contributes to the academic literature and also provides practical pointers for cities and technology suppliers embarking on smart city initiatives. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","City engagement; Information communication technology; Privacy; Quality of life; Service quality; Smart city",""

These include inequality, poverty, corruption and migration, as well as climate change, loss of habitat and the ageing society. A conceptual framework for open governance systems enabled by ICT is proposed, drawing on evidence and examples from around the world as well as a critical appraisal of both academic and grey literature. The framework constructs a system of open assets, open services and open engagement, and this is used to move the e-government debate forward from a preoccupation with lean and small governments which ‘do more with less’ to examine the potential for open governance systems to also ‘do more with more’. This is achieved by enabling an open government and open public sector, as part of this open governance system, to ‘do more by leveraging more’ of the existing assets and resources across the whole of society, and not just within the public sector, many of which are unrealised and untapped, so in effect are ‘wasted’. The paper argues that efficiencies and productivity improvements are essential at all levels and across all actors, as is maximising both public and private value, but that they must also be seen at the societal level where trade-offs and interactions are required, and not only at the individual actor level. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Government as a platform; Open assets; Open engagement; Open governance systems; Open government; Open services; Public value",""

Leveraging this mature infrastructure, Taiwan and other leading implementers have begun to explore ways to harness IT innovations beyond efficiency to also alter how government delivers services and solves public problems. Accordingly, Taiwan's fourth e-government strategy includes a notable commitment to “proactive” service and information delivery. The aim is to flip the service delivery model by shifting from the “pull” approach of traditional e-government—whereby the citizen must seek out government services—towards a “push” model, whereby government proactively and seamlessly delivers just-in-time services to citizens shaped around their individual needs, preferences, circumstance, and location. The article explores Taiwan's implementation of this new approach through three case studies. From this, the authors extract common trends and characteristics to articulate a consolidated framework for Proactive e-Governance based on citizen-centricity, data-driven personalization, and the empowerment of frontline civil servants.

This study, therefore, argues that next to general requirements: we also need to collect context-specific user requirements for open data platforms. We take different societal issues as the starting point for open data platform design. To illustrate the value of this context-specific approach, we apply scenario-based design methodology in the Province of Groningen in The Netherlands. The results show that different scenarios result partly in similar but also partly in different user requirements, leading to a deeper and richer understanding of user requirements. We conclude that a context-specific approach thereby connecting data, users and societal issues can be used to guide government agencies and designers in efforts to develop open data platforms that actually meet the needs of citizens. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Open data platform; Scenario-based design; Societal issues; User requirements",""

Drawing on the analysis of four cases of IT-related project collaboration, we put forward that the degree of sharing of decision-making power and of accountability between government and non-government actors is critical to developing different types of adaptive governance. Findings show that the distribution of decision-making power and of accountability can be decoupled, resulting in three types of adaptive governance – namely polycentric, agile, and organic governance. We contribute to research by detailing and empirically testing the notion of adaptive governance in a digital government context, and to practice by highlighting the role of the distribution of decision-making power and of accountability in devising adaptive governance strategies. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Accountability; Adaptive governance; Decision-making; Digital government",""

It advances existing work by studying municipal level government actors in a new communications environment where social media now play an important part. Grounded in agenda setting theory, our analysis identifies police departments’ social media issue priorities, analyzes the responses of their audiences to those communications, and directly compares followers’ own conversation priorities with the police agenda. Our data set includes all the content from the Facebook and Twitter accounts of five similarly sized and demographically situated police departments in the U.S., plus all the tweets and posts from the followers or friends responding to those accounts over a 90-day period. We performed both manual coding and machine cluster analysis to elicit major threads of conversation. In addition to the data analytics, we conducted interviews with the five police departments to understand the similarities and differences in agenda priorities resulting from their social media goals and use. The study shows the priorities that comprise the police agenda, identifies both similarities and differences in what their audiences communicate among themselves about most frequently in the public safety domain relative to the police agenda, and finds evidence of positive response from the public to some of the agenda priorities communicated by the police. Our data also reveal that police are using social media interactively, which could, over time, advance community policing goals.

This article is the first to directly explore the ‘cost limit’ often included in Access to Information regimes, where requests can be refused by a Public Authority on the basis of an estimate that it would take too long to locate and extract the requested information. The validity of such estimates is particularly important in light of electronic information systems where search times are dependant upon technological expertise. This article presents a qualitative study of decisions made by the United Kingdom's Information Commissioner, where decision notices concerning the ‘cost limit’ are examined to identify technological errors. These technological errors were found to arise from specific practices of the Commissioner in 40% of cases where an estimate of the Public Authority was accepted. The author demonstrates that the concept of estimating the time taken to find information from an electronic information system is an objectively inappropriate means for estimating the burden placed on a Public Authority. Through the use of mathematics, it is demonstrated an estimation regime based on the volume of information requested is more appropriate as an alternative. From a wider regulatory perspective, this article also demonstrates that it would be highly desirable for Access to Information regimes to be regulated alongside data protection concerns, given the strong overlap in respect of the relevant technological issues. © 2018 The Author","Access to Information; Human Rights; Information Rights; Information search; Science Communication",""

However, empirical studies showing the results of this strategy are limited. The present study seeks to fill this gap. The objective is to identify and explain the effects of investment in information and communication technologies on productivity of courts in Brazil. In addition to the direct relationship between technology and judicial performance, we investigate the mediating and moderating effects of technology on other drivers of judicial performance.

Secondary data refer to all state, federal and labor courts in the country, and cover a seven-year period, from 2009 to 2015. Panel data were analyzed using hierarchical regression and conditional analysis.

Drawing from information and archival studies, sociologies of secrecy and deception, and actor-network theory, we advance three frameworks to make this contribution.

This study aims to investigate the motivational factors for adopting OGD among government institutions in Saudi Arabia. A qualitative research approach was used to guide the research and the data was collected using interviews and documentation. The results of the study are interpreted and explained using elements from institutional theory. It shows that the adoption of OGD is influenced by existing institutional arrangements, and that the institutional changes that are occurring in the country such as the Saudi Vision 2030, the approval of the Freedom of information Act 2016, and anti-corruption campaigns have contributed positively to the transition from culture of secrecy to openness. In addition, the initiative is influenced by internal and external institutional pressures. Furthermore, the organizations studied perceived several benefits, which can be described as rationalized myths of the OGD such as transparency and accountability, better access to government data, support for innovation, improved government services, operational benefits and encouragement of participation.

Using the theoretical lens of public deliberation, this study investigates attitudinal and cognitive aspects of user conversations on government-managed social media accounts. Drawing on a survey of 417 users of the Chinese social media platform Weibo, our findings show that interactions on social media are mostly non-dialogical and non-creative in nature, and characterised by homophily and polarisation, even though users perceive their interactions as deliberative.

We analyse the case of the Dutch civil registry, in which hundreds of (semi-)public organisations use the information from the civil registry to determine whether people are eligible for their services. We use the framework of administrative burdens and administrative exclusion to show that this system turns the consequences of mutations in registration into a black box, produces legal contamination by forcing its own address definition upon user organisations, reduces the discretionary space of street-level bureaucrats to handle social complexity and unintended consequences of the system, and creates a behavioural incentive in which municipalities are pushed into the role of enforcers rather than registers. The result is a ‘digital cage’: an exclusionary infrastructure that hinges on information architecture instead of Weberian rules and procedures. These findings increase our understanding of master data management systems, emphasise the importance of understanding information architecture as an ethical issue, and help us develop a new vocabulary for understanding and studying administrative burdens as part of a bureaucratic infrastructure. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Administrative burdens; Administrative exclusion; Bureaucracy; Civil registry; Iron cage; Master data management systems",""

Hence, this research seeks to contribute to understanding of the nature of the digital divide as it affects Nigerian citizens, specifically users of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) web portal. The NIS portal is a rich context in which to study the digital divide: it is the most well-developed e-government service in Nigeria; its use is compulsory for citizens seeking to travel outside of Nigeria; and, its users reside within both Nigeria (a developing country) and in more developed countries, such as the US and the UK. Using an online survey, and snowball sampling, 351 completed questionnaires were collected and analysed using t-tests and Anova. The digital divide was represented in terms of the three dimensions: previous Internet experience, access to computing facilities, and previous e-government experience.

Based on a survey among 1560 heritage institutions in 11 countries, an empirically validated maturity model for the implementation of open government is presented. The model uses innovation diffusion theory as a theoretical backdrop. While the model is at odds with the unidimensional nature of the Lee & Kwak Open Government Maturity Model (Lee & Kwak, 2012), the findings suggest that the transformative processes predicted by various e-government maturity models are well at work. They result in increasingly integrated services, participative approaches and an emerging collaborative culture, accompanied by a break-up of proprietary data silos and their replacement by a commonly shared data infrastructure, allowing data to be freely shared, inter-linked and re-used. In order to put our findings into perspective, we take stock of earlier discussions and criticisms of e-government maturity models and offer a new take on the issue of stages-of-growth models in the field of e-government.

We explore whether public officials are more likely to respond to requests from citizens that are informed about their right under the RTI law vs regular citizens, as well as from influential citizens (journalists and firm owners). We also assess whether public servants’ responses to RTI requests are gender-biased. We conducted a randomized field experiment to test for unequal treatment given to citizens’ requests by Uruguayan government officials, considering different citizen categories. We find that only those citizens who know the RTI law and invoke its existence have a greater likelihood of obtaining an answer from bureaucrats. This result is driven mostly by men's requests declaring they know the law when making their request, while invoking the law doesn't make a difference in responses to women.

We explore these gaps in the literature using the hypothetico-deductive approach to research, by using general deterrence theory to postulate a series of main and moderating effects relating ICT use and corruption, and then testing those effects using secondary data analysis.

First, during the crisis situation, platform characteristics of media synchronicity and richness of expression affected the likelihood of rumor recipients believing the false rumor to be a true message. Second, rumors received from people with closer social ties were more likely to be believed as true. Third, rumor belief during the crisis was associated with greater intensity of informational and behavioral actions.

It digs into the individual pattern of adoption and use of a broad set of information and communications technologies (ICT) by introducing a conceptual model combining the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) and the five-factor model of personality. By doing so it provides insights on factors affecting technology adoption and the role of personality on individual usage behavior. Most of the UTAUT2 hypotheses are supported, with performance expectancy being the strongest predictor. Openness is a significant predictor of behavioral intention, whereas for usage behavior the significant personality predictors are openness, extraversion, and agreeableness. Moreover, as data were collected in Bulgaria and Portugal, a multi-group analysis revealed significant country differences. The effect of performance expectancy, habit, agreeableness, and neuroticism on behavioral intention, as well as the effect of age on usage, are stronger for Bulgaria, whereas the effect of hedonic motivation on behavioral intention and the effect of behavioral intention on usage are stronger for Portugal. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Digital divide, extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2); Information and communications technologies (ICT); Personality",""

Thus, we focus on a core question about analysing and guiding the development of local OGD portals. An evaluation framework is developed based on the comparison of related studies and principles. To fill the gap in existing frameworks which lack clarity in the prioritization process, Analytic Hierarchy Process together with an expert survey is used to derive priorities of elements of the framework. To test the capability of the framework in analysing and guiding the development of local OGD portals, a case study of Chinese province-level OGD portals has been carried out. Results show that data accessibility and quality matter more than data quantity for a local OGD portal. Currently, Chinese province-level OGD portals are in their infancy of development, with a great gap between Taiwan and Hong Kong with other portals. Data relating to local statistics, credit records, and budget and spending are well released on portals in China. Population size and the size and wealth of the local government show no significant relation with the number of datasets. By combining priorities of the framework with evaluation results, it could help local governments to recognise their present shortcomings and give them recommendations for recognizing directions for OGD portal's future development. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Analytic hierarchy process; Data evaluation; Evaluation framework; Local government; Open government data; Open government data portal",""

Specifically, a greater level of political competition is associated with a more favorable regulatory response for sharing companies such as Airbnb. This finding is explained using the concepts of governmental status quo bias and adaptive governance. When considering the interests of the public and market incumbents, governments generally favor the latter (i.e., the status quo). This is because single-industry economic interests can more easily be organized into interest groups that can influence policymaking through lobbying. However, a greater level of political competition was found to reduce the power of entrenched market incumbents.

Analysis of consumers’ transactional data helps organizations to understand customer behaviors and preferences.

This paper proposes and tests a Privacy Boundary Management Model, explaining how consumers formulate and manage their privacy boundary. It also analyzes the effect of the five dimensions of privacy policy (Fair Information Practices) on privacy boundary formation to assess how customers link these dimensions to the effectiveness of privacy policy. Survey data was collected from 363 customers who have used online banking websites for a minimum of six months. Partial Least Square results showed that the validated research model accounts for high variance in perceived privacy. Four elements of the Fair Information Practice Principles (access, notice, security, and enforcement) have significant impact on perceived effectiveness of privacy policy. Perceived effectiveness in turn significantly influences perceived privacy control and perceived privacy risk. Perceived privacy control significantly influences trust and perceived privacy.

The literature on government use of social media has noted that these platforms provide a variety of democratic functions for government institutions, in their ability to increase transparency and citizen participation. However, there is less recognition and understanding in this context about the symbolic and presentational content governments communicate on social media. This is the case despite the fact that social media are tools for self-presentation, the exchange of symbolic content, and marketing. We have conducted a literature review from diverse sources, including e-government, business, human-computer interaction, social psychology and human communication to develop a typology of government communication on social media. We present a classification scheme with 12 specific categories and discuss the potential purposes of these various types of communication. Via empirical content analysis, we code a total of 2893 Facebook posts of local governments across the U.S., in a pilot and in a confirmatory study. This analysis allows us to better understand the categories of communication and the extent of their presence. Although we find that most content on local government Facebook pages falls into the category of democratic information provision, almost half of all messages refer to symbolic and presentational types of information exchanges.

This is achieved through case study research, based on collaborations between the Swedish Forest Agency and external communities that were intended to co-create value. The collaborations were supported by an IS environment, comprising two IS artifacts that has been in use for several years. The analysis was based on sociomaterial boundary object theory. The philosophical framework underpinning the investigation of the interplay between technological and social aspects of the IS-enabled co-creation processes, i.e. the collaborations, was critical realism. The purpose of this article is, therefore, to analyze the co-creation processes supported by the IS artifacts (viewed as boundary objects) and to consider the outcomes, in terms of value co-creation and co-destruction, of the collaborations.The results show that value is both co-created and co-destroyed in the collaborative processes. The main conclusions are: (i) it is difficult to define value co-creation and co-destruction when the boundaries between collaborating communities are complex; (ii) when boundaries are complex, collaboration requires complex IS artifacts; (iii) the risk of co-destruction outcomes increases with boundary complexity. Finally, the article demonstrates that sociomaterial boundary objects provide a suitable theoretical framework for investigations of value co-creation and co-destruction through IS artifacts in e-government. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","",""

The basic assumption is that once data are more discoverable, accessible, available in alternative formats, and with licensing schemes that allow free re-use, diverse stakeholders will develop innovative data applications. Despite OGD's potential transformative value, there is limited evidence for such transformation, particularly due to scarce data use, which is partly attributable to the lack of technical skills and user training. To advance the dialogue around methods to increase awareness of OGD, improve users’ skills to work with OGD, and encourage data use, the paper compares and contrasts how three training interventions in Spain, Italy, and the United States have sought to increase awareness of OGD, improve users’ skills and potentially engage them in their use of OGD. We report three main findings. First, introduction and analysis skills are taught in combination to encourage use of open data. Being aware of OGD and its benefits is insufficient to promote use. Second, OGD training seems to be more effective when complemented with knowledge about context and interactions with government. Finally, embedding the training interventions in the specific contexts and considering the unique characteristics, interests, and expectations of different types of users is critical to success. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Citizen engagement; Information literacy; Open government data; Open government data skills; Open government data users; Training programs",""

Research studies have shown that the smart city system primarily focuses on integrating three components: economic, environmental, and social. The social component includes participatory democracy with citizen engagement. In many cases, smart cities focus on discovering answers for various urban problems through the adoption of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) designed to collect citizen feedback, or provide knowledge resources that can improve the quality of urban life. However, there are very few studies that attempt to close the information loop and link problems to solutions in one, unified framework. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate such a unified approach. Using the theoretical lens of dynamic capabilities, we expand the definition of a smart city to include the notion of an urban organization with dynamic capabilities, which operates within cycles of 'sense’, 'seize’, ‘align’, and ‘transform’ functions. Our case study focuses on the 'sense’ and 'seize’ steps, describing a medium-size city in Texas, where an open-ended survey is used as a collection instrument for citizen input and concept-based analytics are employed to convert such input into actionable insights.

In particular, there have been a growing number of OGD establishments in the developed world, sparking expectations of similar trends in growing democracies. To understand the readiness of OGD stakeholders in Africa especially the media, this paper (1) reviews current infrastructure at OGD web portals in Africa and (2) conducts a preference elicitation analysis among media practitioners in 5 out of the 7 OGD country centers in Africa regarding desired structure of OGD in developing countries. The analysis gives a view of the relative importance media practitioners ascribe to a selected set of OGD attributes in anticipation of a more functional OGD in their respective countries. Using conjoint analysis, the result indicates that media practitioners put premium on ‘metadata’ and ‘data format’ respectively in order of importance. Results from the review also reveal that features of current OGD web portals in Africa are not consistent with the desired preferences of users. Overall, the study provides a general insight into media expectations of OGD in Africa, and also serves as a foundational knowledge for authorities and practitioners to manage expectations of the media in connection with OGD in Africa. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Conjoint analysis; Developing countries; Open Government Data (OGD); Preference modelling; The media; Web portal",""

By the latter half of the 20th century western liberal democracies, driven by right-to-know movements, slowly moved away from secrecy towards more openness of government through public access to its information. Australia, with a series of reforms beginning in the late 1970s, declared in 2010 that government information was a national resource, and public access was the default position. This paper, by providing a history of the Australian Commonwealth legislative and regulatory reforms, their impetus and interpretations, explores the ebb and flow of openness and the intended and sometimes unintended, consequences for traditional government secrecy. Using the complete freedom of information datasets made available by these reforms, the paper presents an insight into government attitudes to openness by providing access to its information. These datasets also enable research into government and bureaucratic actions to pushback against these reforms for pragmatic or ideological reasons. The paper concludes that although there continues to be worrying vestiges of secrecy, on balance, Australia has achieved much in countering a culture of secrecy and the delivering more openness of government. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Freedom of information; Open government; Privacy; Right to know; Secrecy",""

Some early episodes of this social movement can be traced to the early 1990s.This paper presents a historical case study of such an OGD episode, a campaign targeted at a government database called JURIS, initiated by OGD advocates in the early 1990s. JURIS was a legal information retrieval system created by the Department of Justice and used by government employees, which contained federal court decisions (or case law), among many other primary legal materials. Public interest groups and small publishers intended to open up the database for public access and data reuse, but their effort failed and eventually led to the shutdown of the JURIS system. This paper provides a detailed account of the history, analyzes the reasons of the failure, and discusses outcomes of the campaign.

We found that state governments that had adopted OGD policies earlier had active policy entrepreneurs (or lead departments/agencies) responsible for the policy innovation diffusion across the different government departments. We also found that their efficacy ranking was relatively high in terms of OGD portal openness when openness is measured by the greater number of datasets proactively and systematically published through their OGD portals.

Although cybersecurity is one of the most important challenges faced by governments today, the visibility and public awareness remains limited. Almost everybody has heard of cybersecurity, however, the urgency and behaviour of persons do not reflect high level of awareness. The Internet is all too often considered as a safe environment for sharing information, transactions and controlling the physical world. Yet, cyberwars are already ongoing, and there is an urgent need to be better prepared. The inability to frame cybersecurity has resulted in a failure to develop suitable policies. In this paper, we discuss the challenges in framing policy on cybersecurity and offer strategies for better communicating cybersecurity. Communicating cybersecurity is confronted with paradoxes, which has resulted in society not taking appropriate measures to deal with the threats. The limited visibility, socio-technological complexity, ambiguous impact and the contested nature of fighting cybersecurity complicates policy-making. Framing using utopian or dystopian views might be counterproductive and result in neglecting evidence. Instead, we present evidence-based framing strategies which can help to increase societal and political awareness of cybersecurity and put the issues in perspective. © 2017 The Author(s)","communication; cyber war; cyberphysical society; cyberphysical system; cybersecurity; evidence-based policymaking; framing; information security; Internet of Things",""

With samples drawn from 433 IT project participants in Semarang municipal government, Indonesia, this research finds that leadership style is a major predictor of decision structure used in government IT projects. Decision structure, in turn, influences IT project success. Specifically, participative decision structure is positively associated with project success, whereas hierarchical decision structure hurts project performance. Empowering leadership is positively related to participative decision structure, while transactional leadership is positively related to hierarchical decision structure, and laissez-faire leadership is positively associated to specialized decision structure. Finally, team competence moderates the relationship between hierarchical decision structure and project success so that when team competence is low, hierarchical decision making is less negatively related to project success versus when team competence is high. Our findings contribute to the theoretical discourse of garbage can theory by extending it to include leadership style as a key predictor of decision structure in organized anarchy.

Government policy in this matter is wrapped in the rhetoric of public accessibility, that is, it must be easy to find, to access and to use. This paper draws upon a case study to explore the validity of this rhetoric; it uses Pierre Bourdieu's concept of society as a metaphorical game in which different players, government and citizens, play with different rules, a situation that can result in mismatches and conflicts in expectations and beliefs. Societal understanding of accessibility to government information is more nuanced and multidimensional than accessibility as an institutional practice within government departments, and requires high levels of digital and civic literacies. The case study findings demonstrate that accessibility did not meet the expectations of a group of university students who were both digitally and civically literate but were not able to find documents mandated to be published. The research concludes that there is a gap between the assumptions of the providers of government information and the expectations of their users; this disparity raises issues of social justice that will need to be bridged if government policies for online information delivery are to fulfil their objectives and rhetoric. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Accessibility; Australia; Civic literacy; Digital literacy; Government websites; Open government",""

We validated the evaluation framework by applying it to compare two cases of Italian OGD datasets: an internationally recognized good example of OGD, with centralized disclosure and extensive data quality controls, and samples of OGD from decentralized data disclosure (municipality level), with no possibility of extensive quality controls as in the former case, hence with supposed lower quality.Starting from measurements based on the quality framework, we were able to verify the difference in quality: the measures showed a few common acquired good practices and weaknesses, and a set of discriminating factors that pertain to the type of datasets and the overall approach. On the basis of this evaluation, we also provided technical and policy guidelines to overcome the weaknesses observed in the decentralized release policy, addressing specific quality aspects. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Data quality measurement; Empirical assessment; Government information quality; Open data quality; Open Government Data",""

First, organizations themselves tear down their walls and make their gateways more porous because it pays off in terms of better agility and responsiveness - they can do more, faster and better. Second, technological developments increasingly destroy walls from the outside as computation becomes cheaper for attackers, and the implementation of cyberwalls and gateways becomes more complex, and so contains more vulnerabilities to be exploited by the clever and unscrupulous. Third, changes in the way humans and technology interact, exemplified (but not limited to) the Millennial generation, blur and dissolve the concepts of inside and outside, so that distinctions become invisible, or even unwanted, and boundaries become annoyances to be circumvented.

Current research suggests that social media adoption in government has been mainly market driven and that the various adoption strategies have resulted from a combination of trial and error, imitation, and both informal and formal knowledge exchanges. Given the nature of the adoption process and the nature of social media, the use of social media in government involves high levels of risk and uncertainty, and the main barriers of adoption lay in the organizational and institutional arrangements of government organizations. Nevertheless, little or no research has looked for the ways in which government organizations design strategies or use social media. In this paper, we open the black box to look at the process of adoption and implementation of social media in a government-lead social marketing program to promote healthy habits among young people living in urban areas, the Puebla Sana (Healthy Puebla) program. The case suggests that commercial social media, such as Facebook, Youtube, or Twitter, are instances of sociomaterial systems, and to take advantage of their features, government organizations need to collaborate with multiple individual and organizational actors in the co-creation of a message to accomplish their goals. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Assemble view of technology; Electronic government; Mexico; Social marketing; Social media; Sociomateriality; Web 2.0",""

More specifically, the authors describes the various characteristics of smart work users and analyzes the effects of antecedents on the intention to use, and the usage behavior of smart work using the first nation-wide survey of smart work in the public sector. The findings reveal that the level of diffusion of smart work appears to be low in terms of number of the users. However, younger workers who have lower positions and shorter job tenures and workers in quasi-governmental organizations show relatively high levels of intention, and actually use smart work more frequently than other employee groups. Structural equation modeling shows that the perceived costs of commuting and business trips, work productivity and efficiency, and institutional and technological support have positive effects on smart work adoption by public employees. In contrast, social isolation and lack of communication, and unfriendly leadership and management associated with smart work have negative effects. Moreover, the intention to use smart work has a mediating effect on the relationships between the drivers/constraints and the usage behavior of smart work.

They bring with them a variety of meanings for OGD. The purpose of this paper is to show how the different stakeholders and their different perspectives on OGD can be analyzed in a given context. Taking Chile as an OGD exemplar, stakeholder analysis is used to identify and categorize stakeholder groups in terms of their relative power and interest as either primary (in this case, politicians, public officials, public sector practitioners, international organizations) or secondary (civil society activists, funding donors, ICT providers, academics). Stakeholder groups sometimes associated with OGD but absent from significant involvement in Chile – such as private sector- and citizen-users – are also identified. Four different perspectives on open government data – bureaucratic, political, technological, and economic – are identified from a literature review. Template analysis is used to analyze text – OGD-related reports, conference presentations, and interviews in Chile – in terms of those perspectives. This shows bureaucratic and political perspectives to be more dominant than the other two, and also some presence for a politico-economic perspective not identified from the original literature review. The information value chain is used to identify a “missing middle” in current Chilean OGD perspectives: a lack of connection between a reality of data provision and an aspiration of developmental results. This pattern of perspectives can be explained by the capacities and interests of key stakeholders, with those in turn being shaped by Chile's history, politics, and institutions. Overall, stakeholder analysis and perspectives analysis are shown from this case to be workable techniques for OGD that add value by exposing the identity, power, motivations, and worldview of key actors. They provide a necessary foundation of knowledge for both researchers and practitioners who need to understand the different meanings of OGD in any particular context. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Chile; Open government data; Perspectives analysis; Stakeholder analysis",""

It adopts a mix methodological approach to (1) examine citizen demand for access to information and government compliance with FOI laws and (2) explore structural and political conditions that affect demand and compliance. Results from data collected in Albania, Kosovo, and Montenegro suggest that the positive outcomes of the FOI laws are highly dependent on public demand and supervisory institutions. While FOI non-compliance can be attributed to the limited administrative capacities, the failure to put in place access structures also indicates the erosion of leadership political will during the implementation phase as a consequence of the lack of public demand.

This research verifies that the level of political institutionalization and the degree of technological development interact to affect the level of participation through ICT, and that the magnitude of this effect is different for countries with different types of online populations and different forms of political institutionalization. This implies that e-Participation has a higher probability of increase when institutions and technology act in conjunction; efforts to realize e-democracy through ICT will fail if only a technological infrastructure is considered in countries.

The most current data of the UN e-government survey (2014) show that several autocracies massively expand their online facilities. Recent studies question the widespread assumptions that such initiatives improve transparency and foster democratization. They propose the hypothesis that authoritarian regimes set up e-government as a response to globalization pressures and to demonstrate modernity and legitimacy to the international community. However, this article argues that the hypothesis does not account for the variations of e-government across different types of authoritarian regimes and suggests a refinement. The qualitative assessment of four post-Soviet authoritarian regimes points to crucial differences of how e-government is used to legitimate authoritarianism. While the non-competitive regimes of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan create their web presences primarily for an international audience, the article finds a surprising citizen-responsiveness on the websites of the competitive regimes of Kazakhstan and Russia. This article proposes a new concept of e-government in autocracies and illustrates that some type of competitive authoritarian regimes use their websites not only for gaining external legitimacy but also as an efficient tool for obtaining the support of their people by offering online services and simulating transparency and participation. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Authoritarianism; Competitive regimes; E-government; E-participation; Internal and external legitimation; Non-competitive regimes",""

Nevertheless, government agencies tend not to open their datasets and can act reluctantly to embed the concept of data publication in their daily operations. Accordingly, this study examines the determinants that are argued to have influences on the government agencies' intention and behavior of open data publication. Relevant hypotheses are developed through literature review to form a preliminary research model, and respective influences of the determinants on the government agencies' intention and behavior to publish datasets are statistically tested. The empirical results show that the determinants account for 60.4% of the variance in agencies' intention and 54.2% of the variance in agencies' behavior. All the determinants are statistically significant except for perceived effort and perceived benefits. Specifically, facilitating conditions and organizational capability are the two factors having the strongest positive effect. Perceived usefulness, external influence, and organizational culture also have positive influences while perceived risks indeed incur a negative impact on the intention. On the contrary, perceived effort and perceived benefits are found to be insignificant. Lastly, intention is statistically significant and indeed acts as a strong antecedent to predict government agencies' activities of open data publication. Practical implications are also offered to practitioners. A designated government agency should act as the coordinator to help agencies obtain facilitations from others. Agencies' concern of data misuse should be mitigated, as it is found to be the major driver having a negative impact. The limitations and future research directions are also discussed. The findings and discussions of this study are expected to contribute to the current open data literature. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Government information; Information sharing; Open data; Open government",""

These are operationalised through an enhanced Technology Enactment Framework (TEF) to consider reforms to explore the DEG environment and, specifically, the interventions of the CIO on e-government policies. We employed a case analysis approach from public sector authorities in the US States of California and Nevada with data from CIOs and other key informants. Our findings reveal how public sector CIOs adopt the role of an 'institutional entrepreneur', who demonstrate a series of initiatives augmented through identified behaviours. These relate to proactive community mobilisation (leadership, member focus) and legitimisation (discourse, success stories). We outline the policy implications of DEG and the risk factors of senior managers who enact these processes towards complex technological change.

This in turn creates difficulties when assessing the quality of ‘e-services’, as we cannot specify precisely what we are measuring. Based on a literature review, we argue that it is neither feasible nor fruitful to provide an unambiguous, precise understanding of the concept of e-service. However, in our context, ‘e-services’ is understood as a sequence of digital interactions between a service provider and service receiver which add some value to the receiver. We will accordingly inquire into the ‘e-service’ concept and examine its distinct types of communication in order to provide a better understanding of its basic characteristics. As a result, we outline a framework for categorizing the different types of digital communication that are denoted ‘e-services’ by identifying their basic service elements. This framework will also help to specify their distinct quality dimensions. We can thereby identify and model various types of interaction between citizens and public agencies based on a consistent set of service elements.

The use of the sustainability concept in the eGovernance context is an emerging area without a common focus or use of the concept. There is a lack of research with a thorough basis in sustainability theory, and a need for empirical research focusing on sustainable eGovernance. In order to respond to this need the research question of this paper is, How can current eGovernance practice be interpreted from a sustainability perspective? A case study is performed in the context of Swedish eGovernance practice, at national and municipal level. Interviews are used to investigate practitioners' views, which are analyzed by using a framework, developed based on eGovernance literature that highlights sustainability.

Increasing urbanisation and the cumulative growth of urban management issues are pressing local governments to provide valuable services. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are established as drivers of this new wave of change in the redefinition of the relationship between the city and its citizens. Smart Cities rely strongly on strategies and solutions enabled by ICTs involving directly local governments, citizens and communities. Open data alone, though a relevant component of these strategies, cannot provide enough incentives for the engagement of citizens necessary to establish a collaborative and open governance system; data need to be appropriately elaborated, communicated and used. The main objective of this paper is to investigate how open data together with simple and standardised elaborations and innovative visualisation techniques may be used to provide new and updated services to citizens and communities: free and readily available services based on the wealth of information ‘owned’ by local governments. Adopting a design science research methodology we develop and test a collaborative ICT-based tool called UrbanSense. We use it to highlight how systemic connections between citizens and city-government may be devised. On this point, the focus is on the feedforwarding of open data integrated with basic elaborations and visualisations as a means for the local government to create new and open services for citizens and communities. The use of the services prompts citizens to feedback new information in real-time to the city government. These interactions may be used to foster an open innovation ecosystem. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Citizens participation; E-government; Interactive city maps; Open data; Open government; Open innovation; Smart City",""

Therefore, more interdisciplinary research is required as eGovernment can be both hindered by and contribute to the digital divide. First research steps have already been taken, for instance by using access and socioeconomic status as representations for the digital divide. However, the digital divide discipline has developed rapidly and contemporary research findings indicate that, at least in developed countries, not access and socioeconomic status, but digital skills are important representations of the digital divide. Therefore, in order to explore new explanations in channel choice, we incorporated further developed digital skills measurements into eGovernment research channel choice measurements. Accordingly, this research explores the citizen's perspective by studying actual channel use in the Netherlands.  Results show that, surprisingly, digital skills do neither predict nor relate to choosing the online channel. However, they do predict the degree of satisfaction; the more digitally skilled citizens are, the more satisfied they are with online services. Results also show that the nature of interaction significantly coheres with channel choice: registration correlates with choosing online channels, consultation correlates with choosing offline channels.  These findings bring us to the thesis that when it comes to the uptake of eGovernment, at least in developed countries, digital skills become less relevant. However, they come into play when it concerns the perceived quality, expressed in terms of satisfaction. This could mean that, in the long run, many citizens are going to use eGovernment anyway, no matter how (un)skilled they are, no matter how complex these services are. As such, we see the emergence of a new important research question in the multidisciplinary domain of eGovernment. Namely, what are the implications of channel use for policy implementation? Because if less digitally skilled citizens are using electronic government services anyway, what happens to policy goals that heavily rely on online services? © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","",""

Although rural and urban municipalities have distinct characteristics that may affect people's attitudes toward e-government, the research thus far has not differentiated between them.

Data from eight e-enabled elections between 2005 and 2015 in Estonia, were used to investigate changes to the profile of e-voters and contrast them to those voting by conventional means. Owing to the aggregate share of e-voters increasing with each election, with one third of voters now casting their vote remotely over the internet, there was a lack of conclusive evidence regarding whether the new voting technology had diffused homogenously among the voting population, or remained a channel for the resourceful and privileged. Our findings show that diffusion has taken place, but not until after the first three e-enabled elections.

Within the public sector, smart city has become a popular term and municipal governments around the world are using multiple strategies to become smarter. However, there is no consensus about what smartness means and how to identify its key components or dimensions. Some definitions highlight information technology and data, while others pay attention to sustainability, openness, innovation, or resiliency. Based on a review of current literature, this paper identifies multiple dimensions of smartness and proposes an integrative view that highlights how each dimension contributes to the understanding and development of smart governments. We argue that smartness should be conceptualized in a broad and multifaceted way. The framework we present serves as a foundation to understand and measure smartness in government and provides guidelines for the comprehensive development of smart governments. Some of the dimensions have been identified and studied explicitly in the realm of smart government. A number of other dimensions are embedded in the literature as individual characteristics of a good government; although they are not explicitly referenced in relationship to smart government, we argue that they are important components of a government being smart. The paper also suggests that public managers do not control all dimensions equally. Some dimensions could be seen as relatively direct outputs of their actions, while others could be better understood as outcomes that could be affected, but not solely determined, by strategic interventions or deliberate actions. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Creativeness; Data; Effectiveness; Efficiency; Evidence-based decision making; Information technologies; Innovation; Openness; Smart city; Smart government; Sustainability",""

The framework is built on the basis of two recurring dimensions in research about people's concerns about privacy: one dimensions represents that people perceive particular data as more personal and sensitive than others, the other dimension represents that people's privacy concerns differ according to the purpose for which data is collected, with the contrast between service and surveillance purposes most paramount. These two dimensions produce a 2 × 2 framework that hypothesizes which technologies and data-applications in smart cities are likely to raise people's privacy concerns, distinguishing between raising hardly any concern (impersonal data, service purpose), to raising controversy (personal data, surveillance purpose). Specific examples from the city of Rotterdam are used to further explore and illustrate the academic and practical usefulness of the framework. It is argued that the general hypothesis of the framework offers clear directions for further empirical research and theory building about privacy concerns in smart cities, and that it provides a sensitizing instrument for local governments to identify the absence, presence, or emergence of privacy concerns among their citizens. © 2016 The Author","Big data; City government; Open data; Privacy concerns; Smart city",""

The problems encountered include: insufficient data quality and interoperability, problems regarding governance and motivation, lack of capabilities, and heterogeneous political and ideological agendas. A common open data infrastructure might resolve some of these problems, however, implementing such an infrastructure is a highly complex task. This longitudinal case study of the Danish Basic Data Program (BDP) is intended to improve our understanding of the challenges related to providing open access to government data through open data infrastructure. The BDP aims to improve the quality of selected government data, make them more coherent, and improve accessibility through the implementation of a common data distribution platform. The program is expected to increase government efficiency and stimulate innovation. This case study describes the evolution of the BDP and identifies the main structural elements of an open data infrastructure. Data analysis uncovered four tensions, which are identified as key challenges of an open data infrastructure implementation. These tensions are presented with four suggested governance strategies that were used in the BDP case.

This article makes a practical contribution to understand the role of living labs as intermediaries of public open innovation. The analysis focuses on the dynamics of these innovation intermediaries, their outcomes, and their main challenges. In particular, it adopts a qualitative approach (fourteen semi-structured interviews and one focus group were conducted) in order to analyze two living labs: Citilab in the city of Cornellà and the network of fab athenaeums (public fab labs) in the city of Barcelona, both in Spain. After a thorough analysis of the attributes of these living labs, the article concludes that 1) living labs provide the opportunity for public agencies to meet with private sector organizations and thus function as innovation intermediaries, 2) implementing an open innovation perspective is considered more important than obtaining specific innovation results, and 3) scalability and sustainability are the main problems living labs encounter as open innovation intermediaries. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Co-creation; Co-production; Collaborative innovation; Fab labs; Living labs; Open innovation; Open innovation intermediaries",""

Their influence has been noted in a small strand of literature, largely related to the courts, in steering the degree to which the public has access to information. This study found that business interests, particularly from the 1980s on, played a key role in shaping the FOIA by decreasing access to government-held information.

This study focused on the perceived work tasks and practices along with professional development opportunities among Korean records professionals who work in public institutions. Korean records professionals face unique challenges because public institutions in Korea hire records professionals not because of internal needs but because of the law that mandates hiring at least one records professional at each public institution; no records can be discarded without the permission of the records professional. Interviews were conducted to better understand records professionals' perceptions, challenges, and experiences on their own terms. The results reveal that records professionals who participated in this study practice in an isolated environment and are prone to develop narrow understandings of their profession.

Fortunately, computational tools can assist policy analysts in uncovering latent patterns from these large textual datasets. This study uses such computational tools to explore e-petitions, viewing them as persuasive texts with linguistic and semantic features that may be related to the popularity of petitions, as indexed by the number of signatures they attract. Using We the People website data, we analyzed linguistic features, such as extremity and repetition, and semantic features, such as named entities and topics, to determine whether and to what extent they are related to petition popularity. The results show that each block of variables independently explains statistically significant variation in signature accumulation, and that 1) language extremity is persistently and negatively associated with petition popularity, 2) petitions with many names tend not to become popular, and 3) petition popularity is associated with petitions that include topics familiar to the public or about important social events. We believe explorations along these lines will yield useful strategies to address the wicked problem of too much text data and to facilitate the enhancement of public participation in policy-making. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","E-petition; Named entity recognition; Natural language processing; Policy analysis; Textual analysis; Topic modeling; Wicked problem",""

The focus of this study is to investigate the use of information sources, communication channels and the interaction effects between these sources and channels. A quantitative survey among 1218 representatives of small and medium-sized businesses was conducted. The results show that in most cases, businesses use set combinations of channels and sources; however, driven by factors such as the exact situation, people deviate from these patterns.

This model is then applied to a longitudinal case study of the digitalization of Roskilde University Library. The theoretical and empirical analysis yields four main results. First, it is shown that the transition from a New Public Management approach towards a Networked Governance mode implies a greater distribution of knowledge and innovation across different organisational levels within public administrations. Interactions between such organisational levels crucially affect the development of new public services. Second, a more articulated view of users in public sector innovation is developed. It is argued that: (i) users play distinct roles at different stages in innovation processes, with relatively greater involvement in minor incremental changes; (ii) user-driven innovations have significantly increased with the diffusion of ICTs and Web based public services; and (iii) complex innovations are facilitated by face-to-face meetings between public servants and users. Third, it is suggested that changes in governance modes affect the balance between the different actors involved, thus influencing the nature and intensity of innovation. Fourth and finally, it is argued that the transition towards a networked governance approach requires information policies which persist over time, and are designed to increase collaboration between different (public and private) actors. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Digitalization; Governance; ICT; Information policy; Innovation; Library services; Public sector",""

Coping with these challenges requires budget-short governments to look for innovative ways to transform and improve their operations and service provisioning models. While in many cases transformation starts from the inside-out (based on policy goals) and focuses on reorganization through ICTs, we notice a different class of initiatives in which external ICT developments are capitalized by governments to transform from the outside-in. One category of ICT innovations that is especially promising for such a transformation is that of information platforms (henceforth platforms), which can be used to connect different stakeholders; public and private. Platforms are not new. Yet, there is not much research on using public-private platforms as part of a transformation effort, the (policy) instruments that are involved, nor about dealing with the cascading multi-level challenges that transformation through platforms offers. This paper addresses these knowledge gaps by drawing on empirical research embedded in two long-term endeavors: (1) standard business reporting between businesses and government agencies and (2) international trade information platforms. In both cases, platforms are being collaboratively developed and used by a collective of public and private organizations. These initiatives reveal that government agencies can steer and shape the development of public-private platforms in a way that enables businesses to pursue their own interest whilst transforming business-government interactions and more generally serving collective interests and public value. Our findings indicate that once a public-private governance structure is accepted by stakeholders and adapted to fit with the technical dimensions of the information infrastructure, even platforms that are driven by the private sector can start to evolve in a way that enables extensive transformation of the operations of government. © 2015 The Authors.","Business-to-government; Collaborative governance; E-Government; Information infrastructures; Open innovation; Platform governance; Public-private platforms; Transformation",""

A new paradigm that signifies a shift to citizen-driven initiatives over and above state- and market-centric ones calls for innovative thinking that requires openness in government.

This paper uses sociotechnical systems theory and a review of open data research and practice guidelines to develop a preliminary ecosystem model for planning and designing OGD programs. Findings from two empirical case studies in New York and St. Petersburg, Russia produced an improved general model that addresses three questions: How can a given government's open data program stimulate and support an ecosystem of data producers, innovators, and users? In what ways and for whom do these the ecosystems produce benefits? Can an ecosystem approach help governments design effective open government data programs in diverse cultures and settings? The general model addresses policy and strategy, data publication and use, feedback and communication, benefit generation, and advocacy and interaction among stakeholders. We conclude that an ecosystem approach to planning and design can be widely used to assess existing conditions and to consider policies, strategies, and relationships that address realistic barriers and stimulate desired benefits. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Datasets; Dynamic model; Open data; Open data ecosystem; Open government data; Planning; Program design; Stakeholders",""

In order to clear up these issues empirically, we formulated an extended criteria model for the quantification of eGovernment maturity, analyzed the average quality of the information architecture of 31 identified Informational World Cities' official websites, and studied the processing of boundary documents, i.e. documents that serve different user groups. Our outcomes indicate that the maturity and usability levels of investigated cities are much differentiated, whereas the implementation of boundary documents in form of detailed information sheets is rather scarce. Considering the maturity of investigated eGovernments, there is still potential for improvement, especially regarding the aspects of communication and transaction services. The differences between the eGovernments' usability standards are substantial and the results are partially suboptimal.

The second is the underlying assumption that citizens rationally assess their situation and based on the task at hand choose the best fitting service channel. In this article we challenge both assumptions. We review the work on channel choice and rationality in decision making. Based on this review we propose and empirically test a model combining different determinants and decision making processes. Our findings show that citizens sometimes choose channels rationally and sometimes irrationally. The task at hand, personal characteristics, and situation trigger which factors are most important.

This view thus argues that polarization would not be especially problematic on these outlets.

Current e-Participation literature is replete with fragmented models, which only partially describe aspects of e-Participation with main focus on structuring the “e-Participation” concept as a domain. This has made consistent descriptions and comparative analysis of e-Participation initiatives difficult, thus hindering the overall evolution of e-Participation. Consequently, no comprehensive, formal, executable e-Participation Ontology exists, that could be directly leveraged to facilitate operations of e-Participation initiatives or improving communication and knowledge exchange between similar e-Participation initiatives. In addition, current generation of e-Participation models does not explicitly support the emerging phenomenon of spontaneous, citizen-led e-Participation, in particular hosted on the social media platforms. This work bridges this gap by providing a practical, yet sufficiently detailed, conceptualization along with corresponding formal and executable ontology for next generation e-Participation. These semantic models cover the core facets of e-Participation — as a democratic process, an initiative and a sociotechnical system.

Together with VDAB, we apply an Action Design Research (ADR) approach to develop a simple rules strategy specific for VDAB's context, which we call a set of “boundary breaking rules”. Coining these rules represents a first significant step in VDAB's journey towards achieving a radical business innovation. In addition to the main artifact specific for the VDAB context, i.e., the “boundary breaking rules”, we derive design principles concerning the nature of this artifact. This paper aims to lay the foundations for a more broadly applicable design theory of simple rules, useful in contexts generalizable from the specific VDAB context. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Action design research; Boundary breaking rules; Digital era governance; Simple rules",""

It reviews literature in e-government and design research in order to generate an answer to this research question. The result of this review affirms that the policy character of e-government should determine the way that such design research is conducted. A tentative e-government design research model, consisting of different activities is formulated. This model consists of the following activities: theorizing, policy analysis, workpractice analysis, co-design and co-evaluation of IT artifact and workpractice. Three specific e-government design research principles are formulated: The policy principle, the co-design principle and the theorizing principle. One important result from this paper is the formulation of the concept of the policy-ingrained artifact as an important empirical outcome from e-government design research. A design research case study on social welfare allowances has been used for the generation as well as the validation of the proposed e-government design research model. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Co-design; Design research; Design science; Design theorizing; E-government; Information system; IT artifact; Policy",""

The storage and analysis of this information benefits society, as it enables relevant agencies to make better informed decisions and to address the individual's needs more appropriately. Members of the public often assume that the authorities are well equipped to handle personal data; however, due to implementation errors and lack of data governance, this is not always the case. This paper reports on an audit conducted in Western Australia, focusing on findings in the Police Firearms Management System and the Department of Health Information System. In the case of the Police, the audit revealed numerous data protection issues leading the auditors to report that they had no confidence in the accuracy of information on the number of people licensed to possess firearms or the number of licensed firearms. Similarly alarming conclusions were drawn in the Department of Health as auditors found that they could not determine which medical staff member was responsible for clinical data entries made. The paper describes how these issues often do not arise from existing business rules or the technology itself, but a lack of sound data governance. Finally, a discussion section presents key data governance principles and best practices that may guide practitioners involved in data management. These cases highlight the very real data management concerns, and the associated recommendations provide the context to spark further interest in the applied aspects of data protection. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..","Case study; Data management; Data protection; Governance; Public sector",""

In emerging democracies, during political crises or controversial elections, reliable information is often difficult to obtain. In authoritarian regimes, citizens' perceptions of information reliability are tightly linked to trust in government, and both are typically low. Open government policies help build trust that is essential during protests or contentious elections. Uses and gratifications (U&G) theory states that people use diverse media to try to satisfy their need for reliable information. Gratifying this need is tied to the larger concept of political information efficacy (PIE), i.e., the belief a person holds about him/herself as being politically informed and competent to participate in political thought and action. We investigated these inter-related concepts by administering a survey to an opportunity sample of young adults at a public state university in Mexico. We find that respondents perceived that information from face-to-face and telephone communication with members of their social network, as well as online sources were the most reliable. Information from offline sources, such as TV and newspapers, especially pro-government sources, were the least reliable. Further, the information factors of availability, reliability, influence and sharing had positive relationships with PIE. These results suggest that in conditions of uncertain political information, social networks and online information sources are essential to political information efficacy and democratic political participation.

As the direct transfer of open innovation methods from the private sector to the public sector is not possible, it is necessary to develop effective ‘citizen-sourcing’ methods, which address the specific needs of the public sector, and then analyze and evaluate them from various political and management sciences' perspectives. This paper makes a two-fold contribution in this direction: i) It evaluates a novel method of monitoring relevant social media (e.g. political blogs, news websites, and also Facebook, Twitter, etc. accounts) by government agencies, by retrieving and making advanced processing of their content, and extracting from it external knowledge about specific domains of government activity or public policies of interest, in order to promote and support open innovation; ii) For this purpose it develops a multi-perspective evaluation framework, based on sound theoretical foundations from the political and management sciences, which can be of wide applicability; it includes three evaluation perspectives: a political perspective (based on the ‘wicked’ social problems theory from the political sciences), a crowd-sourcing perspective (based on previous management sciences research on crowd-sourcing) and a diffusion perspective (based on Roger's diffusion of innovation theory from management sciences). The above evaluation provides interesting insights into this novel method of promoting and supporting open innovation in the public sector through social media monitoring, revealing its capabilities and strengths, and at the same time its problems and weaknesses as well, and also ways/interventions for addressing the latter. © 2016","",""

This paper focuses on the factors that lead to e-government project failures. It explores the context of project failure and investigates the launch of the U.S. Healthcare.gov website. This case is concerned with a highly public e-government project failure where gaps between political agendas and planning are identified through an examination of media sources and social media data analysis of Twitter discussions. The finding of the analysis indicates that e-government users react against failures, while e-government projects will impact and attract opinion makers' attention that influence audience behavior.

In this citation analysis, abstracts were examined. Results: Drawing on a dataset containing articles aggregated via Altmetric Explorer, a querying interface provided by Altmetric LLP, content analysis was used to 1) determine the distribution of federal statistics incorporated in scholarly studies, and 2) qualitatively understand the particular ways in which studies incorporated federal statistics. It was found that the dominant source of federal statistics was the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), followed by the Census Bureau, and then the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Prevalent qualitative themes underlying the studies in this dataset included mortality and population studies, linked datasets, international studies, and critical studies (i.e. presenting alternative measures for federal statistics). Conclusions: When querying studies referencing one or more of the principal US statistical agencies in Altmetric Explorer, almost all studies in the final dataset cited these agencies because they had cited federal statistics. This finding need not have been the case however. A separate study on the use of federal statistics in scholarly research will compare altmetrics to traditional citation analysis.Preliminary results from Google Scholar, using traditional citations, found non-dataset publications to be the most frequently cited titles from NCHS and the Census Bureau. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..","Altmetrics; Citation analysis; Content analysis; Government information; Statistics",""

The Indian Government suggested the requirement of developing a healthcare framework for providing easily accessible, affordable healthcare and universal health coverage to all citizens in India. The Health Management Information System (HMIS) at Tamil Nadu was conceptualized in response to this requirement as a case of architectural correction from the manual to a unified healthcare system covering more than 74. million people and 2000 plus healthcare institutions in the state. The system consolidates state-level data in real time, links all health institutions, and makes it possible to track individual health indices. This data is used for planning healthcare, managing drug inventory, and planning health initiatives at the state level. We study the modified enterprise architecture (EA) of Tamil Nadu Health Management Information Systems (TNHMIS) and its comparison to existing EA approaches and operating models. We also discuss the high-level core diagram, the key elements of business processes, IT infrastructure, shared data and customer interfaces and how they are linked.

Using as evidence the focus and evolution of this focus over the period 1994-2013 in a vast body of literature produced by academia, international organisations and practitioners, we show that: a) the deployment of e-government was for a long time concentrated on more technological and operational matters and that only more recently attention switched to broadly defined institutional and political issues (hypothesis 1a); and b) institutional and political barriers are one of the main factors explaining lack of e-government adoption (hypothesis 1b). A decision making process that is still unstructured, untrustworthy, and not fully leveraging the available evidence hinder the perception of public value and citizens' trust in government, which contribute to low level of e-government adoption. We conclude suggesting that a smart government producing public value is grounded in a triangle of good decision defined by politics, values, and evidence and that to achieve it public sector should go beyond the traditional concept of service innovation. It should rather introduce conceptual and systemic innovation pertaining to a new way of thinking and of interacting with stakeholders and citizens as sources of both legitimacy and evidence. © 2014.","Adoption; Barriers; E-Government; ICT; Policy-making; Public value; Smart government",""

Although several models have been proposed to assess the success of e-government services through measuring users' satisfaction levels, they fail to provide a comprehensive evaluation model. This study provides an insight and critical analysis of the extant literature to identify the most critical factors and their manifested variables for user satisfaction in the provision of e-government services. The various manifested variables are then grouped into a new quantitative analysis framework consisting of four main constructs: cost; benefit; risk and opportunity (COBRA) by analogy to the well-known SWOT qualitative analysis framework. The COBRA measurement scale is developed, tested, refined and validated on a sample group of e-government service users in Turkey. A structured equation model is used to establish relationships among the identified constructs, associated variables and users' satisfaction. The results confirm that COBRA framework is a useful approach for evaluating the success of e-government services from citizens' perspective and it can be generalised to other perspectives and measurement contexts. © 2014 .","COBRA; E-government service; Performance measurement; Scale development; Structured equation modelling; Users' satisfaction",""

The goal is to maximize the bang-per-buck from available funds by looking at incremental upgrades to existing infrastructure in under-served areas and incremental infrastructure build-outs in un-served areas. The strategy is to encourage competition between broadband providers whether they are wireless providers or wireline providers.In essence this is a zero-based budgeting strategy in which the FCC begins with a clean slate and takes no account of existing allocation of funds. This strategy, while it sounds reasonable in theory, threatens to bankrupt rural local exchange carriers (RLECs). As a result, it threatens not only universal broadband availability but also basic voice service. We show the devastating financial effects of this zero-based budgeting plan on RLECs using revenue, demand and cost data from a survey sent to RLECs, as well as data available from the FCC economic model, which projects the likely technology winner at the county level and the amount awarded.The FCC has acknowledged that a flash cut in funding is not feasible. Instead, it has proposed freezing support per access line during a transition period. We show that this supposed glide path to the new support mechanism also produces devastating financial results for RLECs.Tests for RLEC financial distress include comparisons of support under current programs compared to support under the new CAF, change in RLEC free cash flow and RLECs' eligibility for Rural Utility Service loans. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Connect America Fund; Free cash flow; National Broadband Plan; RLEC; Telecommunications; Times Interest Earned Ratio; Universal service reform",""

This paper seeks to explore ""how to understand conflicts that occur when developing and implementing supranational TIS."" Understanding conflicts can help TIS managers to take proactive, rather than reactive, measures to handling conflict situations that they encounter. We propose a multi-level conflict management framework and utilize an interpretive case study methodology to demonstrate how it can be applied in the context of one supranational TIS (a transit system that was introduced in the EU), taking the management perspective of one national government (here the Netherlands). Our findings indicate that the national government simultaneously faces multiple conflicts as it is positioned between the supranational body, its own IT department, and national businesses. Unlike TIS studies reporting avoidance as a viable strategy in the early stages of TIS development, our study implies that when the deadline approaches, there is little room for avoiding conflicts; rather, they are faced and addressed promptly.

Political participation is at a greater disadvantage than non-political activities in that participants from different parties already start out with established differences, which requires them to reach some form of common ground before progress can be made. Those seeking authentic deliberation are discouraged to participate when confronted with uncivil and inflammatory rhetoric. These issues are often exacerbated in online discussions, where lack of identity cues and low barriers to entry can lead to heightened incivility between participants, often labeled as ""flaming"" and ""trolling"". This paper explores the extent to which moderator systems, tools online discussion forums use to manage contributions, can reduce information overload and encourage civil conversations in virtual discussion spaces. Using the popular website Slashdot as an example of sound moderation in a public discourse setting, we found that users move toward consensus about which and how comments deserve to be moderated. Using these findings, we explore how transferable these systems are for participation in public matters specifically to the unique attributes of political discussion. Slashdot's political forum provides a comparison group that allowed us to find quantitative and qualitative differences in political posting, comments, and moderation. Our results show that large scale, civil participation is possible with a distributed moderation system that enables regularly lively debates to be conducted positively because the system provides tools for people to enforce norms of civility. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Deliberation; Human-computer interaction; Moderation systems; Politics; Public administration; Social media",""

Intentionally focused on citizen-centricity, away from bureaucratic perspectives that most typologies have taken, this typology is derived from marketing and service science literature. The proposed typology consists of four dimensions: mode of technology (automate-informative-transformative), purpose of service (hedonic-utilitarian), service authority (voluntary-mandatory), and delivery mode (passive-interactive). This typological framework is validated with a qualitative exercise of classifying inventories of actual smart city services in practice into the framework. Exercise results revealed that the categories provided are mutually exclusive and comprehensively exhaustive in general, and useful in further conceptualization of new services by identifying gaps in reality. In practice, this typology would be useful in positioning specific smart city service under development in terms of citizen-centricity. Urban planners and administrators may use this framework in understanding the pattern of their service development. Also, this framework may provide a useful guideline for service designer pinpointing the design characteristics of old and new smart city services from the perspective of users and customers of city services: citizens. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Citizen-centricity; City services; Intelligent city; Service typology; Smart city; Ubiquitous city",""

However, a few studies have focused on online civic and political activities with political efficacy such as posting factual information for other citizens, working for a political party, or sending e-mails to local government officials since the beginning of the internet. Thus, this study explores the relationship between internal/external political efficacy and online civic/political activities. In addition, to understand the multidimensional relations, other psychological factors such as the level of trust, extroversion and community collective efficacy are also examined. In this study, the National Science Foundation Digital Government Survey of 2005/2006 and 2012 were used. By using the Hierarchical Regression Model, this study found different patterns between measures of efficacy such as internal/external political efficacy including community efficacy and offline/online civic/political activities. Related to offline civic and political activities, the external political efficacy was positively associated with those activities. Meanwhile, in online activities, the internal political efficacy was more strongly related than the external one. In other words, individual citizens who have higher internal political efficacy may use the internet more as an imperative communication channel to reach elected officials or public servants. Furthermore, community collective efficacy is positively related with both offline and online civic activities.

In this article we explore the variation in OSS adoption among Dutch local administrations. The Dutch central government adopted a policy to stimulate the use of OSS in the public sector, but the non-mandatory character of the policy resulted in great differences in the degree of adoption of OSS at the local level. Using data from a new survey of municipalities in the Netherlands and proportional odds statistical models to analyze the data, we show that the degree of OSS adoption crucially depends on the presence of boundary spanners and political commitment within the local government. On the other hand, oft-suspected factors like financial stress and jurisdiction size have no discernible effects. Our findings have implications for understanding the spread of OSS in the public sector and for public policies designed to encourage OSS diffusion. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Boundary spanners; Diffusion of innovations; E-Government; Open source software",""

It then suggests some points to consider for policymakers and for future research to more deeply understand this unique and little-studied aspect of e-government implementation. By understanding the impacts of implementing statutes on the poor, policymakers can develop a deliberately inclusive strategy that leverages technology to support access to assistance in measurable models that can be implemented at the federal, state, and county levels.

But the unique contribution of types of mobile phone devices has not been well distinguished in the overall relevance of ICT. This paper makes a theoretical and empirical case for exploring these relationships in the context of South Africa, a country where mobile technology plays a uniquely prominent role in society. Using multivariate regression analysis with data from the Afrobarometer Survey it compares the direct effect of basic mobile phones and smartphones on civic engagement and its behavioral opposite, civic deviance. The paper then tests the interaction effect of mobile phone technology with an important construct in democratic theory: the relationship between social capital and civic behavior. The results of the analysis show that the use of mobile phone technology can cut both ways, increasing both civic engagement and deviance. However, when moderated with social capital, mobile phone use is strengthened only in its effect on civic engagement, while the effect on deviance is made insignificant. This suggests that there is a complementary socio-technical process at work for positive civic behaviors involving mobile phones and social capital.

Post-hoc analysis via ten interviews with social activists was conducted to further examine their perceptions on trust towards institutions.

Furthermore, no suitable framework for comparing open data policies is available, as open data is a recent phenomenon and is thus in an early stage of development.

The framework includes the factors of environment and context, policy content, performance indicators and public values. Using this framework, seven Dutch governmental policies at different government levels are compared. The comparison shows both similarities and differences among open data policies, providing opportunities to learn from each other's policies. The findings suggest that current policies are rather inward looking, open data policies can be improved by collaborating with other organizations, focusing on the impact of the policy, stimulating the use of open data and looking at the need to create a culture in which publicizing data is incorporated in daily working processes.

A new theory, developed and tested in this paper, explicates the effect of political efficacy on creating greater citizen-centric e-governance. Its propositions state that the higher citizens' perceived self-efficacy in political knowledge and the higher citizens' perceived fairness of government procedures and outcomes, the more engaged citizens would be in using technology for better governance and the more vocal in their views on NSA surveillance programs. This paper adopts a multi-method research approach to examine citizens' approval/disapproval of NSA surveillance programs: (1) critical discourse analysis of tweets exchanged among citizens and interest groups in Twittersphere and (2) logistic regression analysis of survey data collected from a random sample public opinion poll of Americans. The findings of both analyses provide evidence that citizens hold strong views toward NSA surveillance programs. These findings indicate that government needs to be more efficacious in communicating about surveillance programs more transparently to garner greater citizens' approval for its surveillance programs. The findings also provide preliminary evidence for good explanatory power of the theory of citizen-centric e-governance. The theory explains effectively the relationship between government practicing greater political efficacious behavior and citizens engaging in more citizen-centric e-governance in governing government surveillance programs for a better balance between security and privacy. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Citizen-centric e-governance; Critical discourse analysis; E-government; Government surveillance; Logistic regression analysis; Public opinion; Twitter",""

The purpose of the measuring was to assess and compare IS practices around the globe as well as share best practices. A number of measurement tools have since been developed, and a number of previously constructed tools have been employed to fulfil this goal. Even though many variations in terms of indicators have been employed, the construction of measurement tools is subject to certain limitations. One limitation is that they do not incorporate these indicators on the actual levels of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) usage off the country's stakeholders. This paper analyses the most currently used indices for measuring the state of Information Society building from the perspective of their constituent indicators. Based on the analysis, an alternative framework for IS measurement, addressing the important aspects of ICT usage quality, is developed based on data from the EU member states. By applying the framework on measuring of ICT usage quality at Romania, Cyprus and Estonia, the usefulness is tested positive, and the need to evaluate the actual levels of ICT usage for the purpose of better policy-making, while establishing an information society, is accentuated. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","(Actual levels of) ICT usage; (Responsive) information society (building); Digital divide; E-readiness; ICT usage index; Networked Readiness Index; World Summit on the Information Society",""

Quick Response codes (QR codes) provide a means to effectively distribute many different varieties of information to the public. We propose to integrate QR code systems and corresponding smartphone applications into existing government services with the goal of providing a new level of interactivity for the public. We illustrate this through two case studies, examining the National Park Services and the Mobile Environmental Information Services (MENVIS). The focus is on developing a QR code waypoint system for park navigation, as well as incentivizing park use through gamification of site attractions. The system provides increased safety for park goers, disseminates information more effectively and accurately, and improves feedback. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Location-based information services; Mobile government services; QR codes; Smartphone services",""

Comprehensive integration requires a future-oriented perspective so investment is made in robust and flexible solutions meeting not only today's demands but also sustainable to meet those of the future. This paper addresses the use of the sustainability concept in eGov research. We discuss definitions and elements of sustainability and conduct a structured review of eGov literature investigating how various sustainability areas (social, economic, environmental and technical) are addressed. We find 21 overall themes in 94 papers, with the highest number in the ""social"" category. Two cross-cutting themes to which 21 overall themes relate are also identified; Decision-making and Infrastructure. Findings show that sustainability is mainly addressed narrowly, focusing on projects rather than general issues, and shallowly with a focus on single factors rather than the complex interaction among them, and with little foundation in sustainability theory.

In this environment smartcards represent a strategic instrument to link citizens to public administration and local infrastructure to further advance on smart city plans. This research proposes a theoretical model and present privacy and security as key drivers of citizens' intentions to continue using smartcards. The functional benefits (i.e. usefulness and ease-of-use), the level of personal interaction with local services, and the direct and moderating effects of socio-demographic variables complete our framework. The findings of an empirical study with smartcard users in Zaragoza (Spain) show usefulness and security as the main antecedents of continuance intentions. In turn, the influence of socio-demographic variables is not significant, which suggests that smartcards should focus on a wide-range of users. These results offer interesting implications and recommendations for public managers such as the need to guarantee the security of the transaction system and to expand the number of services and initiatives relaying on the smartcard service in order to gradually develop the smart city transformation. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Continuance intentions; Privacy; Public services; Security; Smart city; Smartcard",""

Particularly, influential determinants from type comparisons and government agencies are identified and discussed regarding what agencies may take into considerations when selecting certain types of information sharing. While there is no single type of information sharing that can satisfy all the needs and concerns of government agencies, most agencies still simultaneously employ several types of information sharing in different circumstances. A competition-and-cooperation relationship exists among the different types of information sharing in both dimensions. The paper suggests that a balance between centralized and decentralized types of information sharing should be achieved to obtain advantages and diminish disadvantages.

We found indications that socio-economic characteristics of citizens do not influence the willingness to participate in open government projects-contrary to findings in other forms of government participation-and therefore open government opens a great potential for enlarged citizen engagement. Our survey also indicates that open government projects with lower ambitions result in more participation than more ambitious projects, which implies that considerable steps need to be taken to realize the full potential of open government. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Citizen ideation; Citizen sourcing; Collaborative democracy; Open government; Open government engagement motivation; Open innovation",""

This paper adapts an existing framework for information sharing and integration to the complex environment of financial market regulation (FMR) to present an argument for the criticality of effective cross-boundary information sharing to financial regulators seeking to establish robust governance of financial markets. The framework is then used to outline the challenges to information sharing and integration in FMR and to help model the related information flows. Current literature and a recent study of information sharing in FMR are used to identify key actors in FMR information sharing relationships to outline the challenges faced in this unique context and the resulting risk if these challenges go unaddressed.

However, the appropriate programmatic mix remains an open question, since little empirical analysis has actually assessed the degree to which a lack of infrastructure is responsible for this 'digital divide.' In this article, information on broadband adoption from 2011 Current Population Survey data are meshed with detailed broadband infrastructure data from the newly available National Broadband Map.

In particular, web 2.0 tools and social media applications have recently played a significant role in influencing government decision making and shaping the relationships between governments, citizens, politicians, and other social actors. After the Arab Spring and the uprisings that have led to significant political changes in Egypt, Tunisia, and Iran, commentators argue that information technologies have the potential to strengthen social movements and ultimately transform society. However, this influence is not new. There were movements in the 90s, using the new technologies of e-mail and websites, which were able to gather significant social attention and generate political pressure. Based on three Mexican social and political movements that span close to 20. years, this article identifies key similarities and differences in the use of information technologies and proposes a framework to understand the evolution of cyberactivism. Initially, activists used information technologies to promote a movement's main ideas and gain global support. More recently, a single tool or application, such as Twitter, has been the technological basis for certain social and political movements. However, there is a trend towards a more integrated use of social media tools and applications, generating what could be called cyberactivism 2.0. In addition, there are some distinguishable stages in the development of social protests using information technologies; this evolutionary model seems to be useful to understand very different social and political movements using very different levels of technological sophistication. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Cyberactivism; E-Democracy; E-Politics; EZLN; Iam132; Online activism; Social media",""

While governments may seek to conceal plans for impending conflict, they must spend large sums of money mobilizing and equipping soldiers in preparation for deployment. Thus, examining government spending patterns might yield insight into future military conflict. This article reports on an attempt to explore the possibility of using open U.S. Department of Defense (D.O.D.) contracting data to identify patterns of spending activity that can predict future military engagement. The research in this article followed a two-stage method. The first stage involved the exploration of the research question in the context of a specific case, the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. The second stage assessed the open government contracting data used in the research and classified data and systems problems that were encountered according to an established analytical framework for open data barriers. The analysis demonstrated that the use of U.S. D.O.D. contracting data to predict future war has promise; however, a number of problems with the data and online portal prevented the derivation of conclusive, generalizable results. These problems were related to the open data barriers of task complexity and information quality.

With an increasing number of anonymous crime reports being filed and digitized, it is generally difficult for crime analysts to process and analyze crime reports efficiently. Complicating the problem is that the information has not been filtered or guided in a detective-led interview resulting in much irrelevant information. We are developing a decision support system (DSS), combining natural language processing (NLP) techniques, similarity measures, and machine learning, i.e., a Naïve Bayes' classifier, to support crime analysis and classify which crime reports discuss the same and different crime. We report on an algorithm essential to the DSS and its evaluations. Two studies with small and big datasets were conducted to compare the system with a human expert's performance. The first study includes 10 sets of crime reports discussing 2 to 5 crimes. The highest algorithm accuracy was found by using binary logistic regression (89%) while Naive Bayes' classifier was only slightly lower (87%). The expert achieved still better performance (96%) when given sufficient time. The second study includes two datasets with 40 and 60 crime reports discussing 16 different types of crimes for each dataset.

Government benefits from broad participation in collective decision making in terms of sustainable outcomes (e.g., greater consensus) and quality of life in our cities and communities. These collective decision making capabilities are undermined by a strange combination of diminishing (or extinct) local print media, especially local newspapers, and by its obverse, a plethora of information and communication opportunities that are scattered across numerous disparate and decentralized websites and resources (e.g., webpages, RSS feeds, social network software, email, listservs, podcasts, tweets).

Electronic government is presented as a promising reduction strategy in many countries. Underlying assumptions and mechanisms are hardly ever made explicit and scientific evidence of successful implementations is scarce. This paper presents an assessment of business-to-government systems in use in the Netherlands. Results show that organizational characteristics are the most influencing factors of perceived burden reduction and implementation effectiveness. Whereas perceived organizational benefits positively relate to the overall confirmation of the former system adoption decision. Surprisingly the quantitative, usage related characteristics do not present any statistical relevance. These findings help us understand existing differences in appreciation between business and governmental representatives on the successfulness of e-government projects in reducing the administrative burden on businesses. Furthermore, research results can help to enhance the effectiveness of e-government policy and measurement instruments. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Administrative burden reduction; Business-to-government information systems; Effectiveness of e-government policy; Information obligations; Measurement instruments",""

Based on a dataset of 1746 posts by 81 local government Twitter accounts during or shortly after the riots, we explore how local authorities attempted to reduce the effects of the riots and support community recovery. Using Twitter's conversational and rapid update features, they produced a variety of informational and actionable messages with clear calls for offline or online action.

Increasingly, public libraries fulfill this role. Instead of direct government-to-user interaction, government information and services flow through channels from agency to public librarian to user, from user back up to agency, and from agency to user to public librarian.

While transparency and interactivity features of government websites constitute two critical elements for public participation and democracy facilitated by web-based technologies, little research has been done to explain why some public organizations choose to deploy website technology more openly with these features. This paper aims to examine the managerial, organizational, and environmental factors that are related to variation in transparency and interactivity features of local government websites, which we believe are key dimensions to governmental website openness. The paper first develops a literature informed conceptual model of governmental website openness and then tests this model using data from a national survey of 850 government managers in 500 cities. The model results are compared across three different departments: community development, finance, and police department. Overall findings indicate that higher website openness is positively related to increased frequency of public participation in agency decision making and civil society influence, increased technical capacity, lower organizational control, and higher perceived usefulness of website technology. In addition, due to differences in the operating contexts of the departments, the effects of organizational control, technical capacity, environmental influences, and perceived usefulness of website technology on governmental website openness tend to differ by the type of department. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Accountability; Government website openness; Local governments; Open government; Public participation; Transparency; Website technology",""

There is growing consensus that governance mechanisms must complement access to technology to achieve greater impact on development. However, few or no rigorous research exists to show how such mechanisms can support the delivery of mobile services to vulnerable groups. This study fills this important gap by first providing a conceptual framework, based on the Choice Framework and the Structuration Theory, to elaborate on the relationship between ICT, governance and citizen capabilities. Second, the framework is applied to analyze livelihood needs of 45 women head porters interviewed in Accra. Third, as all women under study have access to mobile phones, we determine which governance mechanisms are needed to support the delivery of mobile services to them. Results show that three governance mechanisms enable the contribution of mobile technology to meeting the livelihood needs of this group: 1) updating financial and telecommunication regulations to enable the provision of mobile-based services e.g. mobile microfinance, to vulnerable groups; 2) mobilizing local communities in the production of local contents; and 3) engaging non-governmental organizations in building capacity of government agencies in mobile service delivery and in training vulnerable communities in effective use of mobile technology to access information and services critical to their needs.

Integration in government is complicated, as evidenced by a discouraging project failure rate. An often quoted reason is that the complex relationships among government, society, and technology which come into play when integrating multiple organizations are not fully understood. This paper addresses this gap by scrutinizing a large national integration project asking, what is the nature and causes of the conflicts that surface during implementation? Data was collected by means of participant observations and narrative interviews. Seven major conflicts were found, all general because they involve basic values which were in conflict with each other. The values were specified by legislation and strictly operationalized in various government institutions which, consequently, were in disagreement about what was legal and desirable. The findings show that in order to achieve interoperability a ""re-operationalization"" of these values is necessary. These changes cannot be clearly defined upfront but must be ""negotiated"" by means of practical achievements that are considered important enough to motivate gradual changes in the way we implement our values in legislation and practices. This means that ambitious integration projects must serve as spearheads in such value change, which is a root cause for delays and even failure. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","EGovernance; EGovernment; Electronic health records; Integration; Interoperability; Values",""

We also address whether the adoption of social media portends a move by local governments from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0.The findings of this research show that the principal drivers of local government adoption of e-information and services are highly consistent with those of previous research: size of government, type and form of government, region of the country, education, years of e-government experience, and the existence of a separate IT department are all related to adoption. The drivers of adoption of e-transactions are consistent, but somewhat less so, with prior research. And, the drivers of adoption of social media are closer to those of e-information and services than of e-transactions.Based on evidence from the survey (local governments use social media mainly for one-way communication) and prior studies of IT and government and e-government, we conclude that social media today do not appear to be moving local governments in the direction of Web 2.0, but perhaps in the direction of Web 1.5. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","E-democracy; E-government; Local government; Social media",""

In response to the Open Government Directive, U.S. federal agencies developed their open government plan and launched numerous social media-based public engagement initiatives. However, we find that many of these initiatives do not deliver the intended outcomes due to various organizational, technological, and financial challenges. We propose an Open Government Maturity Model based on our field studies with U.S. federal healthcare administration agencies. This model is specifically developed to assess and guide open government initiatives which focus on transparent, interactive, participatory, collaborative public engagement that are largely enabled by emerging technologies such as social media. The model consists of five maturity levels: initial conditions (Level 1), data transparency (Level 2), open participation (Level 3), open collaboration (Level 4), and ubiquitous engagement (Level 5). We argue that there is a logical sequence for increasing social media-based public engagement and agencies should focus on achieving one maturity level at a time.

The paper points to the public value paradigm as an alternative approach to studying ICT-enabled public sector reforms. This paradigm, we argue, proposes an alternative way of framing the nature of the problems faced when ICT enabled public sector reforms are initiated and studied. The public value perspective proposes a new and richer context in which to study and research these phenomena. It also calls for the redefinition of the ways we assess e-government in the context of public sector reforms. It is therefore seen as vital to evaluate the socio-political impact of ICT adoption in the public sector. © 2012.","E-Government; ICT; NPM; Public sector reforms; Public value",""

Governments in many parts of the world have invested vast resources into electronic government projects with the expectation of achieving these and other outcomes. However, the results in many cases are limited and there is no comprehensive way to evaluate these initiatives at the aggregate level. A method for measuring and evaluating electronic government that identifies its advances and problems is needed.

Findings reveal patterns of social media tool application for particular purposes, although organizations do not all use social media tools in the same way. Moreover, regression analysis shows that different organizational factors - work characteristics, innovativeness, technology and management capacity and stakeholder influence - predict each of the four technology-task couplings - social media for dissemination, social media for feedback on service quality, social media for participation, and social media for internal work collaboration.

Based on an extensive review of relevant literature, five hypotheses are formulated and five factors are identified (i.e., security and privacy, trust, accessibility, awareness of public services, and quality of public services) that may affect the Jordanians' level of satisfaction towards using the Jordan e-Government portal (www.jordan.gov.jo). Survey data from 400 employees in four universities in the northern region of Jordan were collected and used to test the proposed hypotheses. Based on multiple linear regression and factor analyses, our empirical analysis demonstrates several key findings. These findings indicate the usefulness and importance to unveil the key drivers of e-Satisfaction so as to provide feedback in a set of recommendations that will enable creating e-Government portals which are compatible with citizens' needs, desires, and expectations.

Additionally, the criteria and guidelines that councils are using to define 'vexatious' are also examined. The approach taken to the research in this study is a survey of the 32 councils in Scotland using freedom of information requests as the data collection method.The findings from the survey revealed that none of the councils were keeping records of costs relating to FOI requests. However, 80% were keeping records of numbers of requests. One third of authorities that kept records of 'vexatious' requests had experienced such a request. However, the actual number of 'vexatious' requests received were extremely low, suggesting that the negative perception of the legislation as wasting taxpayers' money through the submission of playful and vexatious queries to councils was misleading and inaccurate.From a practical perspective, the findings highlight the difficulties in recording cost data and the general lack of record keeping within organisations, suggesting some national guidance and coordination on the issues may well help make councils more efficient. The increasing numbers of request for information since the legislation came into force suggests that it has been successful in opening up councils to public scrutiny. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Cost of freedom of information; Exemptions; Freedom of information; Vexatious requests",""

The multidimensional structure of the WEQ was tested in a controlled laboratory setting and in an online real-life setting. In two studies we analyzed the underlying factor structure, the stability and reliability of this structure, and the sensitivity of the WEQ to quality differences between websites. The WEQ proved to be a valid and reliable instrument with seven clearly distinct dimensions. In the online setting higher correlations were found between the seven dimensions than in the laboratory setting, and the WEQ was less sensitive to differences between websites. Two possible explanations for this result are the divergent activities of online users on the website and the less attentive way in which these users filled out the questionnaire.

It ensures a more cost-efficient usage of resources while preserving a smooth flow of goods across international borders. Hence, customs administrations are challenged to favor the introduction of IT systems that may enhance the ability to improve information sharing with the business sector, as well as with other governmental agencies. This is often not a straightforward process. As many experts point out, e-Government development projects fail commonly due to the lack of thorough understanding of administration requirements as well as barriers for implementation. Hence, the purpose of this study is to understand what factors enable or hinder the exploitation of e-Customs platforms. By means of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), a theoretical framework is developed to identify drivers and barriers for usage of e-Government/e-Customs platforms. Thereby, a survey instrument was developed and data was collected in occasion of a World Customs Organization (WCO) Annual Council meeting, which was joined by around 400 customs delegates and officers from 178 WCO member administrations. A total of 94 questionnaires have been collected and analyzed, which gives an approximate response rate of 23% (46% considering only the 178 member administrations). The analysis of data has been performed by a combination of multivariate techniques and ANOVA. Results show that factors like cost-savings and ease of use significantly influence the usage of e-Customs platforms. On the contrary, cost-efficiency and usefulness of e-Customs platforms have no significant impacts. From the perspective of barriers preventing adoption, this paper identifies two main factors: 1) technical constraints and costs and 2) quality and trust. Both these factors significantly influence adoption of information sharing, in the context of business-customs communication. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Drivers and barriers; E-Customs; E-Government; Information sharing; Security; Single window; Trade facilitation",""

On the distribution of funds, we find that the PCCs supported were located in areas of high broadband availability as well as high demand: while this is contrary to the BTOP's stated purpose, we argue that it is actually more cost-effective to also target areas of high demand. It was also found that whereas a majority of PCC grants went to governmental agencies, who also received larger grants than non-governmental recipients, they were no more likely to generate a significantly higher percentage of matching funds or to move toward project completion sooner.

It is then important to define ways to evaluate their functional completeness and correction as well as their security and reliability. Many solutions to specific aspects of voting have been proposed but we do not know of any holistic view of this process. We present a unified approach to elections based on a conceptual model built using software patterns. A set of analysis patterns describe the structure and management of an election. The patterns describe voter registration, ballot structure, election day management, voting process, and the complete election. A conceptual model is built from the analysis patterns and defines precisely the functional properties of such a system together with its security requirements. The conceptual model is defined using UML diagrams that can be extended or complemented with formal methods to make the system verifiable. We show how to continue to the design phase for this system. While the model will not apply exactly to all elections it can be used as a reference architecture for voting applications and to show explicitly the security considerations for these kind of events. It can also be used for existing elections to verify that they have the required security provisions. The model can also be used as a reference for researchers to integrate their solutions in the complete process. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Democracy; E-Government; Electronic voting; Patterns; Secure elections; Threat modeling; Voting",""

Motivated by these shortcomings, the paper develops and applies a business model perspective as an interceding framework for analysis and evaluation. The underlying principle behind this approach is that it is not technology per se which determines success, but rather the way in which the business model of the technological artifact is configured and employed to achieve the strategic goals. The business model perspective is empirically demonstrated with the case of an online petitioning system implemented by a UK local authority. The case illustrates the importance of considering ICTs in public engagement from a holistic view to make them more manageable and assessable. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Case study; Citizen engagement; Digital governance; EGovernment business models; EParticipation; EPetitions; Value networks",""

Different approaches have been proposed to replace the legacy ""silo"" regulatory model. This is now a compelling issue in China, the world's largest developing country. The historical separation between telecommunications and television and the strict ""silo"" type of regulation have resulted in an asymmetric market where phone companies control the conduit and broadcasters dominate the content. However, the Chinese government has turned the convergence of telecommunication, television and internet into a national strategy. According to the State Council's ambitious plan, the Chinese government aims to achieve a competitive converged information industry and an accompanying clear, scientific and efficient regulatory regime by 2015. Drawing on the theory of fragmented authoritarianism, this paper examines China's uneven path to triple-network convergence. Theoretically, this paper complements the existing research on China's information policy, which is mostly one-shot and sector-specific, with a complete treatment of convergence policy evolution that involves both telecommunications and television. Practically, this paper finds that there are two remarkable characteristics in China's convergence policy-making, namely, the causal relationship between institutional and policy change and the consistent policy objectives, which will continue to shape to future to come.

However, mobilization of information technology in e-governance is not a straightforward instantiation of such ambitions but rather a tinkering process in which actors and their interests are combined and transformed. In this paper we examine this idea by investigating the development of a Swedish national public healthcare portal representing a complex, multilevel, and political environment. In this endeavour, the principle of symmetry from Actor-Network Theory and an event-based approach in the analysis play important roles. We show that the development process involves envisioning the future (even if vaguely), implementing concrete ideas about technological functionality and platforms, reconciling diverse interests, prioritizing and framing political concerns and breakdowns, and working toward realization of abstract goals. In this process, the technological actors play a role as important as that of the human actors. The paper concludes that e-governance relationships emerge that rest upon socio-material pragmatics influenced by political transformations that are often unanticipated. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Actor-Network Theory; E-governance; E-government; Healthcare; Materiality; Portal; Principle of symmetry",""

It calls for a sustained meta-level analysis, in which it is important to have a self-reflexive layer where we evaluate and measure how we evaluate and measure, and what the implications and the trade-offs are. The analysis justifies the call for reflexivity as a necessary step towards advancing our understanding of the impact of ICT within the Information Society domains observed. The article concludes presenting some possible ways of re-coupling the conceptual and technical dimensions of the measurement process and linking the production of measurement data more closely with impact evaluation causal models and hypotheses. It suggests that this could be achieved by refocusing on the micro level and stimulating a gradual micro-macro link through an intermediate (meso) level, which effects need to be described using different measurements and evaluation paradigms. In order to do so it is required to refine and test our theories and models to find out where it would be most feasible to scale up to the global (macro) level and to shape and inform the production of more valid measurement indicators for better informing evidence-based policy making in the Information Society. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","ICTs; Information Society; Measurement; Modelling; Policy; Reflexivity",""

Based on a literature study and two case studies we describe problems encountered in relation not only to the DSS itself, but also to the political decision process. The case studies have been carried out in two cities in Sweden that at different times but in similar situations have used DSS in order to reach a decision in complicated and contested matters. In both cases we have previously found that the method and IT tool used for decision analysis were appreciated by most participants, but the inherent rationality of the DSS was in conflict with how participants usually make decisions as well as with the political process. The assumption was that a strict and open method would make grounds for clear decisions, but the results of the decision process were none of the cases implemented. In one case the result of the decision analysis was that no clear decision was made. In the other case the lowest ranked alternative was implemented. Furthermore, in neither city the method was ever used again. We therefore ask: What are the challenges and limitations to using DSS in political contexts? Our study shows that challenges relate to selecting and using criteria; eliciting weights for criteria (high level of subjectivity); understanding all the amount of facts available in the system; time constraints; and lack of impact on the final decision. This study contributes to both research and practice by increasing the understanding of what challenges are experienced in DSS use, since the findings can be used as a framework of challenges that should be addressed, in design of systems as well as method for use. The study also contributes to understanding the role of politicians in decision-making and the consequences for the use of DSS. Further, the literature study showed that there are overall very few studies on the actual use of DSS in a political context, and we therefore conclude by encouraging more studies reporting actual use. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Challenges; Decision support systems (DSS); Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA); Political context; Public sector",""

This paper examines two different B2G information exchange architectures that reflect continuing transformations that empower some government agencies to do better compliance monitoring tasks with fewer resources. The win for the reporting companies is the lower cost of compliance. Instead of focusing on collecting compliance information from individual companies, the government agencies in this study focus on collecting information on the supply chain level, allowing for automated data reconciliation. Our findings reveal that pushing controls (automated checks) upstream (in company software and data sources) results in more efficiency, higher information quality and reduces redundant controls. The examined architectures exhibit high levels of compliance by design, meaning that many control objectives are by default encompassed in the design. This requires a well-aligned combination of data standardization (using shared syntax and semantics) and automated information processing (using an intelligent gateway between businesses and government agencies). However, achieving such an alignment is a difficult challenge; especially when taking into account that such transformations require solid governance, trust and high initial investments - prerequisites that are rare in many public-private partnerships. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Architecture; Business-to-government; Compliance by design; Continuous control monitoring; Information exchange; Standard business reporting (SBR); XBRL",""

Thus far, the e-government literature not only has paid scanty attention to web evaluation issues but also has been slow to embarking on cross-cultural research. As an attempt to address this concern, this investigation introduces an augmented approach to analyze cross-cultural website quality. The proposed approach consists of three parts: 1) a qualitative study of the website using content analysis, 2) an empirical evaluation using traditional statistical methods of perceptions of website users, and 3) a ""persuasive quality gap"" analysis that examines the gap between the composite scores of perceived importance and performance of quality attributes across the studied two cultures. These analyses were used to identify cross-cultural differences between Kuwaiti and British users' perceptions of e-government quality attributes. While the findings showed no significant differences between Kuwaiti and British users in terms of important quality features, the results revealed significant variations between the two groups in terms of perceived performance of quality attributes. Moreover, although the findings showed marginal support for the existence of differences between the two samples in terms of persuasive quality features, a post-hoc analysis of the persuasive quality gap revealed a need to consider not only important and/or high performing characteristics but also persuasive features to fully understand cross-cultural e-government quality variations.

In this respect, the author of the article argues that the open data concept realized at the local level may provide a real platform for promotion of proactive civic engagement. By harnessing collective wisdom of the local communities, their knowledge and visions of the local challenges, governments could react and meet citizens' needs in a more productive and cost-efficient manner. Open data-driven projects that focused on visualization of environmental issues, mapping of utility management, evaluating of political lobbying, social benefits, closing digital divide, etc. are only some examples of such perspectives.

However, citizens' acceptance of the services is still an issue. This paper presents a study on user acceptance of SMS-based e-government services. Constructs of the proposed model were derived from a survey on citizens' motivations for using SMS-based e-government services (142 respondents from 25 countries), prominent theories on individual acceptance of technologies, and current studies on user acceptance of SMS and e-government services. The model was validated using data from 589 citizens in three cities in Indonesia, who are non-adopters. The relationships between the factors then were compared with data from 80 adopters of SMS-based e-government services in Australia.

In South Africa extending e-government to communities has been in the form of more and/or better equipped ICT-enabled community centres, called Thusong Service Centres. In this paper, based on action research experiences, we report outcomes of interpretive research into ICT-enabled approaches to participative governance in communities. Using the Diffusion of Innovations theory as an analytic lens, the findings reveal a subtlety that is not often mentioned in the call for participative e-governance; people from communities prefer to work in groups rather than individually. The collectiveness inclination is a common denominator of many developing countries where people choose to come together to leverage the few available resources. Individuals become apprehensive when made to work on their own using the ICT. The research reveals the necessity to re-design ICT to suit small groups as part of participative e-governance rather than the normative ICT design that suits individual work styles. Additionally, the research reveals that by working in groups, communities are more willing to accept the government initiatives that are being energised with the use of ICT. Methodologically, the research revealed the ethical issue that arises from action research in its raising of unrealistic expectations in a community. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Collaboration engineering; Diffusion of innovations; E-collaboration; Multi-purpose community centres; Participative e-governance; Public service delivery; South Africa",""

The governments of emerging economies in the eastern countries especially need to adopt, without undue delay, the advanced technologies for providing better web services to their citizens. However, consideration and evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of governments' web services is currently lacking in previous literature. Thus, this study first adopts a computational approach suggested in the literature to measure the effectiveness of Taiwan's established, city- and county-level (25 cities and counties, and 1411 governmental units) governments' websites. Then, by considering the IT-related input and output resources as suggested by the experts of e-government during several in-depth interviews, data envelopment analysis (DEA) evaluates the efficiency of Taiwan's governmental web services. This study reveals that the well-developed web services provided by Taiwan's government are apparent in two geographically dispersed cities (north and south) and one county in the northern region of Taiwan. In addition, six cities and counties appear to be ineffective and inefficient in providing web services to Taiwan's citizens due to their geographical remoteness from the capital and small regional populations. An additional finding confirms the significant effect of population size on Taiwanese services for e-government in each city and county. Finally, this study suggests applying more attention to website designs for different levels or regions of governments and building alternative communication channels for citizens with different backgrounds. Consequently, providing citizens' most-requested services becomes easier, and the resources' distribution becomes effective and efficient for those in different geographical locations.

Interdisciplinary interaction of actors and integration of multiple structures during e-government adoption have made difficult for both practitioners in practice and scholars in theory. Different structuration theory (ST) models have contributed to understand this phenomenon. This article proposed an interdisciplinary structuration theory (IST) by integrating relevant structures based on a better understanding of the interacting disciplines of the e-government initiative. The IST has advantages over other models because it provides a detailed description of the case; integrates relevant structures and multiple actors' views; incorporates an alternative methodological bracketing of practices; and operationalizes the discursive consciousness. This study examines the model by using the case of an IT-enabled budget reform in Mexico as a contemporary case of e-government. An embedded case study design was employed using interviews of actors and analysis of official documents. Results show a broader set of interacting structures not just technology that were possible to identify and examine by considering other disciplines.

Guidance for improvement is created by identifying those elements that need improvements.

Given this mandate, this article sets out to provide insights from qualitative interviews with social media directors to understand the factors that influence internal adoption decisions to use social media applications, such as Facebook, Twitter, or blogs. Three distinct factors influence the adoption decisions of social media directors: information about best practices in their informal network of peers, passive observations of perceived best practices in the public and private sector, and ""market-driven"" citizen behavior. The resulting adoption tactics include: (1) representation, (2) engagement, and (3) networking. The findings point to the need for higher degrees of formalized knowledge sharing when it comes to disruptive technology innovations such as social media use in highly bureaucratic communication environments. Recommendations based on the lessons learned are provided for practitioners and social media researchers to develop social media tactics for different organizational purposes in government. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Diffusion of innovation; Qualitative network analysis; Social media adoption; Technology adoption",""

These goals have often been addressed as two interplaying outcomes of public e-service development, which are possible to achieve in parallel. This article shows that the two frequently applied stakeholders of e-government (agencies and citizens) are much too extensive and heterogeneous in order to be meaningfully addressed in public e-service conceptualization and development. We conduct a stakeholder centered analysis of a public e-service development and implementation process in order to identify stakeholder groups and discuss how they differ in their perceptions and, consequently, also in their feelings of relevance and need related to the e-service. By adopting a multi-faceted perspective on stakeholders, public e-service development can be analyzed and understood in a way that takes several stakeholder groups into account. Our study contributes with deeper insights about a situation where stakeholder salience changes over time, while some stakeholder groups have low salience during the entire process. The result of conducting a stakeholder centered analysis is that we, by visualizing the stakeholder groups' differences, are better prepared to meet and combine different needs related to a planned e-service. Thus, we argue that a stakeholder centered analysis of expectations and opinions concerning the e-service help to develop e-services possible to succeed in offering both external service and internal efficiency. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","E-Government; Public e-services; Stakeholder groups; Stakeholder salience",""

This paper investigates this claim empirically by testing the claim of convergence in social media practices in three North-American police departments (Boston, Washington DC and Toronto). The research shows that the social media strategies are widely different: the Boston Police Department has developed a 'push strategy' while the Metropolitan Police Department in DC has developed a 'push and pull strategy and the Toronto Police Service a 'networking strategy'.

Prior empirical evidence on electronic government adoption and use shapes the study's theoretical model. The model was tested via a survey completed by 1279 respondents across five community municipal portal sites in the province of Ontario, Canada. The survey polled respondents' uptake and perceptions of these portals. Cross-validation using structural equation modeling analysis indicates that information quality plays a critical but indirect role in influencing a person's use of a community municipal portal. In addition, other end-user factors, namely perceived ease of use and compatibility, also affect usage. Importantly, the need to pay attention to the information quality of community municipal portals is raised as a means of rallying citizen response to this new type of website specifically, as well as to local government websites more generally. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Community municipal portals; Electronic government; Information quality; Local government",""

Appropriate measures have also been taken to ensure that these dedicated organizations are given enough power to carry out their duties independently and credibly as a safety mechanism. In contrast, Taiwan's existing PSC inspections are administrated by commercial port authorities, causing impartiality. The disadvantages of such a system become evident when a ship is found to have critical faults, because commercial port authorities have difficulty deciding whether the ship should be detained. Under such circumstances, the impartiality and objectivity of these port authorities are often questioned. Therefore, the restructuring of port authorities to improve dedication and objectivity is a critical issue in the implementation of PSC. This research uses three stages of methodology: (1) the in-depth expert interviews aim to gather information; (2) the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) calculates the weight of guidelines and evaluates feasible solutions. Port state control officers (PSCOs), maritime transport operators, and the staffs of competent authorities are used as the respondents of this expert questionnaire; and (3) the close-loop questionnaire survey evaluates and confirms the results of the above two research processes. The objective of this research is to create the best solution for introducing an independent authority dedicated to managing Taiwan's PSC tasks. Based on the evaluation of this research study, the optimal solution is to establish an independent government agency under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC). An alternative optimal solution is to form a PSC committee under MOTC, which would serve as a temporary measure if legislation for establishing an independent government agency is delayed. These solutions would improve the PSC in Taiwan and strengthen marine transportation safety. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","AHP; IMO conventions; Port safety; Port state control",""

This has left a vacuum in terms of understanding the complexity of the challenges facing e-Government re-engineering and resultant change in public agencies. The aim of this paper is to translate the BPR movement findings to the field of e-Government induced change in the public sector. BPR characteristics and challenges are derived using normative literature and compared with two cases of public sector transformation in the UK and Netherlands. The results of these cases show that e-Government-induced change requires a plan for a radical improvement which, in contrast to BPR, is obtained by incremental steps and has a high level of participation.

Yet the implementation of new legislation is often expensive, can have long lead times and is prone to failure. The existing situation significantly constrains policy-making. To improve this, policy makers and policy executors are searching for ways to achieve higher levels of flexibility and agility in their business process management systems. Flexibility is the ability to react to changes and agility is the speed in responding to variety and change. Both flexibility and agility are multi-dimensional concepts. This paper presents principles for creating flexibility and agility when implementing new or revised policies into business processes. These principles include: 1) defining and using business services, 2) integrating and orchestrating business services through the use of events, 3) separating process, knowledge and resources and 4) implementing policy in an integrated manner. Business services are components encapsulating business functions and having clear responsibilities and accountabilities. The case study shows that these forms of flexibility and agility can help to implement policies more quickly and cost effectively. An organization's resources and level of flexibility and agility determines what laws can be implemented within a certain time. The improvement of flexibility and agility requires innovations on all levels: infrastructure, business process and organization. The level of flexibility and agility should always be measured by a combination of measures. We make plea for instruments assessing the impact of policies on organizations prior to implementation. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Agility; Business process management; Business services; Compliance; Flexibility; Policy-making; Service orientation",""

Government budgets have already been hit hard by a simultaneous increase in governmental spending and a decline in tax revenue related to a growing share of the elderly to the total population. While almost all industrialized countries can expect an aging population and resulting budget stress, the implications of the graying of society for a ""graying of e-Government initiatives and budgets"" are not readily apparent and therefore constitutes a subject worthy of investigation. Despite the increasing importance of this issue for e-Government in practice, there remains a clear need to assess our understanding and reflection of the phenomenon. Therefore, we examine (a) whether e-Government research presently provides adequate theory, vocabulary, and methods and (b) the extent to which future e-Government research is potentially able to contribute to tackling the substantial theoretical and practical challenges related to societal aging. Accordingly, we pursue a multi-method approach in terms of sequentially applying a retrospective literature review (12 journals, vol. 2000-2009) and a prospective Delphi study (involving 24 e-Government experts). The results suggest that there is currently a significant gap between actual and potential e-Government research on societal aging. We discuss the implications for future e-Government research and describe potentially fruitful ways of bridging the prevailing gap between theory and practice. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Delphi study; Electronic government; Gerontology; Literature review; Multi-method research; Research agenda; Senior citizens; Societal aging",""

These relationships could become closer and more frequent with the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). In fact, portals could be seen not only as channels for providing government information and services, but also as powerful tools to exchange information and knowledge between different social actors and government entities and to enable participation in collective decision-making efforts about important public affairs. For instance, social media and other Web 2.0 tools could provide new electronic channels for these interactions through their inclusion in local government portals. This paper argues that although important modifications to the organizational and institutional frameworks would be necessary, the potential for local electronic governance through networks of government and non-government actors via internet portals is clearly present. However, a very important first step would be the inclusion of more interaction, participation, and collaboration mechanisms in government portals. Similar to previous efforts with data from the U.S., this paper describes the results of a recent assessment of local government portals in Mexico. The conclusion is that progress toward citizen engagement is slow in local governments and there are very few efforts to increase interaction, participation, and collaboration channels on their portals. Most of them are still following the vision of information and services providers and a local electronic governance model is still in its very initial stages. It seems that e-government in municipalities is still more rhetoric and less reality, at least in some countries. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","E-governance; E-government; E-government websites; Internet portals; Local e-government; Local government portals; Municipalities",""

This research attempts to fill this research gap by addressing the following research question: Why are some businesses more willing to adopt e-Government applications to perform transactions with the government than others? The authors argue that the willingness of a business to adopt e-Government depends on the perceived quality of government services through traditional brick and mortar service channels (offline service channels), and the level of trust businesses place in the internet technology itself. Competing hypotheses are developed with regard to the role of perceived quality of offline services on the business user's willingness to adopt e-Government services.

E-government learning, which refers to the government's use of web-based technologies to facilitate learning about subjects that are useful to citizens, is relatively new, relevant, and potentially cost-effective. This work proposes and verifies that the technology acceptance model (TAM) can explain and predict usage of e-government learning. The TAM examines how perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness and their antecedents influence intention and usage of a system. This study identifies antecedents that account for individual differences, thereby enhancing the explanatory power of the built model. A survey is used to collect data from users of an e-government learning website in Taiwan. Structural equation modeling is employed to examine the fit of the data to the model. From a theoretical point of view, this research extends the TAM to e-government learning and identifies the perceived e-government learning value and perceived enjoyment as antecedents of usage of e-government learning. This study also provides directions for future research and approaches to promote e-government learning. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","E-government; E-government learning; E-learning; Technology acceptance model",""

Factors studied include the digital divide, the nature of the citizen interaction with government, public service values, and satisfaction with services received by citizens. These factors are used to determine whether they impacted choice of channel and satisfaction with that channel. This study, through logistic regression of a public opinion survey of Canadian residents, found indications suggesting a digital divide in accessing e-government; found that government websites were most commonly used for information purposes, while the phone was most commonly used to solve problems. In regards to citizens' satisfaction, the apparent digital divide was bridged when females and older Canadians were more satisfied with their contact with a government website. In addition, a positive experience with service delivery and positive public service values lead to greater website satisfaction. The results of this study imply that the phone is a more effective service channel for solving problems, and the website is more effective for getting information. Therefore, governments need to provide multiple contact channels for citizens, depending upon their task at hand, while ensuring consistency of information and service response across channels. Creating a positive experience for citizens when they received a service translates into a more satisfied experience with e-government. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Channel choice; Citizens and e-government; E-government; Survey research",""

This article demonstrates that an analysis grounded in comparative political economy can provide a compelling answer to this question. Specifically, it demonstrates that the more highly coordinated a country's economy, the less transparent it is likely to be. Through a comparison of the United States and Germany, this article argues that in coordinated market economies, ongoing negotiations between the state and the peak representative bodies provide privileged access to information about the government, and indeed privileged channels of influence over government action. Public access to official files threatens this privileged access. In less coordinated economies, however, firms lack this privileged access; they are likely to favor access laws as a partial substitute, especially since such laws are more consistent with the highly fragmented and competitive environment in which they operate. By further comparing Sweden and the United Kingdom, it also demonstrates the limits of this explanation, suggesting that historical sequences and classic political variables should also be taken into account. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Comparative assessment; Corporatism; Freedom of information; Measurement and evaluation; Path-dependence; Pluralism; Transparency",""

In this regard, the present paper examines the web visibility of South Korea's 18th National Assembly members. This study identifies those members with the highest web visibility and determines the factors affecting their web visibility by using a set of socio-demographic variables indicating web visibility. The concept of web visibility is operationally defined as the number of web mentions of each congressional member. Web mentions of the name of each congressional member were collected across many platforms, including blogs, images, news, and websites, by using a Naver search tool based on the API, and relationships between the web visibility of the members and their socio-demographic attributes (their gender, age, term, constituency, and party affiliation) were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis, Median, and Mann-Whitney U tests. The most visible politicians in the Korean webosphere had highly qualified political careers and prominence, and the difference in politicians' web visibility depended on their political attributes (their term, constituency, and party), not on their demographic attributes (their gender and age). These findings suggest that politicians who build political power and influence through their political career in the offline world are likely to be more visible in the webosphere. Further, an integrated indicator based on politicians' web visibility status can reflect their ""ubiquitous presence"" in Korea's digitalized society. © 2011.","API; Congress members; Politicians; South Korea; Web visibility; Webometrics",""

This research examines that balance in the case of electronic commerce and its relationship to state budgets and revenue raised by sales tax. Under the voluntary Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement of 2002, states can cooperate with one another and with sellers to collect sales tax on internet sales, yet only about half the states that levy sales tax have initiated this policy change. This research tests rival explanations for state membership in this interstate administrative agreement and implementation of its provisions from 2003 through 2007.

In the last two decades scholars have gradually refined the conceptualization of the digital divide, moving from a dichotomous model mainly based on access, to a multidimensional model accounting for differences in usage levels and actors' perspectives. Digital divide views tend to focus on groups of users and user characteristics and focus less on different processes of use. As models of the digital divide became more complex, research focused on deepening the understanding of demographic and socioeconomic differences between adopters and non-adopters. While IT literacy is an important factor in digital divide research, and studies examine user characteristics with respect to IT literacy, few studies make the process of basic IT literacy acquisition their main focal point (Selwyn, 2005). This perspective furthers our thinking by expanding the notion of user characteristics beyond demographic and socioeconomic differences to differences in the processes leading to internet use. Based on a dataset referring to an Italian region, this paper presents a metaphorical interpretation of the digital divide in general and explores the process of IT skills acquisition in particular. Our analysis shows the key role of self-learning and the presence of three distinct approaches in IT skills acquisition leading to different needs in terms of policy. We argue that these preliminary results are a useful starting point for the design of more effective and sophisticated digital inclusion policies. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Digital divide; ICT Governance; IT literacy; Policy",""

Survey results indicate that both the e-Government and bureaucratic paradigms impacted organizational change from CRM adoption. Factor analysis shows that management change, efficiency change, and leadership and organizational change are the three most common factors in the models.

In parallel, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) has channelized part of the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) funding to PCCs. However, BTOP funding was the result of an unprecedented economic crisis, and is unlikely to be repeated. Future programs will need to evolve criteria for selecting projects for funding that maximize their cost-effectiveness. We argue in this paper that basing funding for PCCs on broadband availability (or non-availability), is not as cost-effective as considering a broader array of factors related to demand for internet access at public computer centers. We use data on public libraries from the National Center of Educational Statistics to identify factors predicting high demand for internet access at PCCs. Based on this analysis, we argue that low demand markets may benefit more from consumer outreach and digital literacy programs, than from infrastructure deployment. Also, we argue that markets with high availability, should receive more funding if there is high demand as well, as predicted by our model. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Broadband technology opportunities program (BTOP); Community networking; Internet access; Libraries; Public computing centers; Universal broadband; Universal service",""

As government agencies increasingly collaborate with international counterparts on these issues, transnational knowledge and information sharing networks grow in importance as mechanisms for collaboration. This paper explores the nature of transnational public sector knowledge networks (TPSKNs) and identifies critical contextual factors that shape their performance. In these networks, each participating organization operates within complex national, organizational, and information contexts. The contextual differences between participants produce distances in culture, politics, intentions, organizational factors, relationships, knowledge, resources, geography, and technology. These distances influence their ability to engage in the processes and interactions that are essential to network performance. The paper concludes with a conceptual dynamic model that accounts for the relationships among these factors that can guide further research in understanding knowledge and information sharing across national and cultural boundaries. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Information sharing; International networks; Knowledge sharing; Transnational public sector knowledge networks",""

One of the key areas is related to the need to spatially evaluate the availability and deployment of broadband services, especially among urban versus rural communities. Another area of interest falls under the need for enabling broadband policies and strategies that address existing geographic disparities. These motivating factors shaped this research and provided a basis for defining three specific objectives, namely: (1) to identify locations with or without broadband access, (2) to identify underserved rural and inner-city markets, and (3) to determine whether university and community college towns can be used in the adoption and dispersion of broadband technologies in southern Illinois. Supply-side and demand-side data were collected and inputted into a Geographic Information System (GIS). Supply-side data included cable modem, digital subscriber lines (DSL), wireless, and fiber optic lines, while demand data included reported broadband requests from individuals without access (n = 439), students (n = 45,866), and higher education workforce (n = 5419). Using the GIS and statistical techniques, insightful maps of broadband infrastructure were created to illustrate areas of supply and demand so that governments and businesses can address existing gaps in consumer needs. Specifically, different levels of broadband access and use were mapped; different under-served rural and inner-city markets were identified so as to emphasize the dramatic economic impact on the business opportunities available to small business entrepreneurs. Also, different geographies of use and accessibility of broadband connectivity in the study region were synthesized to support decision-making. The resulting maps provided supply and demand marketing intelligence based on the geographic analyses of residential and enterprise sectors.

"Understanding the dynamics in e-Participation initiatives: Looking through the genre and stakeholder lenses","2011","Government Information Quarterly","108","10.1016/j.giq.2010.10.005","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79959274162&doi=10.1016%2fj.giq.2010.10.005&partnerID=40&md5=6bdeeee8f674f85632f3296e77b30f28","Conventionally, e-Participation initiatives are considered to be successful only if users use these services. While the growing body of e-Participation literature has listed and studied challenges and barriers to achieving this end, conceptual clarity on why such projects are considered as failures is yet to be achieved. We argue that this is due to the inadequate understanding of the complex stakeholder dynamics of an e-Participation project. In this paper, we seek to address this knowledge gap by proposing that using stakeholder theory complemented by genre theory provides an interpretive lens to understand the complexities in the development and use of such projects. To illustrate our proposed lens, we apply it to analyze an e-Participation project in Norway at its development and use phases. Our findings indicate that a key factor that influences the success of e-Participation initiatives is high saliency of at least one stakeholder group at various phases of the initiatives. The saliency of stakeholders changes over the life of a project and hence the salient stakeholder also varies. Consequently, it is not essential for the same stakeholder group to be salient throughout, only that some stakeholders remain salient. Our interpretive lens also extends the discourse on stakeholder theory. In traditional management literature stakeholder theory is meant as a tool to identify stakeholders' groups to which management or owner of an organization should pay attention. We show that it is also useful to identify which stakeholder groups will act to protect their interests. Based on our findings, we propose insights into studying and developing e-Participation projects. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Analytic framework; E-Government; Genre theory; Stakeholder theory",""

One major reason for non-compliance is an unforced restriction on enforcement information flow to the national environmental governance repository either due to policy regulations or, technological hindrance. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the importance of a global information technology framework for MEAs that will help in enhancing the flow of information from a grassroot level to a national repository and then serving to various international agencies involved in monitoring of enforcement and compliance to MEAs. The paper defines the current challenges in global and national-level environmental information gathering and analysis and then, explains the technological and policy framework model adopted in the Wildlife Enforcement Monitoring System (WEMS).

Many of these efforts involve implementing new Information Systems and Technology (IS/IT) and integrating various disparate legacy systems to deliver improved services. While there is a surfeit of literature that have outlined the various organizational and technical challenges posed by Technology Integration Solutions (TIS), few studies have examined the role of stakeholders and surrounding challenges when implementing TIS in LGAs. The TIS adoption process involves several stakeholders, each with specific domain knowledge and expertise that are crucial to the success of TIS projects. In this paper, the authors use the concept of stakeholder theory to analyze the role of stakeholders during the TIS adoption process with regards to their perceptions on the factors influencing TIS adoption in LGAs and their involvement on the adoption lifecycle phases. A qualitative multiple case study approach is adopted to empirically highlight the different categories of stakeholders involved in the TIS adoption process, the dynamic nature and importance of their role, and why their domain knowledge and expertise are vital for TIS projects. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","E-Government; Enterprise Application Integration; Local Government Authorities; Stakeholder theory; Stakeholders; Technology Integration Solutions (TIS)",""

Lacking an explicit and systematic universal service policy, the Chinese government initially designated the major telecommunications carriers to carry out the task, which is commonly referred as ""telephone service in every village project"". So far, the project is going well and all the planned deadlines are met. In addition to connections, government and business entities are developing various information services to bring timely and useful economic, educational and agricultural information to those rural residents.The primary research question of this paper is to look at whether this government-led model is sustainable in the future. The study is conducted in Sichuan, a typical western province where the divide between the urban and rural area is very prominent while, surprisingly, the agricultural informatization service in that region has gained national attention. The study shows that the lack of vision, coherent strategy and a sustainable model are the issues that need to be addressed. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","China; Digital divide; Informatization; Rural development; Telecommunications; Universal service",""

This paper addresses one of the factors that appears to be important in several conceptualizations of how to approach the digital divide; the differential possession of so-called digital skills. The problem of being short of skills becomes urgent when governments suppose that citizens are able to complete about every task on the Internet. Operational definitions for operational, formal, information and strategic skills are used to measure the Internet skills of the Dutch population at large, by giving 109 subjects nine government related assignments to be accomplished on the Internet. Subjects were recruited following a two step approach; randomly select a sample from the book/list of fixed telephony subscribers, followed by drawing a selective quota sample for the strata of gender, age and educational level. The results indicate that on average 80% of the operational skill Internet tasks, 72% of formal Internet skills tasks, 62% of the information Internet skills tasks and 22% of strategic Internet skills tasks assigned have been successfully completed. The Dutch government's expectation that every citizen with an Internet connection is able to complete the assignments following tasks the government thinks every Internet user can perform, clearly is not justified. The article provides two types of policy recommendations to change this state of affairs. Recommendations for improving government websites and for improving the skill levels of Dutch citizens are suggested. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","Citizens; Digital; Policy; Skills",""

The paper utilizes a qualitative research approach that is underpinned by critical realist assumptions. Actor-Network Theory was used as the meta-theory for the analysis. The findings point to a thinly-veiled control agenda by the Central Government bid to extend their control over local authorities through E-Government. The process of building an E-Government infrastructure is unfolding in an environment in which local actors' interests are weakly inscribed, while interests of the global actors are strongly inscribed. The overall implication is a trend in which the Central Government is enhancing bureaucratization through managerialization. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

There are many indicators of information use, but it is challenging for service institutions to gain a current and comprehensive view of the research practices and preferences of their users. Information stakeholders must seek out current data to gauge the potential success of new initiatives and policies in order to meet user needs. To that end, a user study was conducted on the University of Montana campus in spring of 2006. The survey was sent to a random, stratified sample of the campus population. The instrument included questions on frequency of government information use, methods of locating and learning about government documents, awareness of the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP), and service and format preferences. The results show that the majority of researchers are using government information at least quarterly and that they most often use general search engines to find it. Respondents indicate a strong interest in alerting services, tutorials, virtual reference, and topic-oriented assistance.

Free flow of information in government agencies is just as important. For example, in child welfare, entities that fund social services programs have increasingly demanded improved outcomes for clients in return for continued financial support. To this end, most child welfare agencies are paying more attention to the outcomes of children in their care. In North Carolina, many county departments of social services have successfully adopted the self-evaluation model to monitor the effects of their programs on the outcomes of children. Such efforts in self-evaluation require good information flow from state division of social services to county departments of social services.

Keyword matching is a commonly used technique for mapping from a single taxonomy to a single regulation. In this paper, we examine techniques to address two other mapping problems: from a single taxonomy to multiple regulations and from multiple taxonomies to a single regulation. Those techniques - Cosine similarity, Jaccard coefficient, and market basket analysis - provide metrics for measuring the similarity between concepts from different taxonomies.

The E-jiwon task management system of the Office of the President, invented by President Roh himself, served as the archetype for the reform. This study explores and critiques the administration's choice of a ""process and system"" reform over institutional reform, examines the legal framework used to enact the reform and its shortcomings, and analyzes the benefits and deficiencies of the E-jiwon as a tool for democracy in the archives.

Government organizations no longer doubt the need to deliver their services on line. Instead, the question that is more relevant is how well the electronic services offered by a particular organization perform in comparison with those offered by others. Benchmarking is currently a popular means of answering that question. The benchmarking of e-Government services has reached a critical stage where, as we argue, simply measuring the number of electronic services is not enough and a more sophisticated approach is needed.

The State of Florida has over 2 trillion dollars of residential properties exposed to hurricane risk. The State has declared that it shall adopt public policy to encourage the use of sophisticated actuarial methods to assure that consumers are charged lawful insurance rates (Section 627.0628(1)(a)). To that effect, the State's insurance regulatory agency, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR), sponsored the development of a Florida Public Hurricane Loss Model (FPHLM) to assess the risk and project insured residential losses. The FPHLM is an open and public model that has been developed primarily by university experts without influence from either the insurance industry or the state regulators. It is open to public scrutiny and provides an understandable baseline to check the assumptions as well as the outputs of the proprietary models. The FPHLM thus makes the rate evaluation process more objective and less political. It enables the state to justify rejecting or accepting rate increases based on an independent and transparent model, rather than a process that can be influenced politically. As a multi-disciplinary large scale research project with an iterative and incremental development cycle, the FPHLM system development and integration faced numerous challenges varying from technical factors to project management aspects. This paper will discuss the research experiences accumulated during the development of the FPHLM and the impact it has had on the homeowner insurance rate filing process in the State of Florida. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Incorporating specific perspectives of each stakeholder in its own domain for evaluation is vital for supporting diffusion of IT innovations. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a value assessment framework that combines the value understanding from both public and private stakeholders. Applying this framework not only allows the value assessment of business-to-government IT innovations incorporating different needs and requirements of various current stakeholders, but it also provides common and objective evaluation criteria on similar business-to-government IT innovations for potential adopters from both domains.

The latter have not been as universally embraced or adopted as the former. The lack of enthusiasm for moral rights is argued to be because the social utility of this aspect of the copyright regime has gone largely unrecognized. In fact, moral rights ensure that the information needs of the public are being met because they enhance the ability to assess the authority and reliability of information. While historically this has not been as important as enhancing the supply of information, a function performed by the economic rights of copyright, in the context of the new information environment, the role played by moral rights is becoming increasingly important.

This reform in government information policy parallels a global movement of intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations, which have pressed countries to advance the norm of transparency. Competition in the global economy has also provided a strong incentive for governments to show openness, as business leaders and donor nations contend that access-to-information is critical for efficient markets. Given the growing interaction between governments and transnational firms, and the global emphasis on access-to-information, this cross-national study examines the relationship between business executives' perceptions of transparency in government policymaking, and several indicators suggested in the literature as means to advance the flow of information about government. The study found countries that respondents ranked as 'most transparent' had significantly higher levels of access-to-information laws, telecommunication infrastructure, E-Government, free press, and higher income levels, than countries with low transparency levels. Our regression findings indicate that telecommunications infrastructure and free press influenced the perceptions of government transparency in a positive and significant way. The evidence indicates that democracy did not contribute toward the perceptions of transparency. The findings also suggest that nations aiming for openness by adopting access-to-information laws and engaging in E-Government may signal to businesses that their governments are aware of the international norm of transparency-though these conditions are not necessarily sufficient to advance the perceptions of government transparency. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In the e-Government implementation context, many governments have invested huge amounts of money and manpower to make intergovernmental services both available and user-accepted, although some individuals have no intention of using them. The electronic document management system (EDMS) is the most popular intergovernmental service in the e-Government project. Thus, e-Government researchers need to identify the factors that determine user acceptance of EDMS. Using the theory of planned behavior (TPB) as a theoretical framework, this study investigates the effect of a set of antecedent factors on the intention to accept EDMS. Collected from a sample of 186 users of real e-Government's EDMS in Taiwan, the results strongly support the utilization of TPB in predicting users' intention to accept EDMS. In addition, the findings indicate that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, training, compatibility, external influence, interpersonal influence, self-efficacy, and facilitating conditions are significant predictors of users' intention to utilize EDMS.

This study first looks at how the developmental mechanism of Korea during the KII project signifies the weaker status of the civilian government of the 90s. This study then shows how in the KII project, the government served primarily as a moderator mediating conflicts between the private sector and the relevant public agencies. To describe the close state-capital linkages in the KII project, this study focuses on the government's financial investment system for enticing the private sector to install the IT infrastructure, the neatly coordinated policy networks between the public and private entities, and the policy discourses by which the government achieved a national consensus on IT-driven economic development. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A research framework was developed based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. Two hundred questionnaires were randomly distributed to respondents in the Multimedia Super Corridor, Malaysia. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The research discovered that Malaysians do not have high intentions to use MyKad NIC and DL applications. The reasons being lack of understanding of MyKad's benefits (e.g. more secure and reliable NIC and DL, and less invasion of privacy, forgery, and identity theft), lack of facilitating conditions (e.g. non-availability of card readers during checks and non-recognition of MyKad) and anxiety of damaging the card due to excessive use. Consequently, there is a lack of social support (e.g. influence from peer group) and credibility of using the applications. The research had successfully adapted UTAUT model to study the user acceptance of MyKad applications. Recommendations were given to increase the acceptance rate and to resolve the discovered issues. The research can be replicated to investigate the acceptance of smart NIC and DL used in the US, the UK, China, India, and Hong Kong. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The value of the organizational strategic alignment approach for developing specific operational Web 2.0 strategies for government organizations is explored both theoretically and empirically. On the basis of a review of the literature we conclude that there are no a priori reasons why the idea of a fit between IT strategy and business strategic orientation cannot be applied to the development of operational Web 2.0 strategies for government organizations. The empirical exploration based on intervention research at the Dutch Department of Education results in the identification of five configurations: organizational transparency, organizational interactions, policy sector transparency, policy sector interactions and process and policy innovation. These configurations are logically consistent with the strategic orientations of the three directorates of the Department of Education. This overview does not pretend to be exhaustive but validates the idea that an alignment approach leads to differences in operational strategies. The configuration approach provides organizations with useful a starting point for developing their Web 2.0 strategies. © 2009.","Intervention research; Strategic business alignment; Web 2.0 strategy",""

Using actor-network theory, this study relates the socio-political construction of Korea's strategy for convergence reform. Key research questions include: (1) what social and political factors influence strategy formulation and (2) how do different interests stabilize ideologies in which actors formulate their strategies based on their interests. Despite the dynamic interactions, the actor-network around convergence has yet not been effectively stabilized, as the politics of convergence is complex and marked by paradoxical features.

One of the goals of the European Union is to achieve trade facilitation as well as to secure import and export. In order to achieve this goal, the European Government aims to have a common e-customs standardized solution. For this reason, the European Government provided an e-government model. However, while the e-government model regulates the boundaries of the e-government elements and provides high-level functional and technical specifications, the adoption part is in the hands of the individual EU member states. Procurement of information technology and implementation of e-customs solutions are not specified. The main goal of this study is, therefore, to identify facilitators and barriers that can influence the adoption of standardized e-customs solutions. The research is based on Rogers' theory of innovation considering the technological, organizational, and environmental context. Within the framework of a European funded project, we conducted our study collecting data from interviews and workshops involving an inhomogeneous group of participants, i.e. stakeholders coming from academy, industry, and governmental institutions. By demonstrating the existence of four generic facilitators (benefits potential of the public sector; procedural improvements and streamlined business processes; avoidance of misinterpretations of standardized regulations; and standardization of processes, messages and data models) and three barriers (slowdown in regulation execution due to missing procedural templates, increased complexity in the standardization process itself, electronification of operations) related to customs management, the article contributes towards the research in diffusion and adoption of e-government standards and in particular of standardized e-customs solutions as well as political and societal impact of e-customs policies. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The VIP upgraded the objectives of previous telephone and television ""Village Access Projects"" (""VAPs""), an upgrade which is intended to provide ""comprehensive information services"" in rural areas. The execution of the VIP regime has been faced with challenges. The lack of explicitly defined objectives and institutional arrangement has led to regulatory confusion and has compromised the outcome of initiatives taken by central department and regional/local governments which are more often independent in actions.

Blogging, in particular, has been seen to have significant potential to merge the public and the personal in new ways, potentially altering the nature of politics, particularly in nations where political processes are formalistic and highly regulated. As an example, politicians who blog have developed a new approach to communicating with their constituencies, in that the private thoughts of the political actor are expressed in a relatively unmediated environment. This study, which examines trends in blog linkages among Assembly members in Korea, provides a longitudinal analysis of blog linkages in order to assess the long term implications of new media technologies in Korean society and politics. The data were gathered from the blogs of Korea's National Assembly members for 2005 and 2006. An analysis of these links indicates that, indeed, there is an increased use of blogs among National Assembly members. However, it seems that over time, the network becomes sparser, less integrated, and more decentralized. This study also suggests that offline imperatives for political organization figure prominently in the motives of establishing online linkages to other political blogs. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Typically, they have no central authority, are governed by networks and contain both emerging and purposefully designed parts. Their use varies over time, and a large number of individuals use them for different purposes. The basic digital government infrastructure has evolved over time and the development towards the next generation of digital government infrastructure (NGI) is under development. In this introduction, we discuss aspects of infrastructure development and this special issue contains papers contributing to the development of the NGI in various fields including customs, crisis management, legislation and regulation, providing a number of possible functions and services that may become part of the NGI. We argue that policy-makers should view the NGI from a complex-adaptive systems (CAS) view and that the next generation of infrastructures will provide not only technological services, including connectivity and security, but also shared information and knowledge in various fields, thus making it easier to participate, translate legislation and manage collaboration between public and private parties and in this way advancing digital government. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

So much so that it has been said that the digital divide makes the segment of society on the ""right side"" of the divide (the digitally endowed group) better off and that on the ""wrong side"" (the digitally challenged group) worse off. This is not always true, however, in a social choice situation where members of a society collectively choose one alternative from a set of alternatives. To identify conditions when this does not hold, a model of the digital divide is setup in which the digitally endowed group receives better information than the digitally challenged group. Preferences of all individuals over outcomes are distributed over a scale. This distribution is correlated with the digital divide: the outcome preferred by the digitally endowed group differs from that preferred by the other group. The alternative chosen by majority becomes the choice of the overall society. The ensuing analysis shows that individuals located centrally on the preference scale are sensitive to information about the state. The choice of centrally located digitally challenged individuals, made on a lack of information, makes the digitally challenged group worse off as has been predicted before. In some cases, the digitally endowed group is worse off as well. In the case of highly polar alternatives, social welfare decreases due to the welfare loss of the digitally endowed group. Results suggest that policymakers must manage the digital divide in a customized manner depending on the preferences context. They should not only focus on improving the welfare of the digitally challenged, but also focus on the welfare of the digitally endowed group so that this welfare does not decrease. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

From information involving the highest level of government administration and national security, to information existing at the level of the private company in the form of trade secrets or personal data, all are under the constant threat of being compromised. In this study, the researchers attempt to evaluate the information security maturity level and provide clear thoughtful analysis of the information security landscapes of the Malaysian Public Service (MPS) organizations. This study uses convenience sampling and the required data collected from 970 targeted individuals through a self-administrated survey. In addition, a survey questionnaire is utilized to gauge the security landscape and to further understand the occurrence of incidents, the sources of attack, and the types of technical safeguard. Findings revealed that the highest security incidents experienced by the MPS were spamming (42%), followed by attacks of malicious codes (41%). Twenty-five percent of incidents originated from within the organizations, 15% originated from outside, and 11% were from a mixture of internal and external sources. Also, it shows that 49% of incidents were from sources unknown to the respondents. The top most deployed safeguards by the MPS were found to be firewalls (95%), followed by anti-virus software (92%), and access control to information system (89%). Findings on the maturity level show that 61% of respondents are at Level 3, followed by 21% at Level 2 where the information security processes are still considered an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) domain.

Prior research has focused on institutionalization but offered few clues on these institutionalizing practices of E-Gov within organizations. Our theoretical framework posits that institutionalizing of E-Gov can be analyzed as situated practices. We apply this conceptual approach to analyze the case of an 11-year implementation of a strategic E-Gov project that automated the land mapping registration services and their delivery to the public. We examine institutionalization outcomes as construction of actor-networks and institutionalizing practices as enactment of actor-network reconfiguration. Our findings provide evidence of black-box status for some E-Gov functions and situated institutionalization for others. We thereby extend the research on E-Gov post-adoption and post-implementation behaviors by providing early evidence of generic institutionalization measures and institutionalizing practices. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Since the year 2000, a number of e-Government stage models have been suggested by international organizations, consulting firms, and individual researchers. However, these models seem to be incongruent with each other as these are based on different perspectives and use somewhat different metaphors. This presents a difficulty not only in understanding different research results, but also in planning future actions for e-Government. Without a common frame of reference for understanding the developmental stages and perspectives reflected in different models and stages, e-Government research may become fragmented and disconnected from each other. In this research, we have conducted a qualitative meta-synthesis of twelve e-Government stage models. Concepts, metaphors, and themes contained in these developmental models are extracted through a series of in-depth semantic analyses of descriptions and explanations. The first order concepts and themes are subjected to an interpretive synthesis identifying reciprocal relationships which in turn leads to the identification of implied metaphors and themes. Five metaphors are identified: presenting, assimilating, reforming, morphing and e-governance, while two underlying themes surface: citizen/service and operation/technology. These concepts, metaphors, and themes are synthesized into a common frame of reference using a reciprocal translation technique. A supportive line of argument is developed for this frame of reference so that different e-Government stage models can be translated into each other. This study contributes to current research through offering theoretical advances related to the stages of e-Government. Furthermore, the metaphors and themes identified in this study would be useful as a conceptual frame for researchers to evaluate and understand the development of e-Government, and as a base road map for practitioners in planning future e-Government projects. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Developmental model; Digital government; E-Government; Evolutionary model; Innovative government; Meta-synthesis; Qualitative meta-synthesis; Stage model; Stages of development",""

However, when respondents replied that 'Compensation' was 'No,' a statistically significant, negative relationship between 'Level of Education' and 'PCT Use' exists.

The author served as special adviser to the House of Commons Select Committee on Public Administration which oversaw the Government proposals for legislation and the progress of the Bill into the House of Commons. The FOIA introduced pro-active publication of information via Publication Schemes, which were introduced on a staggered basis across the public sector and on January 1, 2005, rights of individual access were granted to individuals. The Act covers well over 100,000 public authorities in the UK and includes both Houses of Parliament. There is a power to add private bodies to the Act's coverage. The Act covers UK, English, Welsh, and Northern Irish public authorities. Scotland has its own FOIA which was enacted by the Scottish Parliament in 2002. The paper will examine the operation of the UK legislation and the role of the Information Commissioner and the Information Tribunal which deal with complaints of refusal and appeals respectively. The jurisprudence has been voluminous and now the English courts are beginning to hear appeals from the tribunal. The article will examine the major trends of the legislation and the problems presented by the legislation. The Government has already issued vetoes under the Act overriding the Commissioner's decision to grant access to the Cabinet papers relating to the Cabinet discussion on entering into war with Iraq and then on devolution of power to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. The decisions to open up the files on MPs expenses have caused one of the major constitutional crises in the UK in the last 75. years. As well as examining the way the Act has been interpreted, the author will essay some preliminary analyses of the impact of the Act on the realization of government objectives in passing the Act. The FOIA does sit alongside other legislation allowing access to personal files and access to environmental information and the whole information debate is set in the context of heightened sensitivity and secrecy in time of the war on terror and the state's increasing capacity to demand, store, and share information. The UK experience of the information debate will be examined. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","",""

Criticism about the provision of E-Government services, however, has proposed a more user-oriented approach. The user needs to be placed at the center of the development and the provision of electronic public services. Simultaneously, it is important to investigate the impact of the new services on customers. User satisfaction may indeed have a decisive influence on large-scale adoption and use of E-Government services. This article describes the development of a comprehensive model for measuring user satisfaction in the context of E-Government. It rethinks the e-strategies of government and subsequently presents a conceptual model derived from ICT acceptance theory. Both quantitative as well as qualitative research have been carried out in order to elaborate the model and to formulate adequate indicators for measuring user satisfaction. The measurement model has been tested using data from five Flemish E-Government websites. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied in order to investigate the goodness of fit of the model and the underlying indicators. Based on the results, it becomes possible to reduce the list of indicators to nine items, still covering the full conceptual model. With this shortlist of satisfaction determinants, E-Government suppliers would be able to get a clear view on acceptance of their internet services by the users. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

No department or agency supported the legislation, and the President signed it into law with no small amount of reluctance. This climate of opinion resulted in a hostile environment for the initial administration of the statute. To maintain faithful administration of the FOIA and to preserve its purpose, congressional committees found it necessary to conduct vigorous oversight of its implementation and, on occasion, to take remedial action by amending its provisions.

High users of information and communications technologies (ICT) were more likely to use e-government measures, and are more positive towards e-government in general across several measures. Similar to a number of U.S. studies, we find a 'digital divide,' where older age, and less education were associated with lower ICT and e-government use and support.

We analyze a case study involving municipalities that wanted to share services and found that simulation models facilitate discussions about alternative arrangements prior to implementation. The simulation models show that shared services can result in improved efficiency and service levels. However, the type of arrangement determines the level of efficiency, as high service levels can only be realized at the expense of efficiency, which means that the decision about the type of arrangement is not obvious. Decision-makers should understand the implications of shared service arrangement prior to implementation and make decisions with regard to key design variables. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Through the method of content analysis, this study reviews the process of decision making, implementation, and other issues emerging as a result of the adoption of new technologies in public authorities, such as the cognition of the employee toward the benefits and effectiveness of IS in public authorities. Learning from this case, this article identifies key lessons and provides suggestions regarding the managerial issues related to the discontinuity of technologies in the workplace. These goals are achieved through reflexive exploration of the sense-making process among civil servants.

We argue that marketization's target may well be bureaucracy, but the organizational form is a repository for democratic, civic, and public service values that can be eroded through how outsourcing has been conducted. The call for a reevaluation and the case for a distinctive public services management ethos are made if such values as equality, impartiality, communal good and public service are to be pursued and delivered. Selective outsourcing is revealed as effective - together with much needed rebuilding of internal capabilities - in keeping control of IT destiny, delivering on public service requirements, and managing external supply.

Although E-Government is a global phenomenon, simply transferring ICT solutions and related organizational concepts from developed to developing countries seems inappropriate. E-Government undoubtedly has the potential to reduce administrative and development problems. However, it is obvious that compared to developed countries, additional effort is necessary when implementing E-Government in developing countries. More than in developed countries, the different initial institutional, cultural, and wider administrative contexts must be considered to avoid unintended effects. It is oversimplifying the issue to merely state that E-Government projects fail in Africa and other developing regions. Although E-Government in African countries lags far behind developed countries, this should be considered more as a state failure or lack of capacity in general. In particular, the different administrative contexts and rationalities must be taken into an account when implementing E-Government projects and strategies. Therefore, especially for African countries, a context-oriented approach seems to be a more promising route to the successful implementation of E-Government. The results of this approach may not seem ambitious from a western perspective, but could contribute to the solution of real-life and development problems in African societies. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Stage models are predictable patterns which exist in the growth of organizations and unfold as discrete time periods that result in discontinuity and can help e-government development towards joined-up government. Although stage models may be conceptually appealing, these models are often not empirically validated, do not transcend the level of individual organizations, and provide little practical support to policymakers. Furthermore, they do not include the dynamic capabilities needed by organizations to transform from one stage to the next stage. In this paper, a five-stage model is presented that describes the progression from stove-piped situations towards a nationwide, customer-oriented, and joined-up government. The dynamic capabilities needed for realizing each stage are identified. This model is empirically validated and helps government agencies benchmark their position, realize their role in the formation of a joined-up government, develop the necessary capabilities, and adopt centrally developed infrastructural facilities aimed at moving to the next stage. We found that growth stages are useful for providing guidance and can be used by policymakers to stimulate the developments of capabilities needed by organizations to migrate from one stage to another. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

However, despite high levels of investment, a broad range of applications, and various methods of access relatively low levels of various methods of access, relatively low levels of usage (and even familiarity with e-gov) are still common. For example, in Canada, long recognized as a leader in implementing e-gov, less than 27% of Canadians used E-Gov during the past 12 months and 81% of c non-users report a low level of familiarity with either federal or provincial governmental services available through e-gov (Canada, 2004). Or, consider the showcase e-gov Gyandoot project in the Dhar district in central India, whose population is estimated at 1.7 million. Even after implementing e-gov in a showcase project for the rural poor, a study by the Center for Electronic Governance, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad concluded that this model of ""government to citizen"" service delivery has serious sustenance problems (World Bank, 2004).

The USA Patriot Act and other legislative and administrative responses are discussed in relation to previous actions in times of crisis. Cases involving free speech and academic freedom are examined. It is concluded that requirements and procedures for tracking overseas students, along with long delays in processing visas, have had the most direct impact on the academy in terms of on-going administrative requirements and reduced applications and enrollments by international students. Self-censorship appears to have chilled free speech from within the academy. Outside, critics increasingly question the concepts of academic freedom, tenure, and the underlying values and autonomy of the academy. The passing of time without additional terrorist attacks in the United States may result in reduced levels of fear and some relaxation of restrictions; however, this could be offset by continued high level security alerts. The acceptance of increased surveillance in all aspects of society and terrorist attacks throughout the world make it too early to predict the long-term outcome of 9/11 on the academy in terms of enrollment, speech, and academic freedom. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In these two cases, although the government had tried to induce information technology innovation by using de jure standardization, different results occurred. In the CDMA case, the government led the overall innovation process by getting compliance from private companies, whereas in the IMT-2000 case, the government faced resistance from private companies and, thus, did not achieve the intended results for information technology innovation. Why did similar standardization policies applied to similar cases bring about different results? From empirical evidence, we conclude that the success of government intervention in de jure standard-setting in information technologies is contingent on the following conditions: (1) technological conditions, related to technology knowledge and technology cycle; (2) market conditions, concerned with market governance structure and market prospects for technology; and (3) conditions for government capability, which provide technology knowledge and guarantee the technology market. All those conditions are the variables in determining a government-friendly environment and securing more compliance from private enterprises in information technology innovation through de jure standard-setting. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

More specifically, the study explores the benefits that users receive from 2-1-1 referral services that are distinct from the actual social assistance provided by various service agencies; what policymakers should consider when funding and implementing 2-1-1 services; and the operational structure and interagency relationships that can maximize the benefit of the referral service to both individuals and existing social service agencies. Researchers conducted an extensive literature review and case study to examine dimensions of service performance, benefit-cost, and user outcomes of 2-1-1 services. This study further identifies potential measures and protocols for developing a holistic assessment program that goes beyond the reporting of quantitative inputs and outputs associated with a 2-1-1 agency. The centerpiece of this study is the creation of a logic model that identifies benefits and costs at three different levels: the individual, organizational, and societal. In addition, the model incorporates the dimension of time in order to distinguish between short-, medium-, and long-term benefits. Thus, the model provides a basis for incremental and flexible assessment of service performance that can lead to the creation of a culture of continuous improvement and ongoing evaluation for 2-1-1 services. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

This situation has led to a national ""broadband divide."" That is, the deployment of wireline broadband is very limited in Canada's northern, isolated, rural, and remote areas because of the significant expense of installation and maintenance of the wired infrastructure needed to reach dwellings in these locations. Terrestrial broadband wireless technology, on the other hand, does not entail the same kind of physical infrastructure. As a result, there are dramatic changes in how spatial considerations affect the provision of broadband Internet services (BIS) to areas beyond the urban zone. In particular, the spatial question is now focused on assessing the capacity for different technological solutions to reach profitable population bases, and brings to the forefront organizations that are developing non-line-of-sight (NLOS) technologies that would permit wireless Internet access over much greater distances than current solutions. We begin this paper by establishing the importance of broadband connectivity to Canada's northern, isolated, rural, and remote communities. This discussion comments on the role of the Government of Canada in the provision of broadband connectivity to residents of these communities, and outlines the current regulatory issues that govern wireless services and policy formulation. The second part of the paper illustrates the use of geographic information system (GIS) approaches in the study of wireless broadband planning and deployment. Case study findings suggest that GIS applications can make a significant contribution to the analysis of wireless deployment planning, to the understanding of the relationships between wireless signal sources and consumers, and to the spatial configuration of terrestrial wireless broadband networks. We conclude the paper by discussing how the GIS approach employed could be used to inform the public policy process with regard to increasing access to broadband Internet services in all regions of the country, and thereby providing the opportunity for all Canadians, regardless of location, to fully participate in the Information Society. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Information asymmetry often stems from inadequate information sharing and can result in negative consequences for both the information poor and the information rich. Information asymmetry has been insufficiently studied as a possible cause of underdevelopment and inequality. In response, we develop a typology to classify information asymmetry into two categories, horizontal and vertical, and then identify those information sharing practices that cause the imbalance. To illustrate the negative consequences of information asymmetry and the potential benefits of information sharing, we discuss two examples from the experiences of modern American Indian tribes. First, Indian tribes face horizontal information asymmetry when they attempt to access the capital markets, and second, they face vertical information asymmetry in terms of law enforcement data sharing. This article also describes our ongoing examination of horizontal information sharing among tribes and vertical information sharing between tribes and others sovereigns in the American polity as possible solutions to the problems created by information asymmetry. These strategic responses are embodied in two information systems, the Tribal Financial Information Clearinghouse and an Intergovernmental Tracking System for sharing law enforcement data.

Ultimately, the model is tested with structural equation modeling techniques. It appears to fit to the data after some modifications and exclusion of variables. The ultimate model could be used to explain the acceptance and use of government Internet services. The larger correlation model could serve as a framework for research of Internet services in general. The social-demographic and psychological factors usually investigated in new technology acceptance and usage research do not prove to be strong here. Instead, it is demonstrated that the availability of Internet services, the knowledge of this availability, the preference to use digital channels, and the ability and experience to do this are the primary conditions. The most general conclusion drawn is that the acceptance and use of government Internet services is a matter of learning, and that acceptance and use should be analyzed as a dynamic process. People will stick to their habits of using traditional channels unless they happen to learn a better alternative.

The extent to which traditional IS success models can be extended to investigating eGovernment systems success remains unclear. This study provides the first empirical test of an adaptation of DeLone and McLean's IS success model in the context of G2C eGovernment. The model consists of six dimensions: information quality, system quality, service quality, use, user satisfaction, and perceived net benefit. Structural equation modeling techniques are applied to data collected by questionnaire from 119 users of G2C eGovernment systems in Taiwan. Except for the link from system quality to use, the hypothesized relationships between the six success variables are significantly or marginally supported by the data. The findings provide several important implications for eGovernment research and practice. This paper concludes by discussing limitations of the study which should be addressed in future research. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Publications of performance results stimulate schools and hospitals to score better on performance indicators because they feel the 'public eyes' on them. However, the risk of a 'performance paradox' and adverse effects is great since strategic behavior may lead to higher scores but not improve the effectiveness of these organizations.

From recent experiences around the world, it seems clear that in order to enjoy some of the greatest benefits of digital government, the integration of information across organizational boundaries is necessary. However, these digital government initiatives face additional challenges, since the required level of interorganizational collaboration and trust is often not supported by existing institutional arrangements, organizational structures, and managerial processes. In fact, many institutions and administrative structures found in government contexts offer incentives for single-agency work only, which produces stove-pipe systems.

How does increased state regulation of municipal broadband networks affect this trend and how can cities respond? As cities use wireless broadband technology to enhance services to citizens, the growth of municipal wireless deployments has transitioned from linear to exponential. In response, many states have passed laws to regulate and restrict cities' ability to own, operate, deploy, or profit from either telecommunications or information services. Current and pending laws will be examined to understand how cities can deploy a wireless broadband network under these regulations. An analysis of municipal facilities and technology expertise illustrates the opportunity for public-private cooperation in wireless deployments.

It was elaborated in order to measure the variation of the intellectual capital in public organizations involved in government-to-government (G2G) endeavors. In order to achieve this, a heuristic frame was developed to evaluate the impact of G2G endeavors on the components of the intellectual capital of a public agency, namely its human capital, organizational capital, external capital, and innovation capital. Applying this heuristic frame to a G2G endeavor in Brazil linking the Brazilian Central Bank and the Justice Department, a positive impact on the intellectual capital of the Courts of Justice associated with it was detected. Moreover, it was concluded that this G2G undertaking influenced all the components of the intellectual capital of the Courts of Justice alike. Thereafter, the model was validated through a positive and strong statistical correlation between the intellectual capital variation in the Courts of Justice and the value perception of the employees both accrued from the G2G undertaking.

First, the use of e-mail leads to informal formalization: the style of communication is more informal but the content focuses less on personal issues and emphasizes efficient recordings of agreements. Second, the use of e-mail leads to hierarchical horizontalization: horizontal contacts take a more central position in bureaucratic organizations but these horizontal contacts are tightly linked to vertical structures.

However, it is neither a homogeneous nor a static phenomenon. Recent empirical studies have identified two important dynamics in e-government evolution. First, e-government in general has evolved from its initial presence on the Internet to more transactional and integrated applications. Second, at the aggregate level and as a general trend, national governments have started adding technological and organizational sophistication and state and local governments have followed. Based on the study of systems of rules, this paper argues that these two dynamics in the evolution of e-government are, at least in part, the result of pressures from public managers attempting to solve problems and from citizens, businesses, and other stakeholders, attempting to control the actions of public managers. Both forces, related to performance and accountability, respectively, have promoted change in the systems of rules governing the design, implementation, and use of e-government initiatives. Specifically, they have generated a cycle that continually increases technological and organizational sophistication in e-government initiatives and have also promoted the episodic and evolving adoption of similar features across levels of government. These two related evolutionary dynamics and the characterization of e-government as systems of rules and standards have some important policy implications, which are briefly discussed at the end of the paper. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.","Accountability; Digital government; Electronic government; Evolution of e-government; Government; Performance; Systems of rules",""

Congressional subpoenas for general information, documents, and testimony from high-ranking executive officials has not only generated significant inter-branch conflict but has also developed into a controversy that could result in a legal standoff between Congress and the President. Congress's ability to obtain access to information, whether in the form of documents or testimony, from the Executive is primarily enforced through political negotiation and accommodation that generally take place outside of public view. Contempt may be used by Congress to coerce compliance, punish the contemnor, and/or remove the obstruction. This paper focuses on Congress's contempt power and congressional authority to enforce its requests for information, documents, and testimony from both private individuals and the Executive Branch. First, it examines the source of Congress's contempt power. Next, it discusses and analyzes the procedures associated with each of the three different types of contempt proceedings-inherent contempt, statutory criminal contempt, and statutory civil contempt. Finally, this paper concludes by addressing several of the unique constitutional, legal, and political problems that are associated with congressional contempt proceedings against Executive Branch officials.","",""

Improvement is necessary because, based on empirical data from various sources, the conclusion can be drawn that there is a gap between the communication channels governments prefer and those that citizens prefer. Governments may be too much guided by rational arguments like the cost efficiency of channels while citizens may choose channels depending on, e.g., task characteristics, personal characteristics or situational factors. In order to close the existing gap and to increase understanding about how different channel types may be positioned in multichannel management, this article proposes an alternative multichannel management strategy that takes both the citizen's and the government's perspective into account. This strategy is based on differences in channel types and channel modes via which governments and citizens interact. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The process of adoption and configuration of public Wi-Fi networks in Austin, Texas, is the focus of our case study. Austin is one of the most ""unwired"" cities in the United States and increasingly known as a world-class industrial center in wireless. The development of strategic visions about public Wi-Fi services among user groups and local startups provided a fertile ground for diverse partnerships among nonprofit groups, broadband providers, wireless ISPs, and the city government. We also found that the popularity of the venue-sponsored or free-to-end-user model of access is supported by different providers that see their interests represented in the growth of public wireless broadband. However, the prevailing model of public Wi-Fi has a strong commercial bias. This, combined with the historical socioeconomic divides in the city, has resulted in an uneven geography of public Wi-Fi networks. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","",""

Both have theoretical and practical underpinnings driving each discipline; are interdisciplinary in focus; and both professions gather and disseminate information to stakeholders. Essential to the success of each discipline is an engaged user population. The authors use a case study from the Village of Oak Park to examine and reflect upon the effect of the Internet and other technologies in the public's ability to participate in an open planning process. The Village of Oak Park is known for its architectural heritage and outspoken community. Within its 4.5 square miles live a diverse population of approximately 52,000 people from different cultures, races, ethnicities, professions, lifestyles, religions, ages, and incomes where a majority of the population have some advanced education and over 80% of the households report home Internet use. How does a community like the Village of Oak Park engage in the planning process? What role does information play in this process? Can modern Information Technologies facilitate civic engagement? These questions are examined during a year-long case study conducted by the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) in cooperation with the Village of Oak Park (VOP). Specifically, the investigators examined how information is gathered and used in the planning process and how the introduction of Information Technology (IT) tools influenced public participation and introduced many citizens to e-government through the planning process. The use of these tools is compared to the traditional planning process. Data from the project is presented to demonstrate a different kind of role librarians play in the research process. Last, the authors discuss the role of privacy in the gathering and sharing of information with the reliability of that information and the impact of privacy on the public planning process. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Findings demonstrate that certian types of interest groups are influential in expanding or retarding the growth of e-disclosure policies when controlling for other factors. Findings also demonstrate that greater levels of legislative professionalism, education, and state resources support greater levels of implementation of e-disclosure policies. Greater levels of state infrastructure capacity for e-government are also significant predictor of more extensive e-disclosure implementation.

Although not a violation of law, the Census Bureau realized that this perceived breach of confidentiality would have a negative impact on public trust, and within a few months following the news of the Arab American tabulations it announced that it would no longer assist law enforcement and intelligence agencies with tabulations on ethnic groups and other sensitive populations. In spite of this damage control, we believe that the Bureau's tabulation of Arab Americans provides momentum to a process that adversely affects data quality by increasing both non-response and the cost of obtaining survey and census data. We argue that there are no ""methodological fixes"" that can repair the damage, and further that public relations campaigns and internal administrative changes are not optimal solutions because of the governing structure within which the Bureau currently operates. Ultimately, the best way to limit the damage already done is to effect a political solution. Toward this end we describe short- and long-term actions. In the long run, we recommend removing the Census Bureau from the Executive branch of government and re-structuring it under a permanent and non-political oversight panel similar to either the Federal Reserve Board or the Congressional Budget Office.

Education maintains a strong, significant impact on Internet use such that the odds of using the Internet are about three times greater for someone who has some post-secondary education than someone who has, at most, a high school education. An urban-rural digital divide persists in Canada with the odds of using the Internet being almost one-and-a-half times greater for someone who lives in an urban area.

The need for assistance in performing urban planning tasks has led to the rapid development of urban information systems, especially ""e-Planning"" systems, with the support of government policy and emerging information and communication technologies (ICT). In order to enhance the capability of e-Planning and to facilitate 3D visualization and rich analysis of complex city problems, it is very important to allow information from the various sources to be shared and integrated. This paper focuses on technical approaches for multidimensional information integration, especially spatial information integration. In particular it describes the Building Data Integration System (BDIS), developed as part of the IntelCities project, which demonstrates the type of multidimensional systems that are likely to be used in future urban information systems. Functionally, the BDIS demonstrates the feasibility of systems to support the multinational collaboration of construction professionals in the procurement and renovation of buildings. For such systems to be accepted in the United Kingdom (UK) and Europe, they need to be developed with regard to current planning information structures and standards in the UK and Europe which are reviewed in this paper. The achievements and further development of multidimensional information integration through the use of innovative urban data modelling techniques are discussed. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

It draws heavily on an oral history archive compiled by the Department after the event but withheld until 2005 and released then only under court order. Analysis of the interviews shows that coordination and communication were serious problems; securing information early in the emergency was difficult; commanders lacked solid information to direct efforts; information was contradictory and difficult to interpret; the collapse of the WTC towers was difficult to conceptualize; improvisation was common; and false information compounded confusion. The oral history archive also offers insight into the information-processing and decision-making processes of commanders and front-line responders. The oral histories were useful in FDNY analysis of performance on that critical day but they do not provide definitive answers to critical questions such as the timeliness of the order to evacuate the towers.

Geospatial information has been increasing steadily in popularity and use since the advent of geographic information systems in the 1960s. From the early 1990s until the present, research libraries have seen an increase in the availability of geospatial information, and they have also seen a substantial change in the services provided to support the needs of clients seeking that information. However, recent events have altered the ""access landscape."" September 11, 2001, and subsequent events, caused many policy shifts to take place as to how, or whether, access to governmental geospatial information should be granted. This paper explores those policy developments with the goal of prognosticating on the future of access to governmental geospatial information. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","",""

Taking Kenya as an example and using the US judicial process as a foil, this paper examines the proposition that the availability of judicial decisions in case reporters enhances democracy by increasing judicial transparency and contributing to some predictability in the law, thus enhancing the rule of law.

However, the contemporary daily practice of public information provision tends to be seen as incidental to the policymaking process. The introduction of the reflecting license plate in Belgium is a prime example of a case in which little attention has been paid to the quality of public information during the ongoing policy process. First, we define the notion, quality of public information, as a necessary condition for the successful implementation of policy objectives. We then chronologically outline the main policy intentions and decisions, and we describe the factors hindering the smooth introduction of the license plate, focusing on those related to information provision. Finally, we examine whether the current public management reform in the Belgian Federal administration can improve the quality of information supplied during the ongoing policy process. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

E-government clearly has the potential to become an institution that helps to ensure reasoned reflection about political issues and active participation in deliberative democracy by citizens and by members of the government. Though the Internet presents innovative new methods for conveying government information to citizens, it also presents new and serious potential impediments to deliberative democracy, such as group polarization about political issues by online social groups. The ability of e-government sites either to foster democratic dialogue by presenting multiple viewpoints or to enable polarization on political issues by promoting specific views demonstrates a key question about the conceptual foundations of e-government.

Much of the ruckus started with the failure of the agencies to thwart the attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. While the events of 9/11 were magnificent and brought to light shortcomings of the various U.S. intelligence agencies, it is not the first time that the intelligence community failed in its mission. In the recent past, the U.S. intelligence community failed to see signs of the impending collapse of the USSR, or the nuclear tests conducted by India, or the attacks on the USS Cole, or the 1993 attacks on the World Trade Centers. The credibility of a nation depends heavily on the information it presents to the world; much of this information, especially that of high value, arises out of the intelligence community.

Our research suggests that markedly different expectations and uses exist between categories of Federal decision makers. Members of the House and their support staff are fundamentally unconcerned about the technologies and their implications. Senators, their office staff, and staff of Senate committees have a better appreciation for information technologies, and express the need for technologies that would depend on significant system integration activity. Finally, Executive Branch administrators are already incorporating analogous technologies in the operation of their agencies and in their plans for future development. The incongruities in expectations and patterns of use of information technologies should be of interest to researchers and practitioners involved in technology transfer and diffusion within the Federal government. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

As we enter the era of homeland security, one can see a new premium being placed on the role of information to fight terrorism while the policies related to government information practices are in a state of flux. Exactly how these policies are evolving is not always clear. Yet, the decisions being made now will likely have a lasting impact for years to come. In an attempt to better understand dynamics underlying these changes, a number of questions regarding the use, control, and protection of personal and public information are posed in this introduction to the symposium issue. We also review some of the major themes examined in greater detail by the contributors to the symposium. These issues include the role of e-government in homeland security, the emphasis on information sharing, the emergence of new information classification categories, the growth of data mining, and the eroding sense of privacy. While a number of reasons can be offered to justify one policy alternative over another, we conclude that the importance of these issues suggests that they are best debated and implemented during a time not under duress when decisions made in the heat of the moment can lead to unintended consequences.","",""

A two-stage model of e-government growth is applied to municipalities. Stage I is the cataloging of information online and Stage II is transactions being completed online. This article examines the development of these stages along with the e-government relationships being government to citizen (G2C), government to business (G2B), or government to government (G2G). The two-stage model is applied to data from the 2002 International City/County Management Association (ICMA) Electronic Government survey. The findings indicate that G2C Web sites are primarily in Stage I. There does not appear to be much movement outside of the information dissemination stage of e-government. In regards to the G2G relationships, cities are becoming more advanced with many transactions completed over the city's Intranet. However, the greatest advancement has taken place in the G2B relationship, in which procurement of equipment and office supplies was done by around half of the surveyed cities. These findings imply that e-government growth is more pronounced in some areas than others. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","",""

Often used as a means for detecting fraud, assessing risk, and product retailing, data mining involves the use of data analysis tools to discover previously unknown, valid patterns and relationships in large data sets. In the context of homeland security, data mining is often viewed as a potential means to identify terrorist activities, such as money transfers and communications, and to identify and track individual terrorists themselves, such as through travel and immigration records. However, compared to earlier uses of data mining by government, some of the homeland security data mining applications represent a significant expansion in the quantity and scope of data to be analyzed. Three of the higher profile initiatives include the now defunct Terrorism Information Awareness (TIA) project, the recently canceled Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System II (CAPPS II), and the Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange (MATRIX) pilot project.

It concludes with the observation that, in a democracy, representatives of the citizenry, whether elected or appointed, may momentarily cloak their decisionmaking and their policies in secrecy for the good of the nation - to protect it from enemies and to assure its survival. Those representatives must remember that the secrecy they impose is only momentary and that the shrouded decisions and policies they make, once made known to the citizenry, must be acceptable to them. The citizenry, in turn, accept such secrecy only in limited instances and on a momentary basis in order to have the confidence that their representatives are making decisions and policies acceptable to them.

Traditionally, governments have insisted on applying the rule of originator control (ORCON) before they share information with other governments. The ORCON rule allows originating governments to retain control over the declassification of information (if it is classified) or its release to nongovernmental parties. The ORCON rule is being widely applied as the U.S. government responds to the terror attacks of September 11. However, the ORCON rule clashes with the principles underlying most right-to-information (RTI) laws and its extension could undermine governmental accountability.

The Israeli Supreme Court, despite heavy opposition by the public, was nevertheless able in most instances to uphold and protect this liberty. Despite public outcry, the Court performed a delicate balancing act, balancing Israel's need to protect itself from its enemies against the basic freedom of expression to which all of its citizens are entitled.

Now terrorism is not the only issue in the new security agenda, and we appear to have stopped rushing our legislative processes. Yet, policies are still emerging with a lack of public discourse and legislative deliberation. This article reviews two such policies: access to personal information held by airlines and new border practices that include the collection and processing of biometrics. By looking at the negotiations between the U.S. and the European Commission on passenger name records (PNR), the debates in Canada regarding the collection of passenger information, and the deployment of the US-VISIT system, we identify a number of policy dynamics. We can see within these dynamics of policy formation some essential ingredients for discourse and deliberation, which may inform future debates. In particular, this article argues that we may inform policy by looking at the international, regulatory, legal, and technological dynamics of policy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","",""

E-government allows federal agencies to supplement and even supplant private sector roles intermediating between government agencies and users, creating unintended consequences in terms of policy, theory, and practice. The problem is called ""channel conflict"" in the marketing literature, and the typical response is called distribution channel management (DCM). After reviewing the literatures of e-government, information policy, and DCM, the paper explores differing DCM philosophies of two federal agencies: The Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Census Bureau.

The demand side explanation, which is relatively unexplored, examines citizen interaction with e-government and is the focus of this article. E-government presently has evolved into two identifiable stages. The first stage is the information dissemination phase in which governments catalogue information for public use. The second phase is transaction-based e-government in which there is e-service delivery such as paying taxes online. This article argues that the information and transaction phases are closely intertwined with the street-level bureaucracy literature. Various attributes of citizen interaction with electronic government will be tested in this article. One notable finding was that the Internet improved the ability for e-citizens to interact with government, acknowledging some initial movement from street-level to system-level bureaucracies. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

One response by several North American governments has been to introduce e-government or Web-mediated citizen-to-government interaction. This paper tests the extent to which online initiatives have succeeded in increasing trust and external political efficacy in voters. An Internet-based survey of 182 Canadian voters shows that using the Internet to transact with the government had a significantly positive impact on trust and external political efficacy. Interestingly, though the quality of the interaction was important, it was secondary to internal political efficacy in determining trust levels, and not significant in determining levels of external political efficacy (or perceived government responsiveness). For policymakers, this suggests e-government efforts might be better aimed at citizens with high pre-extant levels of trust rather than in developing better Web sites.

The author argues that the founding fathers intentionally did not include language mandating the printing of government information, aside from the Journal as described in the Constitution, for the simple reason that they viewed it as an inherent obligation on the part of all elected officials. As such, restrictive information policies, such as the U.S.A. Patriot Act, impinge upon the original intent of the founding fathers and indeed, threaten the ideal of a democratic society. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","",""

This article provides examples of how federal agency officials have responded to the possibility that their Web sites provide such potentially compromising information. The federal government has not yet issued a government wide policy that addresses this specific contingency. However, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has issued an Internet content advisory and the Attorney General has released a relevant policy statement on the Freedom of Information Act. Both documents are reviewed here. The removal and alteration of information has implications for citizens, as does the Bush Administration's mixed messages on the objectives and procedures of electronic government post-September 11.

This disparity is not for lack of resources; rather it is grounded in self-serving, synthetic priorities that exist among law enforcement agencies or between those agencies and the justice department.

The ""remote line"" issue is especially important because these lines were classified on the other side of the digital divide as the ""have nots"" of the high-speed Internet age.

However, low population density makes it difficult for rural areas to support expensive technology investments such as are required for broadband. In addition, history shows rural adoption timelines significantly lag those in urban areas, which slows development of the demand economically necessary to support infrastructure construction. This study examined variables that influenced rural residents' comparatively early adoption of information technologies at a time when the rural-urban digital divide in the use of basic online services was still growing. The study found employment by a company that was using specific information technologies was the strongest predictor of individual adoption. The effect was particularly strong among those with less formal education. The findings suggest rural development specialists should focus on encouraging locally owned rural businesses to adopt information technologies as a means of maximizing local diffusion and increasing demand levels. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

By the convergence of legal and organizational issues we refer to two important aspects of urban government: (1) the close relationship between legal/policy structures and the way government is organized and functions, and (2) the way the legal/policy elements interact with organizational dynamics and work cultures to influence digital government projects (and government activities generally). It is our contention that convergence in the organizational and legal/policy context is a powerful determinant of how these projects develop and how likely they are to succeed. Therefore the understanding of this convergence and related dynamics is critically important to planning and designing both policy to promote digital government and particular digital government projects themselves. Illustrations of this convergence and its consequences are presented. They are based on research involving two digital government projects in urban settings: development of a management information system for homeless shelter administration and a developing a system for sharing information among New York City agencies. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.","",""

This article examines the impact of this transition on depository library operations - both collections and services - at the turn of the millennium. The discussion of reference service on depository materials is considered within the context of G. K. Zipf's law, that is, people will tend to seek the path of least effort in gathering information. Given this tendency, the extensive use of the Web to deliver electronic depository materials redirects depository library users away from depository shelves to Web workstations, and leads depository librarians to build Web pages to direct their patrons. The conclusion is that for depository libraries the new collection mix poses a management paradox - the FDLP receives thousands of tangible documents each year, yet it must maintain new services for patrons turning increasingly to Web-based resources.","",""

State sponsored monopolies are inimical to open government and rule of law because they open the possibility of censorship, because they raise prices and increase cost, and because they deprive the public of new technology developments.

At the same time, there is little discussion of the information policies of IGOs regarding access to IGO information. In fact, the freedom of information debate, with few exceptions, has not been extended to include IGOs. Although IGOs are made up of governmental bodies, the role of the IGO seems to be that of facilitator for state policy formation. This role fails to recognize that IGOs produce information of their own accord and make decisions which affect peoples in the member states. This article surveys the issue of access to IGO information and discusses how national debates can be extended to the IGO level. It shows both explicit and implicit information policies with case studies from the environmental information field: the European Union's (EU) directive on environmental information, and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). Three issues emerge: these are varying levels of access to IGO information, varying levels of IGO information policy, and a relative paucity of research on the subject. The principles of accountability, transparency, and public involvement are being made explicit more frequently in the documents of IGOs.

The main thesis of this paper is that this necessary transformation in public sector governance and accountability is likely to be blocked by an administrative culture that may be ill suited for a digital world. In terms of how governments respond, our two sets of explanatory factors will be determinant. First, partnerships, and the emergence of new collaborative dialogues within government, between governments, and across sectors are a critical dimension. The second, and quite related variable lies in the necessary leadership of people -new skill sets, and new leaders will be required to both empower knowledge workers and defend experimental action. Yet, it is not only the skills composition of workers altering in a digital era, but rather the broader transformations of both everyday and organizational life that are also at play. In this sense, digital government must reposition itself to become an engaged and constructive partner in shaping the new governance patterns that will otherwise render it rudderless. Government must produce a new ""culture"" in order to harness the enormous potential of digital government. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.","",""

The article looks at the Secretary of Internal Affairs' latest restructuring scheme, to establish a Heritage New Zealand group within the Department which will encompass the National Archives. In order to place the scheme in an historical context, the following issues are examined: independence for National Archives; the institution's problems in fulfilling a records management role; and the relationship between historians and archivists in New Zealand. The political motives, and funding and legal implications of this restructuring are also analyzed, as is the connection of the scheme to the debate over the tension between the evidential versus cultural/heritage role of archives.

The planning stages of e-government amount to triage: which specific municipal functions and services can a municipality afford to implement (or which services can they afford not to implement) given the costs of technology and technological capability? Little in the way of defining the leading edge of innovation among cities exists. To date, the literature on e-government ""best practices"" tends to stress creating standards for evaluating web-enabled services rather than for benchmarking the actual status of e-government implementation. In other words, a well-developed literature is emerging around standards by which municipal websites can be evaluated such as navigability and content standards. These standards do not give us insight, however, into the specific functions and services as they emerge on municipality websites. As a means toward addressing this lacuna, the authors created a rubric for benchmarking implementation among cities nationwide using a broad range of functional dimensions and assigning municipalities ""e-scores.""

It also promoted coordinated information management activities on a governmentwide basis by the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and prescribed information management responsibilities for the executive agencies. The management focus of the PRA was sharpened with the 1986 amendments which refined the concept of ""information resources management"" (IRM), defined as ""the planning, budgeting, organizing, directing, training, promoting, controlling, and management activities associated with the burden, collection, creation, use, and dissemination of information by agencies, and includes the management of information and related resources such as automatic data processing equipment."" This key term and its subset concepts received further definition and explanation in the PRA of 1995, making IRM a tool for managing the contribution of information activities to program performance, and for managing related resources, such as personnel, equipment, funds, and technology. The PRA currently authorizes appropriations for its administration by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), located within OMB, through FY2001 (44 U.S.C. 3520). Reauthorization of OIRA appropriations provides an opportunity to upgrade the PRA's provisions and to address prevailing government information management issues.","",""

While this concept and requirement has been on the federal agenda since the 1970s, it has not successfully diffused to the city and county levels of government. This does not reflect, however, mismanagement of their information resources. Rather, it is indicative of a bottom-up development of information technology management. A history of trying out many different approaches to information resources management has enabled local governments to evolve practices, and in some cases, policies, that fit their needs. Local governments are concerned with the provision of information and services to a citizenry who are also local, not distant and once removed, as at the federal level. This more direct need for access to information and real-time service delivery has led to the evolution of local information management responses which meet these needs in a timely fashion. The value of information is seen in its ability to create access to government and to insure the provision of services to the local public. This article will examine the range and forms of IRM practiced in city and county governments. It will examine IRM as initially instituted at the federal level and analyze the resultant management practices at the local level. The variables which lead to differences in practice will be discussed.

By reconceptualizing universal service subsidies in this way, one can obtain a more realistic assessment of the proper scope and limits of universal service policies. Universal service policies, at best, can play a supplementary role. Economic reforms that encourage investment and promote robust competition are more fundamental to the development of an ubiquitous infrastructure than government subsidies. The redistribution of wealth via telecommunications can ameliorate inequalities, but it cannot eliminate their causes, and advocates should stop pretending that it can. Furthermore, universal service advocates must become more aware of the political and economic risks and pitfalls that are inherent in the process of wealth redistribution.","",""

Meanwhile, however, the European Commission issued a directive limiting certain uses of electronic databases, broadly enough drafted to include electronic repositories of primary legal information. This kind of state-sponsored monopoly over public information is inimical to a rule of law and democratic values.

Moving governments onto the WWW represents a paradigm shift in the use of technology, and some governments are moving faster and are becoming more innovative than others. Governments are clearly becoming ""cyberactive"" but are emphasizing information and services for business and other economic development activities rather than dissemination of policy information, encouraging policy discussions, or delivering public services.

The ASP model helps local governments overcome barriers to offering next wave e-government services such as a shortage of skilled IT staff and limited financial resources.

Five conditions that favor the decision to use an ASP are (1) strong top management support, (2) promise of large efficiency gains, (3) enough IT capability on the part of the government unit to identify key piece of technology, (4) less burdensome outsourcing rules and procedures, and (5) a variety of high quality and reliable ASPs from which to choose locally. To ensure the success of an ASP project, local governments need to build in-house IT capability to evaluate an ASP and to develop proper performance measures. Management should focus on serving citizens and businesses and develop the capability to negotiate as well as manage service-level contracts with ASPs.

The realization of these goals will require a range of new educational program initiatives to retrain and retool government officials, especially those engaged in information resources management (IRM). If these initiatives to reinvent government are to occur successfully, the administration and Congress must create a major program initiative-with adequate financial support-to revamp the educational programs that support IRM. Simply put, the changes occurring in both information technology and in managing that technology are outpacing many government officials' ability to respond in a planned and coherent fashion. Moreover, the existing infrastructure to develop Federal IRM education and training is fragmented and poorly supported, lacks clear policy direction, and desperately needs updating and reconceptualization. © 1995.","",""

Federal agencies are enjoined from making a profit on their information products and permitted only to recover costs. The real question is how much value agencies should add to their information strictly for the public's use. Practical considerations such as the administrative costs of fees and legal authority to receive revenues condition an agency's decision to begin user fees. Various factors such as allowable costs and differential pricing must be considered in computing users' fees.

The CRDB Program is designed to engage the expertise available at State geological surveys in compiling best current State-level estimates of both quantities and quality of available coal reserves through cooperative agreements with EIA. The CRDB emphasizes integration of more data on coal quality, use of data from unpublished sources, cooperation with industry and other government sources, and flexibility of criteria to take into account local accessibility and mining conditions and utilize computerized geographic information systems or coal resource software. The results of pilot projects in Ohio and Wyoming are summarized. Areas nominated for support in the program include 15 additional priority coal regions in 14 States, which comprise 95 percent of the current reserve estimates and most of the coal-bearing areas of low sulfur potential. © 1993.","",""

As with many other earlier efforts of reform, the recent ""Reinventing Access to Federal Government Information,"" held in October 1993, would raise doubts, once again, about the public institutions and national information policy arrangements that support the Government Printing Office and its DLP. The specific reforms calling for centralized information should be abandoned. The depository library system's political power and public convictions were never fully expressed through the program's various national administrative incarnations. Its true community purpose flows from the local conditions and information needs of each depository library community. Democratic distribution of public information must begin and end within these local areas and regions. © 1994.","",""

This effort called for the pooling of information from a wide variety of sources about utility fuel use, capacity, generation, plant configurations, and other operational data. It also called for extensive analytic effort to estimate the impacts of the provisions of the CAA on the electricity and coal markets. After the CAA was enacted in November 1990, EIA assisted the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the development of the National Allowance Database. EIA compiled data for all utility fossil-steam power plants operating from 1985 through 1987, and new utility units that have announced plans to come on line by December 31, 1995. The EPA will use these data to calculate the final allocation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission allowances among all affected generating units in the United States. This process illustrates how an independent government statistical agency, while not directly involved in policy formulation, can provide support and assistance to policymakers in the development and implementation of laws. While the provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) were still being debated, Congress requested the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to review and analyze the sections that would affect electric utilities, specifically those relating to acid deposition (Title IV). By providing knowledgeable and impartial analysis, EIA clarified the likely effects of the various legislative proposals and helped Congress finalize the amendments. Even though the CAA is now law, EIA's efforts have not ended. During the analysis of the various proposals, EIA and EPA created a National Allowance Database (NAD). Now, under an agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a new version of the NAD is being developed to facilitate the implementation of the acid deposition provisions of the CAA.

The first publicly available products from this effort-extracts from the TIGER database called the TIGER/Line files-have been available in computer-readable form for the past 8 months, and paper maps produced by the TIGER System have been mailed to every functioning unit of local government in the United States within the past 4 months, including counties (and statistically equivalent areas), county subdivisions (townships, towns, and so forth), incorporated places (cities, villages, and so forth), federally and state-recognized American Indian areas, and Alaska Native villages. The greatest potential opportunity for applications outside the Census Bureau is for data analysts to use these files in conjunction with the increasingly available technology called geographic information systems, or GIS. Despite the magnitude of the accomplishment represented by the TIGER System, and the enormity of the potential applications for data analysts wishing to adopt GIS techniques, the Census Bureau has encountered substantial criticism recently because the content of the paper maps and the TIGER/Line files is not correct in every instance. In its continuing attempt to be responsive to the needs of its primary constituency-census data users-the Census Bureau has adopted a responsive policy regarding update of the TIGER database with the corrections annotated by its field enumerators as well as those identified by local officials. © 1990.","","12283615"

This article addresses the question of equitable access to electronic government information in one subject area, agriculture, where the Federal government has historically exercised a strong, proactive role in information dissemination. Issues considered include the impact of electronic technologies on existing dissemination structures, the Reagan era policy shift toward privatization of information dissemination, and factors influencing agriculturalists' abilities to access electronic information. A user-centered definition of the agricultural ""information public"" is then offered.

Begun on a purely experimental basis with relatively crude imaging systems, space remote sensing has become a source of remarkably detailed land management information that is available in GIS-compatible digital format on a regular basis globally. At the same time, providing satellite remote sensing data products to data users has become a rapidly expanding commercial enterprise of international scale. To this juncture, a critical factor limiting the application of satellite data in day-to-day land management at virtually all levels of government has been the ambivalence with which the U.S. has developed and administered its space remote sensing policy at the national level. That is, the political-institutional process leading to the ""privatization"" of the U.S. Landsat program has been an extremely convoluted one that has been replete with complex policy issues. While literally scheduled for termination during the spring of 1989, the Landsat program has since received renewed governmental attention and support. The National Space Council and the Office of Management and Budget are currently reviewing options aimed at ensuring the program's long-term continuation. Given both the technical and institutional evolution of space remote sensing internationally, satellite data are certain to become a primary GIS data source across the local to global continuum of GIS applications.

The article reviews the current state of GIS, arguing that it is a loose consortium of interests held together by common hardware and software solutions. The NCGIA is particularly concerned with the role of GIS within the broad scientific community. Research is organized as a series of initiatives, of which six are currently under way, focused on specific sets of impediments. Issues facing the Center and affecting its future research directions include the balance between basic and applied research, education and training, social and physical sciences, and scientific and infrastructural applications of GIS.

The agencies differed on key dimensions such as size, environmental complexity, environmental turbulence, and other relevant attributes. Each agency in the state goes through a regular two-year IT planning cycle which is guided by a centralized IT planning agency, the Information Resource Commission (IRC).

Because of its value, STI can be protected as intellectual property. Under this protection, constraints, controls, and exclusivity may be imposed on the use, reproduction, disclosure, and further dissemination of the information. While protection as intellectual property has always been possible and has been applied to some degree, government policies have changed drastically in recent years to encourage, if not actually require, more intellectual property rights protection of federally funded research and development (R&D) activities. This article discusses some of the reasons behind these changes and the effect of the changes on the more traditional approaches to the dissemination of federally funded STI; it includes predictions as to what may occur in the future. © 1990.","",""

Consequently, both American domestic and foreign policy became permeated by a more strident anti-communist attitude, manifesting itself in increased defense spending and preparations, expanded internal security procedures, broadened official secrecy arrangements, more vigorous enforcement of laws restricting the availability of information and goods of possible benefit to hostile nations, and pursuit of new authority for more strictly controlling the acquisition of American scientific and technological knowledge and commodities by foreign interests. These efforts were justified in terms of ""national security.""

Demands for more frequent enumerations and current data were major factors in the establishment of a permanent census office in 1902. The twentieth century featured censuses of manufactures every 2 years and later at 5-year intervals, and the addition of quinquennial censuses of retail and wholesale trade, service industries, construction, and transportation. In the 1950s, the censuses were integrated to ensure complete, unduplicated, comparable data for all of their components.

These three techniques have been used with varying degrees of success. Most recently, the Thatcher government has attempted to enjoin publication and distribution of Spycatcher, a book by former MI5 agent Peter Wright, in Australia. Several London newspapers were found in contempt for publishing summaries or extracts from the manuscript. Temporary injunctions, upheld by the Law Lords in July 1987, forbade the newspapers to publish details of the Wright trial as well as the contents of his book. Attempts by the government to obtain permanent injunctions have so far been unsuccessful, but await final disposition by the House of Lords in July 1988.

Some of these countries have undertaken a full economic census in recent years, while others have limited their census activities to sectors of particular importance. Organizations, such as the Agency for International Development and the World Bank, have provided some assistance to developing nations that are contemplating conducting a complete census by developing standard questionnaires and both tabulation and programming modules, in addition to providing technical assistance and training programs. © 1987.","",""

Fifty-five active providers of local government information (those that received requests for this information at least every two weeks) were identified: the findings are based on telephone and group interviews with key staff of those libraries.

Through the use of electronic information systems, it also has the opportunity to make more government information readily available to more public users. Defining the appropriate uses of, and controls on, this power are of critical importance in determining whether the government will be a positive or a negative force, particularly with respect to the private sector. Although there has always been, and probably always will be, some competition between government and private sector information products and services, there is agreement that the laws and policies regulating government information practices do not, and should not, require or permit a Federal agency to provide information products and services in the same manner as a private company. Federal agencies must be careful not to exploit the power inherent in electronic data systems by providing nonessential services to the public simply because the capability to provide such services exists. Instead the government should assume an affirmative obligation to review each electronic information activity carefully in order to avoid unnecessary government interference in the marketplace for information products and services. Further, as the government becomes increasingly involved in the use of electronic collection and dissemination, it must also learn to differentiate among levels of service and requirements of various user communities.

Today government is faced with increased budget constraints at the same time that investments in information technology are more critical for scientific research. For example, potential difficulties in extending the limits of existing technology may require increased support so that scientists can have access to state-of-the-art computer and telecommunications technologies. Policymakers are faced with a need to examine various alternatives for supplying scientists with the access to data and information technology necessary for their research. In addition to problems arising from budget austerity, a number of other issues exist. These include the policy of increased reliance on the private sector, the impact of international competition in information technology, the need for access to and dissemination of domestic and foreign scientific and technical information, and the need for coordinated national policies for both scientific and technical information and information technology development.

Congress was denied the information it needed to discharge constitutional responsibilities, requiring it to reassert legislative prerogatives by tightening oversight statutes and scrutinizing presidential nominees who had some involvement in Iran-Contra. As a result of prosecutions by the Independent Counsel, a number of Executive officials and private citizens who participated in Iran-Contra have already pled guilty or been found guilty by Federal juries.

When the delegates agreed on State representation in the Senate and proportional representation in the House, they wrote a census clause into the Constitution to ensure periodic adjustments. During the nineteenth century, the volume of census questions increased dramatically, provoking criticisms of census accuracy and calls for a permanent Census Bureau, established in 1902. In recent times, major innovations in census work have improved accuracy and timeliness, along with more popular interest in the enumeration. For the 1980 census, many people wanted to help set the stage for the census, and most people want to be counted, continuing the best traditions of 200 years. © 1985.","",""

Particular attention was paid to differences between dates of distribution and cataloging for sales publications, for all titles cataloged by the Government Printing Office, and for those cataloged by the Library of Congress. Patterns relating to document distribution as well as to cataloging practices were discernible from survey results and are presented here. Major findings may be summarized as follows: 1) not all depository monographs are cataloged by the Government Printing Office; 2) sales publications are cataloged quickly, often before distribution by GPO; 3) the quality of cataloging records for depository documents available on OCLC is generally high; 4) the Library of Congress catalogs relatively few depository documents and is comparatively slow to do so; and 5) many different types of OCLC member libraries catalog federal depository documents, often before GPO does.

Such controls, however, may have a restrictive effect not only on scientific communication, but also on scientific achievement and advancement in the United States.

It also highlights individual documents collections and addresses issues pertinent to forthcoming government policies and regulations. Many law libraries have become selective depository libraries under provision of Public Law 95-261 passed on April 17, 1978. The Law Library at Southern Illinois University is one such selective depository library. The decision about whether to integrate or separate documents is usually based on the local situation, and the decision of this library to integrate depository documents into the collection was made after reviewing local library factors. This article describes the practices of managing an integrated documents collection including technical processing of paper and microfiche documents, collection development and maintenance, and reference service. © 1985.","",""

This study examines the impact of that action on the format and content of printed publications, issued during the freeze, by the Department of Health and Human Services. Analysis of those publications distributed to Government Printing Office depository libraries during the moratorium reflected: (1) no significant reduction in the number of documents produced, (2) a shift toward smaller, less-costly print formats, and (3) no significant reduction in the release of publicity/advertising materials. Changes observed in the quantity, format, and content of Department of Health and Human Services publications issued during the moratorium were not those expected given the presidential guidelines. © 1984.","",""

Every 10 years, the Bureau of the Census conducts that enumeration, and using the Method of Equal Proportions designated by the Congress, furnishes to the President the number of Representatives to which each state is entitled. ""Rules of residence"" have been developed to determine who should be counted and where persons should be counted in the census. Following the 1970 census, because of the Supreme Court's decisions requiring population equality in districts used for electoral purposes, census data became vital to the redistricting processes carried out by the individual states. The Congress enacted Public Law 94-171 which authorized the Bureau of the Census to make special preparations for the provision of redistricting data needed by the 50 states. The 1980 program established by the Census Bureau enabled state redistricting to be accomplished far more smoothly than in the 1970s. The Census Bureau is already working with the states on its 1990 program, an essential element of which is based upon its plan to provide block data for the entire country. © 1985.","",""
