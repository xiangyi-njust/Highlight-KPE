Although the research has shown their significant presence, value, and effectiveness in providing services for their communities, there is the persistent questioning of value and efficiency of public libraries by some, which leads to continuous and severe funding cuts for public libraries. This study addresses the efficiency issue of public libraries. The previous research on this issue is inconclusive because of deficiencies in methodologies, such as the use of circulation as the single measure for library outputs while ignoring all other library services. This study applies a well-established cost function with multiple output measures to over 1600 public libraries in the United States. This study concludes that public libraries as a whole operate efficiently and argues for sustained and continuous funding for public libraries. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Budget; Cost function; Efficiency; Funding; Information services; Library costs; Public libraries; Scale economies; United States; Value",""

STEM liaison librarians from a sampling frame of 135 at 16 similarly Association of Research Libraries were surveyed with demographic and job analysis questions. A total of 41 participants completed the entirety of the survey. Findings indicate the majority of respondents serve 4 or more departments and continue to spend a majority of their time on traditional liaison tasks, but data-related duties are in greater demand. In these continually uncertain times with dwindling resources in academic libraries, a clearer picture of STEM liaison librarian tasks and the duration expended on each helps inform staffing of services. A better understanding of these duties and their frequency will add value to more accurate job descriptions, relevant curriculum, and training, as well as advance the understanding of what these information professionals do with their work time as well as tell us what they no longer do as much. © 2023","Academic libraries; Collection development; Engagement; Instruction services; Job analyses; Liaison librarian; Outreach; Research data; Research support; Science librarian; Survey",""

Furthermore, earlier researches on the connection between ICT and growth concentrated more on general expansion than on the kind of growth that is evenly distributed and has broader societal implications than merely growing the size of the overall economic pie. This study critically analyzes the connection between ICT diffusion and inclusive growth, considering the interactive impacts of trade openness, FDI, and financial inclusion on inclusive growth in top African nations ranked in terms of ICT development, so as to close the existing literature gap. An improved-GMM (generalized method of moments) technique, founded on panel data-set spanning the years 2000–2020, is used in the study. By employing PCA (principal component analysis) to measure inclusive growth, ICT diffusion, and financial inclusion indices, the study contributes to the body of prior research. The model also accounts for the heterogeneous impact of the interactive term between ICT diffusions and trade openness, FDI, and financial inclusion on inclusive growth. Overall, results indicate that while ICT diffusion, trade openness, FDI, and financial inclusion significantly and positively enhance inclusive growth at both the individual and interaction levels, inflation hinders it. The study suggests that policymakers should establish measures to advance ICT development, encourage trade openness, attract foreign direct investment, and improve financial inclusion because these measures have tendencies to support inclusive growth by opening up a number of opportunities. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","FDI; Financial inclusion; ICT development; Inclusive growth; Trade",""

The findings of this study reveal a positive and significant effect of mobile money adoption on school enrolment, but a negative effect on children's labour market activities. Moreover, the study identifies heterogenous impacts across child's gender and age; and remittances receipt and education expenditure are the potential pathways through which mobile money adoption affects child labour and school enrolment.

Nevertheless, does the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) improve agricultural households' welfare? To answer this, the study used a nationally representative household survey, the Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis (CFSVA) carried out in 2017 in Benin. The survey covered a sample of 15 000 households, however, the analysis focused on the 6502 agricultural households. An endogenous switching regression model was employed to control for selection bias and endogeneity issues. Results indicated that the use of ICT increases households' consumption expenditure by 89.6%. This implies that the use of ICT improves agricultural households' welfare. Other variables that affect agricultural households’ welfare include age, marital status, farm size, access to credit, ownership of livestock, membership in a farmer-based organization, and region of residence. Furthermore, the decision to use ICT in agricultural households depends on the level of education, age, sex, marital status, farm size, access to credit, ownership of livestock, membership in a farmer based organization, and location. These findings suggest that policies that promote the use of ICT are key to improving welfare of agricultural households in Benin.

Data enclosure is the process by which the information about user activity generated by digital operations are withdrawn from an open or shared arrangement with other operators and made more exclusive to the service providers whose operations generate the data. We make the case that data enclosure is emerging as a significant feature of the multi-sided markets of digital platform providers, by looking empirically at, 1) the encryption of DNS query data using the DNS over HTTPS (DoH) protocol, and 2) the enclosure of Apple and Google's mobile identifiers used in digital advertising and cross-app user tracking. These efforts are not only privacy-enhancing moves, but also a means by which service providers compete with each other over the value and security of data. We assess the degree to which exclusivity of data fosters or forecloses competition in the relevant markets, and find mixed results. DoH, apparently a more disruptive form of data enclosure, has had little impact on industry shares so far, primarily because it was embraced by a small-share, declining actor, but the growing use of DoH and other encrypted DNS protocols does indicate a market-driven response to privacy-enhancement. In mobile identifiers in adtech, the shift in the default from opt-out permission to opt-in permission had both strong privacy effects and major effects on the distribution of revenues in the industry. But the changes are recent and the situation remains unsettled. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Competition; Data enclosure; Digital political economy; Platforms; Privacy; Property rights",""

In contrast to previous literature, we measured basic broadband and new fiber-based wireline broadband and 3G/4G mobile broadband network deployment. We also captured variations in end-user devices, ICT affinity, and famous online content. We found that, on average, the CO2-reducing effects appear to outweigh the CO2-increasing effects. In particular, we found that, in addition to the reduction effect associated with the use of basic broadband connections, there is a further, albeit smaller, reduction effect associated with new fiber-based broadband connections.

We distinguish between different connectivity speed levels by aggregating the available regional data across all existing broadband technologies, and investigate how regional differences in the contribution of broadband coverage to real economic growth can quantitatively explain the persistence of the European urban-rural digital divide. In order to make our results robust to endogeneity and disaggregated data availability issues, we employ a bootstrap-based bias correction for the dynamic fixed effects estimator. We find that expansions in the provision of lower-speed broadband access accelerated annual per capita growth in both urban and rural regions through diminishing returns to scale, but that the effects were weaker in those regions characterized by larger ruralization. High-speed broadband coverage, on the contrary, could only be significantly related to rural economic growth and had no impact within their urban counterparts. We find evidence that the costs of these high-speed rural connectivity expansions had not yet been offset, but that they exhibit increasing returns to scale with cut-off levels nearing full coverage. These results indicate that the high-speed digital expansion of rural Europe is a potential gamechanger for further rural development policies through its role as a general-purpose infrastructure, and consequently argue in favour of increased efforts to close the urban-rural digital gap. © 2023 The Authors","Broadband access; Broadband coverage; Digital divide; Regional economic growth; Rural development; Urban-rural digital divide",""

New electronic communications services ensuring specific QoS levels are subject to EU-net neutrality rules laid down in Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 and are currently being assessed by national regulatory authorities (NRAs) on a case-by-case basis. As acknowledged by the European Commission (EC) in its recent report on the implementation of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2015/2120, this case-by-case approach results in legal uncertainty and acts as barrier to investments and innovation.

From a merger policy perspective, our contribution is two-fold. First, we conclude that mergers may benefit consumers even in the absence of any cost-related efficiencies and establish under which circumstances this is more likely to occur. Second, our results also indicate that when the merger has a negative impact on consumer surplus, remedies based on reallocation of spectrum are not very likely to change this outcome. The reason is that the circumstances under which the merger is unlikely to benefit consumers are precisely those under which spectrum reallocation will be unable to fix merger-induced anticompetitive effects. © 2023 The Author(s)","Divestiture; Horizontal differentiation; Mergers; Spectrum assets; Vertical differentiation",""

Thus, wireless traffic grows in volume and complexity, making prediction, investment planning, and regulation increasingly difficult. This article characterizes urban wireless traffic evolution, supporting operators to drive mobile network evolution and policymakers to increase national and local competitiveness. We propose a holistic method that widens previous research scope, including new devices and the effect of policy from multiple government levels. We provide an analytical formulation that combines existing complementary methods on traffic evolution research and diverse data sources. Results for a centric area of Helsinki during 2020–2030 indicate that daily volumes increase, albeit a surprisingly large part of the traffic continues to be generated by smartphones. Machine traffic gains importance, driven by surveillance video cameras and connected cars. While camera traffic is sensitive to law enforcement policies and data regulation, car traffic is less affected by transport electrification policy. High-priority traffic remains small, even under encouraging autonomous vehicle policies. Based on peak hour results, we suggest that 5G small cells might be needed around 2025, albeit the utilization of novel radio technology and additional mid-band spectrum could delay this need until 2029. We argue that mobile network operators inevitably need to cooperate in constructing a single, shared small cell network to mitigate the high deployment costs of massively deploying small cells. We also provide guidance to local and national policymakers for IoT-enabled competitive gains via the mitigation of five bottlenecks. For example, local monopolies for mmWave connectivity should be facilitated on space-limited urban furniture or risk an eventual capacity crunch, slowing down digitalization. © 2023","Internet of things; Smart city; Telecom policy; Traffic evolution; Wireless traffic",""

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries accelerated their digital transformation processes, and it is widely believed the COVID-19 pandemic has deepened existing inequalities in the digital realm. Yet, few studies have empirically examined whether digital inequalities in the labor market increased during the pandemic. This analysis studies how the COVID-19 pandemic affected Chinese workers' Internet usage and how this influence varied across socioeconomic groups. By using the ordered probit model and leveraging the most recent data from the China Family Panel Studies and the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, we find that the pandemic significantly increased the overall level of Internet usage in the country, and the mediating effects of the perceived importance of the Internet and access to the Internet are confirmed. As Internet usage increased, digital inequalities in China's labor market deepened, especially among young and wealthy workers with high social status in urban areas, while older and poorer workers in rural areas benefited less from this new ‘digital wave.’ Moreover, during the pandemic, Internet usage increased among employees working in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which suggests a growing digital inequality gap between SOEs and other sectors. Following a series of robustness tests, our research findings remain valid.

Policy makers, regulators, and network operators are in need to understand the amount of capital required to address this gap and generate solid evidence upon which policy options and regulatory remedies should be discussed. To date, most studies aimed at estimating the investment associated with broadband deployment have consisted in ad-hoc approaches based on cost modelling from average estimations, which lack rigor in terms of considering differences in technologies, topography, and population density. In this paper we propose a general approach, based on the use of Unconditional Quantile Regressions (UQR), that addresses the heterogeneities that arise from considering differentiated coverage targets and investment required across the different deployment phases. Our tool was found to successfully account for the increasing investment to fulfil coverage targets. Moreover, it can be applicable to a wide range of countries, as robustness checks conducted provided evidence of being suitable, to some extent, for countries with more geographic challenges (e.g., mountains, forests, etc.). On this basis, the estimated UQR coefficients were also used to simulate 4G, 5G and FTTH expansion for scenarios of accelerated deployments in Latin America, by trading off cost and target network quality requirements. We simulated some coverage goals above the current trends for 2030, targeting on average 98% of the population covered by 4G, 80% of the population covered by 5G, and two-thirds of households passed by FTTH. For the overall Latin America region, the extra capital needed above current investment trends accounts for $ 17,101 million over the period 2023–2029. Considering this challenge, potential regulatory remedies are considered. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","4G; 5G; Broadband; Coverage; Digital divide; FTTH; Investment",""

The novel arrangement, which creates a perpetual obligation rather than simply a one-off transfer, appears to settle a long-standing dispute between the Māori indigenous people of New Zealand and the Government regarding a claim under an 1840 treaty that Māori were entitled to a share of spectrum due to their historic property rights and the Government's obligation to ensure that their language could flourish. Further support apparently derives from New Zealand's obligations as a signatory to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The decision is notable for the lack of analysis of the expected effects on long-standing sector competition and efficiency objectives in the New Zealand telecommunications industry. Importantly, it introduces a tension into New Zealand spectrum policy between the (historic) allocation of spectrum rights to achieve the most economically efficient future outcome for the benefit of all New Zealanders (including all Māori), and the (post-memorandum) allocation where a preferential set-aside has been created to address a narrow distributional objective in spectrum “ownership” and governance involving only a subset of the population identifying as Māori. While raising the latter question, this paper addresses the competition and economic efficiency issues absent so far in official consideration of the arrangement. Using comparative economic and policy analysis, we find that while wealth and control is transferred from the Crown to the Māori entity, the Māori entity faces very different opportunities and incentives to deploy the spectrum in the most socially-useful manner compared to commercial operators. The “set-aside” creates both artificial scarcity for commercial spectrum and alters the strategic options for all parties due to the Māori rights being perpetual and not subject to the same terms and conditions as commercial spectrum. Additional burdens are imposed on New Zealand telecommunications service consumers not borne by those in jurisdictions without such policies, and relative to the counterfactual of full open auction of the relevant rights. We conclude that the agreement effectively subjugates sector competition and efficiency objectives to distributional concerns. Furthermore, granting specific policy development rights to the Māori entity suggests the agreement is not simply a vehicle for administering Māori spectrum but instead establishes a constitutional “co-governance” partnership between a state agency and the Māori entity governing future New Zealand spectrum policy. These fundamental changes to spectrum policy are unprecedented internationally. © 2023 The Authors","Indigenous rights; New Zealand; Spectrum policy; Telecommunications markets",""

The analysis revealed that internet use assisted rural households, including the poor ones, in fostering their livelihoods in the 2008–2016 period: (1) internet access increased the average annual household income per capita by 4.5 million Vietnamese dongs, accounting for at least 17% of the overall income; (2) it decreased the probability of being poor by around 4%.

To this end, we measure firms’ innovation investment behavior through average total research and development (R&D) expenditures per filed patent family for publicly listed firms from 1999 to 2018. Our sample mainly includes major SEP family declarants. We rely on a binary business model taxonomy differentiating upstream and downstream firms. Within that setting, total R&D expenditures rise with increasing fragmentation of declared SEP families, suggesting that firms adjust their R&D investments to declaration developments in standard-setting organizations (SSOs). We also show that upstream firms have significantly lower total R&D expenditures than downstream firms, which could indicate structural differences in their intellectual property (IP) and R&D management processes.

Specifically, economic performance is measured by total factor productivity (TFP) growth and financial performance is examined in terms of factors explaining accounting and market returns with the aid of seventy-six firm data set over a twelve year period (2004–2016). While thirty years of rapid development in the Indian IT services export sector is well documented, this paper suggests that much of the growth is attributable to replication rather than innovation. Results support the proposition that growth in the real output of Indian IT services sector is predominantly due to growth in real inputs (96%), as TFP accounts for only 4%. In addition, our estimation of Cobb-Douglas production function suggests modest economies of scale in the range of 1.06–1.14. With respect to financial performance, regression results confirm the important role of asset turnover, dividends, and debt in explaining accounting return measured by return on assets (39% adjusted R2). On the other hand, as expected, regression results explain only 10–14% (adjusted R2) of market return, which is total return on stocks including dividends.

Controlling for demand conditions, we find that digitally-enabled firms faced a lower decline in sales by about 4 percentage points during the pandemic compared to digitally-constrained firms, suggesting that digitalization acted as a hedge during the pandemic.

In the study of the governance of communication networks governance in science and technology studies, traditionally the emphasis has been on sociotechnical imaginaries (Jasanoff & Kim, 2015) which encapsulate joint futures that produce institutional configurations and the discursive roles in the power tussle between various stakeholders. I argue that next to the studying of power over infrastructures and their governance by sociotechnical imaginaries, there is an increasing need to study how power is distributed and control is exercised through the shaping of the technological materiality of infrastructures, as is happening for instance in the process of standardization. To describe the workings of the distribution of power and the exercising of control through networks, governance, and standardization, I expand the concept of network ideologies (Bory, 2020) to show how several network ideologies are at play in the shaping of 5G networks. I base my analysis on the qualitative analysis of standard-setting processes through document analysis of mailinglist conversations, standards, and policy documents, as well as through the parallel operation of experimental 5G networks. The analysis shows that sociotechnical imaginaries are insufficient to show the political process of the distribution of power and opportunities for control through the production of transnational communication infrastructures. The notion of network ideologies might provide a basis to study the merging of internet and telecommunication infrastructures, their standard-setting, and their governance as well as the excommunication of the user by relinquishing its ability to understand and configure infrastructures. © 2022 The Author","",""

We take stock from recent economic literature and empirical evidences to show the differences in business models and regulatory constraints have led to unequal net benefits from growing European digital economy. In particular, because the telecommunication operators have to bear the costs of delivering content to end-users, their business can be strongly affected due to the sharp increase in traffic generation. This negative externality should be internalized to correct the related market failure and to restore incentives to invest in the network infrastructure to meet the ambitious Europe's Digital Decade targets. Furthermore, we assess the interplay between access and content, and demonstrate how a fair cost sharing policy can impact investment, consumer surplus and social welfare. In particular, content providers that are efficient in monetizing consumers are incentivized to lower the cost of content to consumers, which positively impacts the consumer surplus and social welfare.

The empirical results suggest that the digital economy significantly promotes female employment. Consistent with our theoretical analysis, the estimates indicate that this relationship holds because the digital economy promotes the formation of egalitarian gender perspectives, promotes the use of digital technology, and increases labor demand emphasizing the necessity for female-preference occupations. The dividend of the digital economy is tilted toward vulnerable groups in the labor market, including the low-skilled, older, and rural workforce, and only exerts an employment promotion effect on women without parenting burden. Further examination reveals evidence that digitalization has not led to a holistic improvement in the quality of female employment. Digitalization lengthens the working hours of severely underemployed female workers, and improves women's occupational status and job satisfaction; however, it has a minimal impact on protecting employees' rights and interests or reducing overtime workers' work intensity. Nonself-employed, full-time, and part-time workers all benefit from the development of the digital economy, while self-employed workers do not. In addition, a weakening effect of digitalization on the gender employment gap is not evident, which relates to the digital economy generating a female dividend in terms of promoting gender equality and increasing labor demand but resulting in a digital gender divide in the use of digital technology. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Digital economy; Female employment; Gender equality perspectives; Labor demand; Use of digital technology",""

Narrative analysis is used to map how 30 expert activists from around the world, whose engagement is bound neither to state nor corporate interests, talk about how AI can be understood as a boon or a bane to inequality, both social and communicative. While common themes are in evidence (such as the need to safeguard people's right to own their own data), some noteworthy dissonances are also discernible (such as whether such people should be envisaged as individuals or collectivities). The narratives are critical in that they resist the impetus of rapid, and in some cases unfettered, technological advancement while at the same time pushing back against the apocalyptic AI narratives familiar from popular culture.

ICT development is measured with internet penetration, mobile penetration, broadband subscription, and telephone subscription. The causal effect of the BRI on ICT development is estimated using a propensity score reweighting difference-in-differences (DiD) model. We find that the participating economies experience a significant rise in ICT development. A country's participation in the Digital Silk Road (DSR) in addition to the BRI further increases its ICT development and increases its participation in global ICT value chains relative to their BRI-only counterparts. Overall, the benefit of participating in the BRI on ICT development is enhanced by participating in the DSR. However, there are unequal trade creation effects between China and the rest of the world. The participating economies increase their imports of computer and information services more from and increase their imports of communication services less from China than from the rest of the world after the participation. These results are robust to a parallel trend test, alternative ICT measures and alternative estimation methods. Finally, we highlight the implications of our results for policy makers in developing countries who want to improve their ICT development and to engage in global ICT value chains, and for academics in developing future research to evaluate these initiatives at the macro- and micro-levels. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Belt and road initiative; Digital silk road; Foreign direct investment; Global value chains; Information and communication technology",""

Based on this, this paper takes Chinese A-share listed companies from 2011 to 2018 as samples and China's National Comprehensive Big Data Pilot Zones (BDPZ) as a quasi-natural experiment. A difference-in-differences method was used to analyze the impact and transmission mechanism of the policy on the corporate sustainability. The results show that BDPZ policy can enhance the corporate sustainability and the reliability of the findings is demonstrated by a series of robustness tests. From the mechanism test, the BDPZ construction can strengthen the infrastructure effect, stimulate the talent effect and enhance the transaction effect to advance corporate digitalization and enhance their sustainability. From the heterogeneity analysis, the corporate sustainability enhancement effect of BDPZ construction is more significant for high-tech enterprises, but not for resource-intensive industries and enterprises in cross-regional type pilot zones.

One of the triggers is China's rise in 5G standardization and its lead in the telecommunications equipment market, which causes security concerns. In response, the U.S. promotes Open RAN as an alternative to the Chinese providers' proprietary solutions. It is claimed to enable the establishment and operation of open and safer networks for 5G and beyond. This paper examines why and how the U.S. promotes Open RAN and what the responses are from other countries. We find that the U.S. government's strong support for the development and dissemination of Open RAN signals its techno-nationalistic turn in international standardization. The origin of Open RAN is geopolitical in the sense that it represents a reaction to China's lead in 5G standardization. The geopolitical perspective is strengthened as we find the formation of alliances in support of Open RAN. A refreshed approach of the U.S. to standardization has introduced a new dynamic to cooperation and competition for setting the global rules on next-generation mobile communication technologies as well as emerging technologies.

In order to achieve its objectives, such an ambitious strategy must achieve a fusion of the digital and the physical activities in all sectors of the economy (public and private); in this task, achieving the policy goal of universal connectivity requires that it be efficient, while achieving equitable (or ‘fair’) results. The EU position is that an appropriate balance needs to be struck through regulation which pursues the twin goals of competition and investment, as is now required by the EECC. Over the past 20 years, the EU has benefitted from a successful regime of pro-competition regulation in telecommunications, which has transformed the structure of fixed markets and broadly maintained rivalry in the mobile market. However, the policy imperative of attaining universal high-speed connectivity requires the mobilisation of resources to cover remoter areas, which are less attractive to competitors. Government subsides may help, but in some Member States regulators may also have to dilute competitive pressure on the historic incumbent in order to elicit this investment. Possible ways of accomplishing this entirely legitimate task (and ensuring that the resources thus generated are applied to the relevant public purpose) are considered. In relation to 5G, questions arise about how much network sharing should be permitted to allow the construction of advanced stand-alone networks. Relevant competition cases in this area are also reviewed. Finally, the suggestion has seen made that network operators should receive resources transferred from the largest Over-The-Top operators (OTT), which are understood to be highly profitable and involved in, but which do not contribute to the cost of, infrastructure that can support the high proportion of Internet traffic.

While the existing studies have explored the effect of ICT on economic growth, there is a limited empirical study on the effect of ICT on poverty reduction.

Using the dynamic system-generalized method of moment estimator to control endogeneity, the findings show that telephone penetration, mobile phone penetration, and ICT goods imported contribute to poverty reduction, while internet penetration, broadband penetration, and ICT goods exported increase poverty rate regardless of gender and age group. The net effect estimates reveal that at the maximum value of most ICT variables, economic growth, income inequality, and access to credit significantly increase poverty rate regardless of the age group. We argue that for SSA to leverage ICT to drive economic prosperity, policies that seek to drive ICT availability and affordability should be supported with policies that ensure income redistribution, trickle-down development, and minimizing the cost of accessing credit. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Economic recovery; Information and communication technology; Poverty reduction; Sub-saharan Africa; Sustainable development goals",""

Unsurprisingly, this has led to concerns about their use by students in tertiary education contexts (Swiecki et al. 2022) and it has led to them being banned in some school districts in the United States (e.g. Rosenblatt 2023; Clarridge 2023) and from at least one top-ranking international university (e.g. Reuters 2023). There are legitimate reasons for such fears to be held, as it is difficult to differentiate students’ own written work presented for assessment from that produced by the AI tools. Successfully embedding them into educational contexts requires an understanding of the tools, what they are, and what they can and cannot do. Despite their powerful modelling and description capabilities, these tools have (at least currently) significant issues and limitations (Zhang & Li 2021). As telecommunications policy academics charged with the research-led teaching and supervising both undergraduate and research students, we need to be certain that our graduates are capable of understanding the complexities of current issues in this incredibly dynamic field and applying their learnings appropriately in industry and policy environments.

We found that while the outputs were well-written and appeared plausible, there were significant systematic errors which, once academics are aware of them, can be exploited to avoid the risk of AI use severely undermining the credibility of the assessments we make of students’ written work, at least for the time being and in respect of the version of chatbot software we used. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Academia; Artificial Intelligence (AI); ChatGPT; GPT-3",""

Faster upgrades could suggest that incumbents do so to deter public entry or that potential competition is quality-enhancing. Slower upgrades could suggest that public entry threats deter investment in quality. I find no evidence that cable providers’ upgrading behavior responds to the passage of a referendum.

Instead of market mechanisms, non-exclusive rights regimes can be analyzed through a lens of polycentricity, but such regimes require consensus on adaptable non-market governance rules and incentive-compatible mechanisms for monitoring, sanctioning, and exclusion of nonmembers.

It is the first such measure which specifically targets hate speech on social media, by requiring large platforms to operate complaints procedures which ensure illegal content is rapidly removed. Numerous other countries have since adopted similar regulations, indicating that states increasingly turn to new school speech regulation as a regulatory strategy to tackle hate speech on social media. This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of new school speech regulation in as a regulatory strategy to address online hate speech, taking NetzDG as a case study. A review of relevant empirical literature shows that many features of social media platforms actively promote or encourage hate speech. Key factors include algorithmic recommendations, which frequently promote hateful ideologies; social affordances which let users encourage or disseminate hate speech by others; anonymous, impersonal environments; and the absence of media ‘gatekeepers’. In mandating faster content deletion, NetzDG only addresses the last of these, ignoring other relevant factors. Moreover, reliance on individual user complaints to trigger platforms' obligations means hate speech will often escape deletion. Interviews with relevant civil society organisations confirm these flaws of the NetzDG model. From their perspectives, NetzDG has had little impact on the prevalence or visibility of online hate speech, and its reporting mechanisms fail to help affected communities. NetzDG represents an incremental, narrow approach to a complex sociotechnical problem which requires more fundamental regulatory reform. In this regard, it shows the limitations of censorship-based new school speech regulation. Rules which assert state authority by prescribing censorship of narrowly-defined content categories are ill-suited to large-scale, networked, algorithmically-curated social media, where other governance mechanisms influence user behaviour more than content deletion. The paper advocates a more systemic and preventive regulatory approach. Platforms should be required to take public interest considerations into account in all design and governance processes, aiming to shape platform environments to actively discourage users from posting or viewing hate speech, rather than simply deleting it afterwards. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Content moderation; Hate speech; netzdg; Platform regulation; Social media regulation",""

It models the factors associated with switching outcomes, including the direction of change in expenditure and whether those who are observed to switch plans tend to arrive at more or less optimal plans given their usage. A dataset is employed that combines survey responses from mobile consumers with the same consumers' actual usage data in the period 2017–2019; this was collected by Ireland's national regulatory authority. The cost each consumer would have incurred on every plan offered in the market based on their observed usage is estimated. Using models that allow for selection into switching, associations between switching outcomes and demographic and user characteristics are modelled. Controls are included for plan and user attributes, including demographics and proxies for user sophistication and access to alternative communication options. A substantial proportion of intra-operator switchers in the sample increase expenditures when they switch plan. While many switchers move to plans that are more optimal given their usage, a slight majority move to plans that charge a higher price premium over the best available plan (based on observables) than the consumer's previous plan did. Few observable characteristics of consumers or plans seem to be significantly associated with which switches achieve greater optimality, although fixed operator effects are large and significant. These findings add to the weight of evidence which finds that many consumers fail to arrive at the best price even after switching. © 2022 The Authors","Consumer choice; Consumer demand; Ireland; Microdata; Mobile telecommunications",""

Therefore, scholars have studied the participation of civil society organizations, from the first phase of the World Summit on the Information Society through to the most recent Internet Governance Forum, to understand how they engage in and shape internet governance. However, this category is not well defined; therefore, it is not always clear whose interests are being advanced by civil society organizations. This study evaluates representation in civil society by examining the annual RightsCon conference as an ideal site of civil society engagement in internet governance in order to evaluate the potential of multistakeholderism to achieve the goals of democratization, representation, and inclusion. Through a meso-level analysis of discursive production at RightsCon that operationalizes a critical geopolitical rubric, this study finds that organizations that represent interests from the Global North and West are highly over-represented in three ways: in leading overall discourse, in claiming authority over global issues, and in driving specific topics such as misinformation, privacy, and internet shutdowns.

While total tax revenue non-resource as a percentage of GDP and tax revenue as a percentage of GDP are used to proxy for tax revenue mobilization, three ICT measures are used, namely; the telephone penetration rate, the mobile phone penetration rate and internet penetration rate. To perform the analysis, we adopt the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The empirical findings are as follows. First, while the calculated net impacts are substantially positive, the corresponding marginal ICT effects utilized for calculating net effects are extremely negative. Second, an extensive study is carried out to determine complementing policy thresholds. These thresholds include: 21.959 (per 100 people) telephone penetration for total income from tax revenue; 16.333 (per 100 people) internet penetration for total income from tax; 21.125 internet penetration (per 100 people) for the income from the tax on non-resource income.

The Federal Communications Commission has detailed data on broadband subscriptions from its semi-annual Form 477 collection. The USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) releases a complete census of agriculture every five years to measure agricultural activity. By pairing periodic releases of the Form 477 data collection with information on farm production expenses and crop yields from corresponding releases of the Census of Agriculture, the analysis directly evaluates the benefit of rural broadband development on the U.S. farming industry. Overall, I find evidence of crop yield improvements from increased Internet penetration rates at thresholds of 25 Megabits-per-second download and 3 Megabits-per-second upload speeds. Among the findings, doubling the number of 25+/3+ connections per 1000 households is associated with a 3.79% increase in corn yields, as measured in bushels per acre. I also find some evidence of cost savings at thresholds of 10 Megabits-per-second download and 0.768 Megabits-per-second upload speeds. Doubling the number of 10+/0.768+ connections per 1000 households is associated with a 2.41% decrease in operating expenses per farm operation.

We advance this literature in this paper by shifting the focus of analysis to quality-based ICTs measures; in this case, Internet quality. We also extend the literature by examining how the envisaged relationship between ICTs quality and technical efficiency is conditioned by a country's unique attributes. Our results show a significantly positive effect of ICTs quality on technical efficiency. We also find that the technical efficiency gains associated with ICTs quality are higher in skill-abundant countries, countries that engage more intensively in cross-border trade, have stronger contracting institutions, and are endowed with well-functioning and well-developed financial markets that ensure greater efficiency of capital allocation. We find a network effect in the nexus between ICTs quality and technical efficiency. That is, the marginal effect of ICTs quality on technical efficiency increases as the number of Internet users expands.

The focus is on mobile network operators and their business opportunities in the public safety market. Purpose: The purpose of this research is to provide a review of ongoing public safety mobile broadband projects in which mobile operators play a key role. In addition, a business model analysis is presented to determine the role of mobile operators in these projects. A comparison of the two key business models is also included to reveal their general characteristics. Methods and data: The research used a qualitative method, an inductive case study. This method was used to draw general conclusions from a small number of case studies based on ongoing public safety mobile broadband projects. The Casadesus-Masanell and Ricart framework and the business model canvas were used to analyse and compare the two key business models discussed. Data were collected from a variety of sources, including company reports, press releases, international events and conferences, and selected interviews with managers in charge. Findings: The results show that mobile operators have new business opportunities in the public safety market. Their existing mobile networks can be used for public safety services with certain enhancements. Within existing projects, mobile operators have different business models. The two analysed models were found to require different resources and offer different business opportunities for mobile operators. Procurement authorities responsible for selecting business models are encouraged to pay attention to the choice of model based on, for example, strategic objectives. Value: Very little research has been done on the business opportunities of mobile operators in the public safety market. In this area, this study lays the groundwork for new research. Procurement authorities can use the results when deciding on the business model. Mobile operators can benefit from these results by better understanding their own roles in public safety projects and when assessing the business opportunities of a particular project. © 2022 The Authors","4G/5G; Business model; Mobile broadband; Mobile network operator; Public safety",""

South Korea, a developed country in terms of fixed broadband penetration, implemented two policies for rural broadband via fiber access networks simultaneously during the COVID-19 pandemic. One is the universal broadband service at 100 Mbps speed introduced in 2020, and the other is the rural broadband project in terms of a public-private partnership (PPP) that proceeded from August 2020 to 2022. While both policies contribute to reducing the broadband gap between the urban and the rural in the country, it is still important to find the optimal cost-effective combination of the plural rural policies as much as possible from the cost perspective. Accordingly, this study proposes an investment cost estimation model for deploying rural broadband via fiber networks in South Korea and evaluates whether implementing two rural broadband policies in the country is cost-effective. The proposed model is designed according to the bottom-up approach, which involves building an efficient network with the latest technologies; thus, it gives a more accurate and reliable estimation of the investment cost of building rural broadband in the South Korean territory. The significant findings of this study are twofold. First, the PPP-based project could make the participating internet service providers (ISPs) deploy broadband at a cost-effective level, similar or lower to the universal service, and then recover the investment cost per building within a reasonable period. Thus, the result implies that governments need to consider the PPP-based project as an effective measure to deploy rural broadband, in addition to the introduction of universal service. Implementing multiple broadband policies to expand rural broadband coverage could be a reasonable and practical approach to improving broadband availability. Second, the governments still needs to make efforts to solve the complicated difficulties in rural areas in South Korea where rural-related broadband policies are still challenging to implement. This study confirmed that in some regions, the PPP-based project was still inferior to universal service in terms of average investment cost. In contrast, universal service had significant constraints to providing broadband because of the end-users cost burden, resulting in low broadband adoption. Therefore, the government needs to consider some measures to increase broadband availability and broadband adoption, such as widening the rural areas under the jurisdiction of participating ISPs, decreasing the proportion of participating ISPs bearing the investment cost of deploying broadband, and improving the cost burden of the end-users of universal service in some limited areas. © 2023 The Authors","Investment cost estimation; Public-private partnerships; Rural broadband; South Korea; Universal service",""

The work presented here shows that this idea is debatable. Data from Spain, a country where daily internet users are 75.9 percent of the population, prove that the gender gap still exists. The paper explores if this gap can be entirely explained by the socioeconomic differences between men and women. We build a micro panel model and incorporate a set of socioeconomic variables (age, education, income, employment status, digital skills, and resident population) that allow us to isolate the effects of gender on the decision to become a daily Internet user. The results conclude that the Internet gap is a phenomenon with a specific gender component. Other things being equal a woman negatively affects the probability of using the Internet. Applying a similar model to 15 Internet services, we obtain that gender is always significant to explain the likelihood of being a user of each service. However, in some services (7 out of 15), the effect is favorable to women, and for other services (8), the gender effect favors men. The work concludes by analyzing the impact of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic on the use of Internet services, paying particular attention to its possible implications for the gender gap. © 2022 The Authors","Covid-19; Digital divide; Gender gap; Internet penetration; Internet services; Panel data",""

The findings indicate that users' intention to use MHSPL is directly influenced by performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and trust. Trust also mediated users' intention to use MHSPL, leading to an indirect effect of social influence and privacy concerns. Additionally, people with different experiences using MHSPL have significant differences in their intention to use MHSPL. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of users' behavior of MHSPL and can help facilitate and improve health services provided by public libraries. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Effort expectancy; Mobile health services; Performance expectancy; Privacy concerns; Public libraries; Trust; Users' intention",""

Countries around the world have devoted unprecedented levels of resources to build up their testing and tracing capabilities, including the development and deployment of smartphone-based applications. Yet despite these nontrivial investments, the body of academic literature evaluating the effects of the smartphone-based applications remains scant and many apps have not delivered the promised benefits (Bano et al. 2021). We contribute to this body of empirical evidence by analysing data on uptake and usage of New Zealand's QR code-based application New Zealand COVID Tracer (NZCT). Our paper uses descriptive statistics and regression analysis to focus on the likelihood of an individual registering to use the application, the likelihood that a registered user will use the application to scan QR codes, and the extent of that usage, measured as the number of codes scanned daily. In addition, we take advantage of the “natural experiment” offered by the decision in August 2021 following the establishment of endemic community transmission of COVID-19 to make use of the application mandatory from 7 September 2021 to assess the effect of this policy on usage. We find that despite increasing numbers of individuals downloading the application over time, the number of active devices and scanning activity was very low, even when community outbreaks occurred (i.e. actual infection risk was higher). Mandating use (separate and distinct from increased infection risk) led to an increase in the number of scans in total via an increase in the number of active devices only. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Community transmission; Contact tracing; COVID-19; health informatics; New Zealand; New Zealand COVID Tracer; Smartphone applications",""

We ask respondents about the likelihood they would use three types of personalized advertising services delivered through their mobile operator, with services varying with respect to the level of personal data collected and whether shared with third parties. In all four countries, respondents state that their likelihood of using a personalized ad service decreases when the service uses more personal data or shares the data with third parties. Using a split sample design, we find that introducing a 10% discount on mobile subscriptions for those using the ad service increases the stated likelihood of using the service. We find significant differences in willingness to share personal data attitudes between countries, with respondents in high-income Norway being least willing and those in low-income Pakistan most willing to share personal data. We identify only minor differences between respondents in Serbia and Malaysia, middle-income countries in Europe and Asia. The study contributes to the literature on the willingness to share personal data by including young adult respondents from countries in both Europe and Asia.

Findings indicate that ICTs positively and significantly affect the participation of developing countries in GVCs. This positive and significant effect of ICTs on countries participation in GVCs can be explained by the fact that ICTs, especially digitalization may help countries improve their competitiveness in the global market as a result of effects on competitive advantages, including price, product and service. Then, the study deeply explores the relationship between ICTs, other control variables and countries' participation in GVCs by employing the Driscoll and Kraay estimator and the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) technique. The results are robust and confirm the results of the Bayesian approach.

We show that the objective of satisfying the Maastricht inflation condition to allow participation in the European Monetary Union from 1999 led some national governments to block the rebalancing of telecommunications tariffs. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the years immediately before the liberalization of the telecommunications market, those countries that faced greater difficulty achieving the inflation objectives of the Maastricht Treaty reduced, rather than increased, the prices of local telephone calls and line rental. Furthermore, these countries did not intensify efforts to rebalance their tariffs after the creation of the euro.

Based on the past experiences in Korea, this paper examines the Korean government's choice of auction rules in the face of conflicting policy goals. This paper also recommends that the government implement the following regulatory reforms and consider the auction related measures to deepen its spectrum market or increase the number of bidders: (i) relaxation of foreign ownership restrictions, (ii) introduction of regional or site-specific spectrum licenses, and (iii) modification of auction formats.

We also show that importing more robots and for extended periods promotes the effects of industrial robots applications on the export product quality upgrades of Chinese enterprises. Mechanism tests reveal that industrial robots applications can upgrade the quality of export products by improving the labor productivity and human capital level of enterprises. Finally, spillover analyses show that industrial robots applications intensity significantly affects export quality upgrades through spillover effects. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","China; Export quality; Industrial robots applications; Labor productivity",""

Significantly, how the digital economy modulates the effects of financial development on trade remains unexplored. Our study addresses these research gaps using panel data from 47 African economies spanning 1990 to 2019. Our findings based on the dynamic system GMM approach show that the direct impacts of financial development and the digital economy have been crucial in driving international trade in Africa in the short and long runs. Second, in the short and long runs, the digital economy serves as a vital channel through which financial development has the most significant impact on trade in Africa. Third, the robustness checks by excluding countries endowed with natural resources in Africa provide robust evidence that digital technology and finance matter for trade. Further, the study discloses an important novelty in that the marginal effects on trade increase when financial development in Africa interacts with the digital economy. In light of these findings, we conclude that policy reforms should focus on policies that encourage the development of the digital economy and its use in the financial sector in Africa. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Africa; Digital economy; Financial development; International trade",""

The analysis confirmed Ruthven's conclusion in the Chinese context that the statements describing conscious information needs are more narrative with more emotional and sensitive words. Females, on the other hand, frequently express their information needs consciously. Problematic situations generate information needs. Consequently, understanding the information needs levels should consider additional contextual aspects, and the initial stages of information needs are essentially the awareness in problematic situations.

The standardization policy system comprising the supply, demand, and environment policy tool types has evolved during standardization development process, which includes three sequential stages: 1) the following-up stage, 2) the catch-up stage, and 3) the upgrading stage. In responding to changes in institutional, economic and technological contexts, the policy orientation has transformed from supporting the government-controlled adoption and standardization of foreign technologies in the following-up stage of standardization development process to developing indigenous standards owning independent intellectual property rights (IPRs) through the government-led standardization system in the catch-up stage, and to international standardization adopting both government-led and market mechanisms in the upgrading stage. In this process, the Chinese Government continued to offer policy support to but tended to relax its control over standardization. Of the three policy tool types, the supply type have remained the dominant ones; the weight of the environment-type of tools tended to decrease, and that of the demand-type of tools tended to increase. Further, the government rationalized the mix of each type of policy tools as the standardization contexts changed. From the Chinese experience, theoretical prescriptions for how standardization policy systems evolve in latecomers are developed. Practical implications for latecomer countries to transform standardization policy system and design their standardization policies are discussed. © 2022 The Authors","China; Policy system; Policy tool; Standard; Standardization",""

We use micro-level data on UBB exposure in 2019 matched with municipality-level information on local GDP and employment levels based on tax declarations for the period 2019–2020. We address the endogeneity between UBB and local income by exploiting the distance from the closest backbone node of the upstream telecommunication network. We find that exposure to UBB mitigates the negative effect of the pandemic on local employment. One additional year of UBB exposure increases local employment by 1.3 percentage points. The effect is stronger in areas hit more severely by the pandemic, thus confirming the role of advanced broadband infrastructures on the economic resilience from negative shocks. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Covid-19; Fiber-based networks; Resilience; Ultra-broadband (UBB)",""

While technological utopians believed that One Laptop Per Child (OLPC)-like programs could reduce societal inequalities, the economics literature evaluating these initiatives has mostly focused on student's human capital. Results suggest no impact, even for successful programs such as Uruguay's own OLPC-inspired Plan Ceibal.

We discuss the potential mechanisms behind these results. Regarding household PC access, even though Plan Ceibal was conceived as a universal program targeting primary-level students attending public schools, both infantilization of poverty and a dual-system educational stratification may explain why this initiative had a heterogenous impact across different income groups. Regarding household connectivity, Plan Ceibal reduced the cost of the bundle required to consume internet services at the time of the study, improving affordability and access among households with beneficiaries of the program. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Digital inequalities; ICT household Access; One laptop per child; Plan ceibal; Technological diffusion",""

We further identify that ICT services are more integrated in the Greek production network compared to ICT manufacturing, but their production linkages are underperforming in terms of meaningful contribution to the activity of the rest of the sectors.

A quantitative study was conducted to examine how contextual factors (i.e., external situations, social relations, individual situations, and social interactions) affected the information poverty of ethnic villages in rural Southwest China. Research results showed that geographic locations, information assets, individual literacy, and individual psychology significantly influenced information poverty. Social norms and beliefs also affected information poverty; however, this influence was insignificant. These findings extend existing studies on information poverty and provide practical guidance for stakeholders (e.g., governments, libraries, and intellectual works) to alleviate information poverty. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Context; Ethnic villages; Information inequity; Information poverty; PLSSEM; Small world",""

The change has been spurred by disruptive efficiencies in digital platforms. First, information distribution has been altered by near-costless electronic reproduction. Second, traditional bundles – packaging editorial content of publications or broadcast networks with general-interest advertising messages – have been eclipsed by competitively superior news aggregation hubs. Third, specialized content, including advertising, has become more easily targeted and better supplied via “long tails.” Fourth, the democratization of “publishing” has transformed “editing” into “platform mediation.” The resulting changes in market organization have made vastly higher volumes of news and public affairs information – from exponentially more sources – easily available to mass market consumers. In so doing, they have rendered the “Walter Cronkite” consensus obsolete, creating social controversy and considerable backlash. Demands to regulate, or re-regulate, are frequently voiced across the political spectrum.

By employing a means-end chain approach through laddering interviews, this study explores the fans’ goal structure in the transcreation of webtoons. The results reveal that transcreation is an expression of enthusiasm toward webtoons and the creators, facilitating socialization and establishing a sense of belonging in the transcreation community. Fans improve their language skills with the aim of obtaining career-related benefits and enhance their expertise to achieve personal growth.

Furthermore, mobile phones increase the availability of village libraries and access to credit for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Using the plausibly exogenous variation of lightning strike intensity as the instrumental variable, this study suggests that higher mobile phone signal strength is positively associated with the policies implemented by the village head and leads to better social development.

In particular, our analysis finds that imperfect financing and demand risk allocations in projects can jeopardize their operational and financial sustainability. As well, the examination of these experiences allows us to conclude that in markets characterized by continuous economic and technological transformations, vertical separation restrictions imposed for reducing the risk of increasing market power and concentration may not be justified.

Given this context, we analyze the impact of data policies that impose restrictions on digital trade, specifically on cross border data flows. We construct Market Data Restrictions Index (MDRI), that measures the data restrictions faced by an exporting country from their trade partners. We use a variation of random effect model on a panel data set consisting of 60 countries that contribute to more than 50 percent of IT services export during the period 2006–2017. The results indicate that apart from variables such as Foreign Direct Investment, and Service Value Added, the MDRI of partner countries has a moderate negative effect on IT services export. If countries move from liberal policies to stringent data restrictions, the economies of the country that exports its ICT services to these partner countries is affected substantially. Hence government regulators shall be cautious in imposing stringent data restrictions as it affects global digital trade. © 2022","Correlated random effects; Data localization; Foreign direct investment; Network readiness index; Service value added",""

A shortage of spectrum (or the inefficient assignment of it) is blamed, among other things, for South Africa's relatively slow LTE 4G speeds. Through historical accident, the country has two mobile data networks in addition to the four licensed mobile operators. The response of operators has been to innovate using roaming and network sharing agreements; as we explore in this paper, these have become the de facto spectrum allocation process. This paper looks at how the de facto industry structure has been moulded by spectrum holdings and sharing arrangements and asks how spectrum management could be improved. We observe that, although the number of mobile operators has effectively been reduced to 3 (a number which would raise concern in some circles), there exist a variety of arrangements between those three and other spectrum and network operators. The smallest of the current three mobile operators is still not able to offer a nationwide mobile service without a roaming agreement but, at the same time, the two larger operators depend critically on spectrum and roaming agreements themselves, mainly with the two physical data network operators that function as wholesale providers. The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) was established as a consequence of a new constitution that was adopted in 1996 and it helped to create new institutional arrangements for the burgeoning mobile industry. The authority has nevertheless continued to be hampered, as we shall demonstrate, by political imperatives. This has been pointed out by other authors over the past twenty years and we add to this body of evidence by considering the spectrum auction planned (again) for 2021. The “2021” auction is in fact an iteration of the auction originally announced in May 2010 and then abandoned (Song, 2011). The same thing happened again in 2016 (Paelo & Robb, 2020). Late in 2020, the regulator again announced an auction, due to take place during 2021 but by the second quarter of the year, two of the four national operators had already obtained a court injunction to stop it. The process is intertwined with a political imperative to establish a public wireless open-access network, which we discuss in detail. We describe how the industry has navigated around policy and regulatory dysfunction and how competitive interaction among the South African operators has managed to prevail. Following Hausman & Taylor's (2013) lead in their work on the United States, in this paper we provide a commentary on apparently perverse outcomes from significant regulatory, judicial and legislative actions (or, perhaps more accurately, inactions) governing the South African mobile telecommunications industry from the commencement of the current constitutional arrangements in 1996 to the present. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","ICASA; Mobile industry structure; network sharing; South Africa; Spectrum auction",""

Paid peering is a relationship where two networks exchange traffic with payment, which provides direct access to each other's customers without having to pay a third party to carry that traffic for them. The issue will arise again when the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) considers a new net neutrality order. We first consider the effect of paid peering on broadband prices. We adopt a two-sided market model in which an ISP maximizes profit by setting broadband prices and a paid peering price. We analytically derive the profit-maximizing prices, and show that they satisfy a generalization of the well-known Lerner rule. Our result shows that paid peering fees reduce the premium plan price, increase the video streaming price and the total price for premium tier customers who subscribe to video streaming services; however, the ISP passes on to its customers only a portion of the revenue from paid peering. ISP profit increases but video streaming profit decreases as an ISP moves from settlement-free peering to paid peering price. We next consider the effect of paid peering on consumer surplus. We find that consumer surplus is a uni-modal function of the paid peering fee. The paid peering fee that maximizes consumer surplus depends on elasticities of demand for broadband and for video streaming. However, consumer surplus is maximized when paid peering fees are significantly lower than those that maximize ISP profit. However, it does not follow that settlement-free peering is always the policy that maximizes consumer surplus. The peering price depends critically on the incremental ISP cost per video streaming subscriber; at different costs, it can be negative, zero, or positive. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Broadband; Interconnection; Net neutrality; Paid peering; Regulation; Two-sided model",""

As space-faring actors (who are increasingly from the private sector, in addition to government-affiliated) become more involved with these activities, fragmentation from a variety of sources (colloquially grouped as space debris) will only continue to proliferate before outright impeding the ability of humans to conduct operations in space altogether.

This solution takes place in the form of collaborative/flexible endeavors between the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), International Telecommunication Union (ITU), private sector spaceflight corporations, and governmental space agencies to mitigate space debris pileup. Through the usage of new technologies to spearhead space debris cleanup, non-partisan economic incentives, and clarification on acceptable environmental conditions for satellite launches, an adaptive governance model for handling space debris is key to making space safe for communication and research. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive governance; Debris mitigation; ITU; Space debris; Space policy; UNOOSA",""

Thus, this study examines the impact of the government's 5G policy announcements on telecommunication operators' firm value in China, where the state exerts a strong influence on industry development. We find that government policy announcement in general affects telecommunication operators' stock returns negatively, and when the government announces policies with a higher level of interference, the decline in firm value is more pronounced. To understand the comprehensive impact of 5G technology on telecommunication operators, we also examine the effect of institution-driven corporate technology R&D and investment activities on firm value. We find that the firms' 5G activities also decrease their firm value, and this effect is more significant than government policy announcements.

The study considers 41 countries in the region which are geographically linked, and it allows for spatial interdependence. It also accounts for differences in demographic characteristics as well as social, political and economic infrastructure which affect ICT access and use. Globally, about half of the world's population is connected to the internet whereas the remaining half, i.e. about 3.8 billion people, are not (yet) connected. The problem is more severe in developing countries compared to developed countries; it is said to be unsatisfactory in SSA compared to other countries. We apply a spatial panel analysis using the spatial Durbin model (SDM) specifications for 451 observations from 2006 to 2016. Our estimation results show that there is a strong spatial interdependence among SSA, implying that internet access and broadband subscriptions in one country are affected by internet access and broadband subscriptions in another country, most likely due to spillover effects. Our results reveal that GDP per capita, gross capital formation, political stability, regulatory efficacy and electricity infrastructure directly affect the digital divide. Moreover, GDP per capita, population growth, government consumption, trade openness, and electricity infrastructure also indirectly affect the digital divide through spillover effects. Regarding policy implications we suggest that SSA governments should work closer together in ensuring internet openness and to increase the level of coordination between their countries in order to ensure digital inclusion in their countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Digital divide; Spatial analysis; Spatial Durbin model; Sub-Saharan Africa",""

Finally, we conduct an econometric analysis to determine the extent to which regulatory measures, privatization, market structure and the population dimension determine market shares. Overall, we can argue that, although concentration remains high, the market has become more competitive since the liberalization process began. The statistical analysis and the econometric assessment show that the entrance of the third operator made the market more competitive. Indeed, there is evidence that operator companies competed to capture customers from each other during the period under study.

Because the future development of 5G technology and markets is open-ended, policy has to be developed with incomplete knowledge and under conditions of uncertainty. These circumstances call for adaptive forms of policy and a focus on the creation of guardrails for market players, backed up by regulatory powers to intervene more directly if necessary.

Examples include sleep trackers, fitness trackers, continuous glucose monitors, and RFID-enabled implants, with many additional biometric or health surveillance applications in development or envisioned. These data are included in growing stockpiles of personal health data (PHI) being mined for insight by health economists, policy analysts, researchers, and health system organizations. Dominant narratives position these highly personal data as valuable resources to transform healthcare, stimulate innovation in medical research, and engage individuals in their health and healthcare. Large tech companies are also increasingly implicated in these areas, through mobile health application sales and data acquisitions. Given the many possible uses and users for PGHD, ensuring privacy, security, and equity of benefits from PGHD will be challenging. This is due in part to disparate regulatory policies and practices across technology firms, health system organizations, and health researchers. Rapid developments with PGHD technologies and the lack of harmonization between regulatory regimes may render existing safeguards to preserve patient privacy and control over their PGHD ineffective, while also failing to guide PGHD-related innovation in socially desirable directions. Using a policy regime lens to explore these challenges, we examine three existing data protection regimes relevant to PGHD in the United States that are currently in tension with one another: federal and state health-sector laws, regulations on data use and reuse for research and innovation, and industry self-regulation of consumer privacy by large tech companies. We argue that harmonization of these regimes is necessary to meet the challenges of PGHD data governance. We next examine emerging governing instruments, identifying three types of structures (organizational, regulatory, technological/algorithmic), which synergistically could help enact needed regulatory oversight while limiting the friction and economic costs of regulation that may hinder innovation.

People previously excluded from the financial system have started to have access to financial services such as receiving and sending remittances, saving, and borrowing. This study examines the effect of network accessibility on the use of mobile money in six developing countries (Bangladesh, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Uganda) using GPS information on each household and mobile phone network coverage maps. We find that among these six countries, network accessibility is associated with the use of mobile money in a robust way only in Pakistan and Tanzania. In those two countries, when a household location becomes 10 km closer to the center of the area with multiple mobile networks, the probability of using mobile money increases by 10 percent. In the other countries, we did not find a robust relationship between the use of mobile money and network accessibility. This suggests that increasing network accessibility may not be an efficient method for increasing mobile money adoption in certain countries. The fact that mobile money use rates differ between Tanzania and Pakistan also suggests that the effect of mobile networks is unrelated to the overall level of mobile money adoption. © 2022","Developing countries; Financial inclusion; GPS; Mobile money; Mobile network; Network coverage",""

This divide is the result of multiple market failures in both the demand and supply of broadband access, which have been addressed through public, private and community-led initiatives. Based on interviews and ethnographic analysis, this paper explores how community networks and public-private partnerships have contributed to promoting the delivery and adoption of superfast broadband across the rural UK. The case study analysis compares the outcomes of each model, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Although expanding the coverage of superfast broadband across the county, the public-private partnership did not solve the access divide afflicting the hardest-to-reach areas. Some of the latter were served by the community network, which relied on volunteers and demand aggregation to reduce the cost of fibre rollout. The scalability of this approach, however, has yet to be demonstrated. On the demand side, both initiatives achieved a high take-up proving that the rural ‘adoption’ divide has decreased over the years. Nevertheless, more needs to be done to ensure that rural communities and businesses are able to leverage the benefits deriving from superfast broadband. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Broadband policy; Community networks; Digital divides; Public private partnerships; Rural broadband; UK",""

At the same time, ICT patents have a unidirectional causal impact on both, overall economic growth, and the growth of services and manufacturing. Second, the impact of total patents on economic growth is stronger in advanced economies.

Moreover, news posted on social media usually includes images, but little is known about the role of such images in shaping user decisions to share negative news. To fill this gap, the humans' affective–cognitive model of information processing (HACIP) was developed to explore the effects of images on the sharing of negative news and to investigate the contingent role of images in the sharing decision. To test the model and hypotheses, a scenario-based online experiment was conducted, which yielded 285 valid responses. Analysis results indicate that images in negative news induce users' negative emotion and arousal, which influence their sharing decision. Further, the presence of images strengthens the effect of negative emotion and weakens the effect of information uniqueness.

Similarly, 87% have not actually generated sufficient nominal cash flow to put them on track to achieve long-run solvency. In addition, 73% generated negative nominal cash flow over the past three fiscal years, leaving them poorly positioned to make up their deficits and causing them to fall farther into debt. An assessment based on the net present value of these projects' operating cash flow indicates that 53% of projects would not be on track to breakeven even assuming the theoretical best-case performance in terms of capital expenditures and debt service.

We decompose SMEs' access to finance into two components, i.e., basic and advanced access to finance. Basic access to finance is captured from two indicators; namely, the firm's bank account and line of credit from a financial institution, while advanced access is captured by whether the firm's investments and working capital is financed by the bank. Consistent with the information asymmetry hypothesis, our findings confirm that ICT adoption reduces information asymmetry between SMEs and banks. Therefore, banks are more likely to grant credit and to finance projects and the working capital needs of innovative SMEs. Moreover, this study complements the argument of resource-based theory (RBT) and suggests that innovation can provide a competitive advantage with regard to a firm's access to credit. These results imply that SMEs with greater access to and use of new technologies are more likely to acquire financial resources from banks. The results hold to various robustness checks and identification strategies.

Typically, mobile phones are designed with a view towards obsolescence for users in industrially developed countries, as the expected repair in these circumstances is minimal. In contrast, in developing countries, such as India, these phones are constantly repaired and are owned several times by different people before their final demise. Therefore, to support repairability, a field study based in Mumbai, India, was conducted to understand the cognitive basis of repair. The results were further analyzed using a cognitive work analysis framework that provides insight into the possibilities for informational requirements for design. The findings indicate that small-scale repair shops (3–4 repairmen) and the hole-in-the-wall shops (1 repairman) can benefit from the intervention in terms of informational support for the repair activity. If the cognitive dimension of repair is supported for these low-cost repair shops, we can expect an increase in the capability and efficacy of the repairmen, resulting in fewer phones ending up as e-waste. Thus, due to its low cost, informational diagrams that support the repair activity can be incorporated by the manufacturer without any radical changes in existing proprietary technology, resulting in the possibility for the long-term growth of the repair ecology in a country such as India. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Cognitive work analysis; Design for repairability; Ethnography; Mobile phone; Repair",""

At the same time, there is some tentative evidence suggesting that information and communication technology is positively correlated with income inequality. However, whether and how ICT affects wealth inequality is less explored, particularly because of the lack of reliable data on wealth inequality. This paper, therefore, fills this gap and contributes to this new literature by investigating the effect of ICT on wealth inequality in a sample of 45 developed and developing countries over the period 2000–2017. ICT is measured with six different indicators (including internet penetration, mobile penetration, ICT service exports, the ICT index, ICT quality, and ICT quantity), while wealth inequality is measured with three different indicators (comprising billionaire wealth to GDP, the Top 1% wealth share, and the Top 10% wealth share). The empirical analysis is based on the Generalised Method of Moments, and the results show that ICT increases wealth inequality. Furthermore, we show that democracy mitigates the increasing effect of ICT on wealth inequality. This result suggests that improving democracy in both developed and developing countries is an effective mechanism for mitigating the effects of ICT on wealth inequality. Therefore, we encourage efforts to implement democratic institutions that ensure respect for citizens' freedoms, greater democratic accountability, and executive constraints that allow for a more egalitarian distribution of wealth. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","ICT; Panel data; Wealth inequality",""

Further, interactional and communicational use of social media makes epistemological beliefs more sophisticated. However, it is more likely to have naïve beliefs with the use of social media for making new friends. Also, the purposes of social media use and epistemological beliefs affect NML skills.

Moreover, spectrum auctions have become a common method for spectrum allocation by telecom regulators in recent decades. In Thailand, the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) over the past years has used a spectrum cap setting mechanism to encourage more competition in both the auctions and in the market after the auctions. This mechanism also allows regulators to determine the number of mobile operators in the market. However, regulatory mandated spectrum caps can potentially harm a large mobile operator's performance since spectrum caps can preclude large carriers from getting more necessary spectrum to support their customers' demand. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to demonstrate the effect of spectrum caps' determination using frequency allocation in Thailand as a case study. This paper employs data from Q3 2012 - Q1 2020 for the three major mobile operators in Thailand (AIS, TRUE, and DTAC) and analyzes the mean difference of six operating parameters by 1 MHz spectrum and the industry average. Results revealed that AIS was the largest carrier with the most spectrum amount, the greatest number of users, with revenue exceeding the industry average. AIS also had a statistically significant operational efficiency in all six of the evaluated dimensions. However, TRUE which is second in the total number of users in Thailand was determined to have no statistically significant operating efficiencies. Furthermore, the study determined that operators need additional spectrum so that they can increase market share through improved service quality. Finally, the empirical evidence suggests that spectrum caps when set in conjunction with each auction did not create any significant operator's efficiency problem. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Mobile auction; Mobile spectrum; Spectrum caps; Thailand",""

One of these challenges is the growing quantity of food demand, which is highly vital for regional trade, food security, and meeting the nutritious requirements of the population. A timely prediction with accuracy about crop yield could be valuable for greater food production and maintainability of sustainable agricultural growth. This paper presents a predictive model of wheat production using machine learning. The northern areas of Pakistan which grow wheat are selected as a case study due to their importance in the country's agricultural sector. We collected data of five years and selected the best attribute subset related to crop production. We applied twelve (12) algorithms by dividing data samples into three sets. Experimental results helped to shortlist three algorithms for the final analysis i.e. Sequential Minimal Optimization Regression (SMOreg), Multilayer Processing (MLP) and Gaussian Process (GP). The Root Mean Square (RMSE) and Percentage Absolute Difference (PAD) metrics were used to validate the results. The SMOreg obtained the lowest PAD (0.0093) and RMSE (0.5552) values. MLP was a little closer with second-lowest PAD (0.0116) and RMSE (0.737) value. The performance of GP was found lowest due to higher PAD (0.2203) and RMSE (17.7423) values.

The typical paths “source sector → (intermediate sector) → ICT final demand” generate many routine/non-routine jobs, which are primarily lied in the zero and first rounds. The decomposition results show that the declining sectoral routine/non-routine job coefficients drives the decline of both ICT embodied routine and non-routine jobs (especially the former), which is completely offset by the rising final demand of ICT.

We assess whether policies to assign spectrum had an impact on consumer welfare in 64 countries during the 2010–2017 period. We find evidence that policies that reduce the amount of spectrum available to operators, delay the assignment of spectrum and increase the cost of spectrum all impacted two important consumer outcomes - network coverage and quality.

Mobile phone ownership (MPO) can play a key role in bridging this digital divide and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals of “End poverty in all its forms everywhere”, “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls”, and “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”. Administrative district-level infrastructural and societal readiness to women's MPO in rural settings of Bangladesh may also influence the geospatial variation in their MPO status, which is still unexplained. In the context of rural Bangladesh, household heads substantially exert influence over women's decision-making process. However, the role of household heads' age and education on women's MPO is mostly unexplored. As in developing countries, women's MPO does not ensure its usage, investigating the possibilities of women's MPO on its usage has immense importance. Therefore, this study aims to revisit the correlates of rural women's MPO in Bangladesh and explain the administrative district-level geospatial variation in their MPO by controlling the effect of individual and household-level sociodemographic correlates of MPO. Further, this study attempts to investigate the possibilities of MPO on the extent of its usage. This study used the latest nationally representative cross-sectional data from Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2019. This study reveals that the district-level readiness was a potential source of geospatial variation in the prevalence of rural women's MPO in Bangladesh. The lowest level of readiness was noticed in north-western Bangladesh. Comparatively elderly women with better education and media exposure had a considerably higher chance of MPO. Elderly household heads, especially male and less educated heads, hindered the MPO of women. This study identified MPO as a key determinant of its extent of usage. Moreover, to increase the MPO by a faster pace, strategies should target less empowered women, particularly those who lived in districts of lower readiness. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Determinants; Digital divide; Empowerment; Geospatial heterogeneity; Mobile phone; Rural Bangladesh",""

They offer one-stop-shop licensing efficiencies, reduce transaction costs, and increase the predictability of the licensing environment for the benefit of innovation diffusion. However, pools failed to take off for previous cellular standards. This article analyses both retrospectively the reasons for such failures and prospectively what makes the 5G environment more conductive to pool formation and licensing. Avanci, a patent pool for licensing cellular standards in the Internet of Things (IoT), is a significant development but has limited licensing coverage so far. The article then recommends five policy principles to facilitate pool licensing in the IoT. They include recognising that only enough upstream SEP owners need to join the 5G pool to create a market signalling effect. Some vertically integrated SEP owners may remain outsiders, and some bilateral licensing may co-exist without damaging the pool's success. To encourage upstream SEP owners to join the pool, they should be allowed to set ‘high enough’ royalty rates and divide pools' royalties among members under value proportionality rules. 5G pools must also be flexible and adopt different licensing programs that consider the specificities of each IoT market. Finally, pool administrators should consult with IoT implementers before establishing licensing programs for them and have infringement legal standing if everything else fails. These principles would go a long way in spurring the broader use of 5G pool licensing for a more efficient, straightforward, and predictable IoT licensing environment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","FRAND; Innovation; IoT; NPEs; SEPs",""

However, when the contract for the procurement of the NBP was eventually signed in 2019 the estimated subsidy had risen to between €2.2 and €2.9 billion. Using a path dependency framework, this paper finds that the escalation in the cost of subsidy was driven by two main factors. First, the decision to roll out fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) technology was inconsistent with the geographic/legacy path dependencies related to Ireland's low-density rural population. Second, the gap-funding/PPP procurement model adopted for the intervention failed to attract competitive bids and was at odds with the competitive path dependency and the dominant role of the incumbent operator. © 2021 The Authors","Fibre to the premises; Gap funding; Ireland; National broadband plan; Path dependency; Public private partnership; State aid",""

This situation has somehow been changing with, inter alia, the advancement and application of modern Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). In recent years, China has been pushing for the inclusion of its rural communities into modern information society through aggressively digitalizing its rural areas under a public policy umbrella. With the literature's lopsided focus on Western nations, a cohesive paradigm in mapping the Chinese style of universal service implementation remains elusive, a situation that has often obfuscated deeper understanding of the Chinese case from a socioeconomic, technological, or institutional perspective. The main purpose of this present paper lies in the framing and modelling of China's universal service and rural digitalization practices. The paper proposes and applies an integrated offer–agent–target (OAT) framework in a retrospective and empirical examination of the Chinese case and conceptual characterization of what has appeared to be the Chinese model. In so doing, China's universal service development is demarcated into discernible stages that are then pattern-matched with corresponding institutional landscapes. Three salient stages are identified and corresponding institutional landscapes explicated. Finally, insights and suggestions are offered that throws lights on the current issues and future developments. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Broadband Internet; Chinese model; Digital economy; Digital transformation; Information and communication technologies (ICT); Mobile Internet; USO policy framework",""

The proposed method relies on a partial equilibrium simulation approach and estimates the welfare impacts on current consumers and the potential welfare effects among new consumers brought into the market by changes in prices due to competition. This approach is applied to the information and communication technology (ICT) sector in Ethiopia, one of the three countries in the world with a monopoly in the market for mobile phone services. Based on household budget survey data for 2015/16 and departing from a baseline reform scenario that dilutes the market share of the state-owned monopoly to 45 percent, the simulation model estimates a 25.3 percent reduction in the price of mobile services and an increase in 5.7 million new users of mobile services. The predicted drop in prices and increased users would generate a combined relative welfare gain of 1.18 percent (1.09 percent among current users and 0.09 percent among new users), that could be translated into a 0.31 percentage point decline in the national poverty rate and equivalent to lifting about 275,000 people out of poverty. Alternative reform scenarios that dilute the market share of the monopoly to 75 percent and to 30 percent are expected to reduce poverty rate in 0.13 and 0.52 percentage points, respectively. The method proposed in this study represents a useful tool for promoting competition reforms in developing countries, particularly in sectors known for excluding significant segments of the population because of high consumer prices. © 2021","Competition reform; Ethiopia; ICT; Simulations; Welfare effects",""

In response, policy approaches worldwide are being reconsidered and new approaches developed that are more appropriate to these conditions. This article explores the conditions under which policies that worked in the past remain appropriate and when they will likely fail. It explores the role of dynamic analytical frames and a reconsideration of the normative principles of information society policies in overcoming these weaknesses. New instruments and policy arrangements that are considered include the establishment of boundary conditions (“guardrails”) for players, reliance on adaptive forms of policy, and reliance on ethics across all layers of governance. Driven by the global heterogeneity of values and the diversity of historical, economic, political, and cultural conditions, national and global governance arrangements will likely become more multi-centric. To avoid regulatory drift and fragmentation, policy must strive to create dynamic learning systems that help to continuously improve information society governance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive regulation; Deep uncertainty; Ethics; Governance; Information society; Interdependence; Normative foundations",""

In particular, the fast-changing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has directly led to a far-reaching impact on the production and operation of firms. Many previous studies have discussed the relationship of ICT and the total factor productivity (TFP) of firms, but failed to reach a consistent conclusion. This paper, based on the data of Chinese listed manufacturing firms from 2010 to 2019, explores the impact of ICT on manufacturing firms' TFP and its mechanism, and concludes that ICT have positive correlation with the TFP of manufacturing firms. According to the estimated results of this paper, TFP will increase by about 1.8 % for every 1 % of additional ICT investment. Through channel analysis, this paper finds that the positive effect can be achieved through the following four channels: cutting information search costs, enhancing information processing capabilities, reducing internal capital misallocation, and promoting R&D efficiency. This paper is a supplement to research on firm TFP, provides new micro-evidence for exploring the relationship between ICT and TFP of manufacturing firms, and brings important implications for understanding the role of ICT in firm production activities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Capital misallocation; ICT productivity Paradox; Search costs; TFP of manufacturing firms",""

The analysis revealed that most participants didn't consider favorably emergency communications polices at the federal level. Similarly, most considered state level policies as not adequate. The policy analysis points to ineffective federal and state emergency communications policies due to the impact of external factors and the lack of coordination of the state government electrical power provider and private telecommunications companies.

I identify this non-prescriptive view of technology as a barrier to addressing human rights through direct civil society engagement in standardization organizations. This view explains why standards rarely reflect human rights concerns as a contextually embedded and social issue more than a technological or communicative problem.

Two important barriers that restrict connectivity are the lack of infrastructure and affordability. To address these barriers, several novel concepts that involve spaceborne and airborne platforms have been proposed to provide connectivity at a lower cost (improve affordability) to a wider reach of people (extend infrastructure). We develop a techno-economic methodology to assess the potential impact of space and aerial concepts in expanding connectivity to uncovered and under-served regions. In particular, constellations of geostationary orbit (GEO) satellites, large constellations of medium Earth orbit (MEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, and high- and low-altitude aerial platforms are studied. Results show that under the current scenario, the impact of space and aerial systems in terms of expanding connectivity would be rather modest; the current cost of satellite technology (~$200 per Mbps/month) are affordable for less than 1% of the uncovered and under-served population in the countries of interest. In a future scenario in 8–10 years, space systems have the highest potential to bring uncovered and under-served populations online, being a viable technology for 24% of the population in these countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Communication satellites; Digital divide; Global connectivity; Internet; Space architecture",""

The starting point of modeling an efficient operator investing in NGA networks is the network modeling approach. In this paper, we compare the most widely adopted network modeling approaches in terms of wholesale fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) prices. In particular, the modified scorched node approach is compared to the extreme cases of the scorched node and the scorched earth approaches. The comparison between the aforementioned scenarios sheds light on the impact of each approach on the wholesale FTTH prices. The main finding of this paper is that the scorched earth approach leads to a maximum of 10% reduction in the short-term access prices compared to the most inefficient scorched node approach, whereas further extending its optimizations by optimizing the number of central offices, both the short-term and long-term wholesale price reductions are quite significant (more than 20%) regardless of service speeds. Consequently, NRAs should consider a geographically differentiated modeling approach when regulating the wholesale market by adjusting the level of scorching in each area and network segment according to the investment plans of telecom operators. An appropriate variation of the modeled network operator's efficiency is expected to more accurately represent the costs of a reasonably efficient operator based on the real market conditions and a forward-looking perspective.

Therefore, the introduction of universal broadband service at 100 Mbps in Korea in 2020 could be a meaningful case study to evaluate the necessity of broadband USO. This study proposes an estimation model of the costs of providing universal broadband service in Korea and assesses whether the introduction of the broadband USO was appropriate in Korea. Since the proposed model was based on the bottom-up (BU) approach, which establishes an efficient network using the latest technologies, the estimated cost of providing universal broadband service nationwide in Korea is accurate and reliable. The main findings are threefold. First, the total cost of providing broadband USO at 100 Mbps through the fiber-to-the-home technology was about 1.1 trillion Korean Won. Since this is a relatively small amount compared with previous evaluations, it could be recovered within a reasonable period from the monthly broadband fee that subscribers pay. Therefore, the result supports the introduction of universal broadband service in Korea. Second, there was no significant difference in the average cost per building for broadband USO between 50 Mbps and 100 Mbps; thus, the Korean government's decision to set the broadband speed for broadband USO at 100 Mbps was reasonable, at least from a cost perspective. These results imply that developed countries with relatively high broadband penetration, in particular, could consider providing universal broadband services of at least 50 Mbps by fiber-based technologies. Lastly, although the total cost of offering fiber-based universal broadband services in Korea was acceptable, the government could also consider including wireless access technology as a technological alternative to reduce the costs of the USO policy. © 2021 The Authors","Broadband; Broadband speeds; Cost estimation; Korea; Universal service",""

The second section describes the three forms of legitimacy that, according to this framework, are necessary for democratic legitimation: input, throughput and output legitimacy. The third section demonstrates our framework's utility by applying it to four paradigmatic proposals/regimes: Facebook's Oversight Board (self-governance regimes); adjudication-focused proposals such as the Manila Principles for Intermediary Liability (rule-of-law-focused regimes); the human-rights-focused framework proposed by then-UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression; and the United Kingdom's Online Harms White Paper (domestic regime). Section four describes our four main findings regarding the case studies: non-state proposals seem to focus on throughput legitimacy; input legitimacy requirements are frequently under examined; state regulation is usually side-lined as a policy option; and output legitimacy is a limited standard to be adopted in supranational contexts. We conclude that only by considering legitimacy as a multifaceted phenomenon based in democratic accountability will it be possible to design platform-governance models that will not only stand the test of time, but will also be accepted by the people whose lives they affect. © 2021 The Authors","Democratic legitimacy; Global governance; Human rights; Input legitimacy; Platform governance",""

While the liberalization policy has increased competition in the sector and reduced significantly telecommunication services prices charged to costumers, statistics on the access and use of telecommunication services in Togo reveal disparities with respect to individuals' socio-economic characteristics which could be an indication of the existence of inequalities of opportunities in the access and use of these services. This paper investigates the inequalities of opportunity in the access and use of telecommunication services in Togo using a parametric approach. The results of estimations indicate that, inequalities of opportunities are larger for men and the elderly than respectively women and youths and are more pronounced in urban areas and regions such as the Plateaux and Savanna regions. Moreover, the circumstance variables such as the ‘place of residence’ and the ‘region’ are the key variables in explaining the inequalities of opportunities in the access and use of telecommunication services in Togo. So, policies toward reducing inequalities of opportunity in the access and use of telecommunication services in Togo should be designed with regards to men, the elderly, and people living in urban areas and regions such as the Plateaux and Savanna regions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Inequalities of opportunity; Parametric approach; Telecommunication services; Telecommunications sector liberalization; Togo",""

The winning bid price in such SMRA spectrum auctions is of interest as it determines the valuation of the scarce resource by the mobile operators, and also indicates the revenue accrued to the governments as auction proceeds. We examine, using a cross-country panel dataset, the determinants of spectrum prices, of all the SMRA auctions held in about 25 countries during 1994–2019. Our findings indicate that reserve prices fixed by the auctioneer as the starting price of auctions and the competition in the auction are the two variables that significantly affect the winning bid prices positively in SMRA auctions. The effect of reserve prices is more pronounced in regional auctions held in countries such as the U.S. and India. Further, the larger the amount of spectrum put on auction, lesser is the winning bid price, thereby indicating the traditional supply-demand relationship. Based on these findings, we provide policy prescriptions on fixing appropriate reserve prices, providing a clear visibility of spectrum availability, and increasing competition in mobile services for effective use of scarce radio spectrum. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Auctions; Mechanism design; Radio waves; Reserve price; Spectrum license; Spectrum price",""

Building upon the theoretical model proposed by Basu et al.

We propose several measures of externalities, distinguishing between foreign and domestic spillovers, and inter- and intra-industry spillovers. We focus on domestic spillovers, and compare a standard measure with a measure computed by weighting the ICT capital of other industries with bilateral sectoral trade. We find that results are affected by the way spillovers are measured. Evidence in favour of domestic externalities is only found when using the second measure, meaning that spillover effects only exist among industries that are connected via international trade.

Traditional Pay TV service providers such as internet protocol television (IPTV) operators and cable TV providers are making efforts to cope with such changes. One of the ways for such providers to remain competitive is to use the proper service models of VODs and the download-to-own (DTO) model can be a very attractive service model for IPTV operators. While many previous studies have examined VOD success, there is a lack of research on the factors that influence VOD success for the DTO model. Thus, this study examined the characteristics of movie VODs as the determinants of DTO performance in the Korean VOD market by analyzing 433 movies offered in 2017 and 2018 via SK Broadband VOD platforms, a major IPTV operator in Korea. The results indicate that G-rated movies, sequel movies, movies with fandom, and those with popular original soundtrack (OST) are likely to have higher sales via a DTO model than other movies.

Notably, the ever increasing bandwidth, together with reduced latency in mobile networks, enables a multitude of new use cases for a wide range of industries. These new use cases have typically increased quality requirements for the wireless connection. Accordingly, the Internet architecture needs to keep pace with the recent developments, particularly in light of the holistic approach of the new fifth generation (5G) mobile communication standard. In this study, we shed light on the effects of 5G on the Internet's core, i.e., on the Internet interdomain traffic. The interdomain traffic between distinct autonomous systems (ASs) is exchanged by transit networks as well as through peerings at private network interconnects (PNIs) and public Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). 5G interdomain traffic estimation is especially important for IXPs as these are focal points that aggregate high traffic volumes. We coherently derive twelve 5G use case groups and present an overview of their individual associated 5G use cases. We characterize the communication networking (connection) requirements and the resulting implications of these use cases. Further, we develop and apply a methodology to assess the 5G use cases, so as to rank them in terms of their projected impact on the overall internet traffic growth. Based on this systematic approach, we conclude that the traffic for the use case groups Video in 5G, Health, and Virtual & Augmented Reality will have the largest impact. We identify a large number of other use case groups, e.g., Live Events, Tactile Internet, and Manufacturing, that will contribute rather small individual fractions to the overall growth of Internet traffic. However, their aggregated contribution to the internet traffic growth will be significant. Our traffic estimation can inform interdomain infrastructure providers, such as IXPs, and policy makers about the likely impact of the introduction of 5G on the interdomain traffic in the Internet. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","5G wireless use cases; Inter-domain traffic; Internet Exchange Point (IXP); Internet traffic growth; Traffic projection model",""

The results revealed that ICT investment and GDP growth affected bi-directionally except for the short-run case in which only ICT investment affected GDP growth. The results explain that ICT investment plays an important role in the economic growth of South Korea in the long term; at the same time, investment size in the ICT industry increases as the economy grows. Without controlling any other factors, we found GDP increases by 0.4% when ICT investment increases by 1%. However, in the short term, only ICT leads to GDP growth. Therefore, the recent stagnation in ICT investment experienced in South Korea could negatively affect the economic growth of Korea in the short run, and hence, in the long-run, if it should become prolonged. The ICT investment strategy revealed from this study is especially useful to policy-makers who plan the economic growth in South Korea and other ICT-advanced countries because promoting ICT utilization across all sectors requires putting legal and policy mechanisms in place. © 2021","Causality; Economic growth; GDP; ICT investment; Vector error correction model",""

This implies that being a large operator itself causes the operator to be a net terminator of traffic and to be a net receiver of call termination payments. For convenience, we will describe this notion as the “regulators' proposition.” This notion could have been a motivation for regulators: to establish asymmetric mobile call termination rates (MTRs) (higher termination rates for smaller operators); or to reduce symmetrical MTRs. We begin with a simple mathematical description of calling between networks that indicates that size does not affect O/T. We also use a unique panel data set from eight mobile operators in Colombia that includes a measure of operator size, a off-net price variable, and two proxies for the proportion of low-income subscribers (one for originating minutes and one for terminating minutes). We do not find empirical support for the regulators' proposition. Operator size is statistically insignificant (and has the incorrect sign – to support the regulator's proposition - in some specifications to). Off-net price and income (rather than network size) variables are significant in explaining O/T. The off-net price variable has the expected negative sign and is significant at the 5% level or better. The income variables have the expected signs and are generally significant at the 5% level. Belief in the regulators' proposition could also, unwittingly, accentuate the urban-rural divide and reduce service to low-income customers, particularly in less-developed countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Call origination and termination; Mobile call termination rate (MTR); Mobile telecommunications; Panel data estimation; Pre-paid mobile; Regulation",""

Primary data were collected through a nationwide survey in 2019 covering all 34 Indonesian provinces. Secondary data regarding Indonesian villages' potential (PODES) are utilized to provide information about the availability of infrastructure at the village level. The standard utility/net gain maximization framework is adopted, and a binary logistic regression model is employed. A total of 8854 useable samples are analyzed. The results suggest that the probability of using e-commerce to make online purchases increases if an individual is male, young, married, highly educated, and an entrepreneur, as well as has access to the Internet, can easily find logistic and financial services, has sufficient digital skills, and has not been exposed to harmful content. These results produce several findings: the relative advantages of e-commerce over traditional commerce and the compatibility of e-commerce with individuals' needs and values can drive its adoption; digital skills and the ubiquitous related infrastructures are an essential requirements to expand e-commerce diffusion; exposure to harmful content is empirically discovered to be a barrier to e-commerce adoption.

However, few studies examine how gender differences in labor force participation and employment patterns affect ICT adoption in general, or Internet use in particular. This matters because employment and the types of jobs that men and women do correlate with different opportunities to access the Internet and develop digital skills, both of which contribute to overall Internet engagement. This study contributes to fill this gap by exploring how gender differences in employment affect the digital gender gap in four Latin American countries. The findings point to differences in employment patterns between men and women as the largest single contributor to the gender gap in Internet use in these countries, ahead of differences in other predictors of Internet use such as income, age and education. Further, our results suggest that the correlation between employment and Internet use is stronger among women than men, which we attribute to the fact that women tend to work in more ICT-intensive sectors (e.g., health services and education). Estimates from a decomposition analysis suggest that if women were employed at the same rate as men the gender digital gap in these countries would be reduced by at least a quarter. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Decomposition analysis; Digital gender gap; Labor markets; Latin America",""

Although the FRP system may have advantages over other payment technologies, a civil lawsuit over refusing to submit facial information and a series of illegal activities related to selling facial information have raised the public's privacy concerns, which might further engender Chinese users' resistance towards FRP. Based on privacy calculus theory and innovation resistance theory, this study builds a research model of FRP and examines it by using a cross-sectional study with 1200 Chinese users. The findings demonstrate that the perceived effectiveness of privacy policy has significant relationships with privacy control, perceived privacy risk, perceived benefits, and resistance. Both privacy control and perceived privacy risk are significantly related to privacy concerns. There is also a significant relationship between the perceived privacy risk and resistance to FRP. Meanwhile, privacy concerns positively affect user resistance, while perceived benefits negatively affect user resistance.

They have been applauded as a significant technological achievement, but also criticised as a dumb idea. Their application is rapidly expanding in the financial sector, public sector, supply chain management, and the automobile, real estate, insurance, and health care industries. With the growing use of smart contracts and an increasing variety of smart contracts applications, the debate over the legal implications of this phenomenon has intensified and many legal issues related to smart contracts are being examined. Legal scholars have highlighted potential legal pitfalls, controversies and incompatibilities with existing legal frameworks. Blockchain technology and smart contracts have also been fuelling an interest of legislators, who have begun to recognise regulatory uncertainties and are making the first attempts to introduce legislative solutions to address them. This paper aims to highlight the fervour of the scholarly debate surrounding smart contracts and contrast it with a rather modest response from the legislators thus far. The paper reiterates that smart contracts represent the future. Even though they challenge practitioners, scholars, and legislators, current legislative initiatives indicate that under most legal systems there are no major obstacles for smart contracts and to accommodate smart contracts within the existing legal frameworks we should expect legal evolution rather than revolution. © 2020","Blockchain; Contract laws; Smart contracts; Technology law",""

In particular, we show that given the ex post optimality of the current plan, a consumer tend to switch to plans with larger allowances when overuse the allowance, and switch to plans with smaller allowances when underuse the allowance. We also find that salience-based decision making is a consistent behavior pattern and heterogeneous among consumers. Finally, we show that more experienced consumers are more likely to avoid the upward bias but not the downward bias.

Although digital constitutionalism is encountering growing popularity, the prevalent non-binding nature of its initiatives, the discrepancy between the jurisdictional border and transnational digital processes, and the technological embedment of governance mechanisms, have hindered the effectiveness of its impact. This paper identifies epistemic communities as a crucial factor for the constitutionalization of the digital technologies since they have the necessary technical expertise and policy commitment to create norms and standards at transnational level, informing the policy choices of both state and non-state actors. In order to illustrate this nexus, the article performs an in-depth investigation on the case of the European Commission High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (HLEG-AI). The analysis revealed that the HLEG-AI effectively gathered an epistemic community strongly committed with fundamental rights promotion and capable to influence the following policy-making activities of the European Commission, as well as of other non-state stakeholders, whose involvement is essential in order to embed digital constitutionalism principles within the design of AI systems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Digital constitutionalism; Epistemic communities; Ethics; European commission; Internet governance",""

The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of ICT on socio-economic development in China by considering spatial effects. To understand the overall influence of ICT on socio-economic development, the study used principal component analysis (PCA) to establish composite ICT and socio-economic development indexes based on data collected from 31 provinces in the period 2009–2018. In applying the spatial panel data analysis, this article argues that a spatial Durbin model (SDM) with spatial fixed effects is the most suitable model for the purpose of making estimations. The results of the SDM suggest the socio-economic development of provinces contains strong spatial correlations. More specifically, although ICT plays an essential role in improving socio-economic development, the spatial spillover effects of ICT negatively affect the socio-economic development in adjacent areas, implying that a digital divide exists among China's provinces and that this digital gap can lead to unbalanced socio-economic development. The article concludes by outlining some practical policy recommendations for the advancement of ICT going forward to help alleviate the adverse effects of the digital divide and enhance the benefits of ICT-based socio-economic development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China; ICT; Socio-economic development; Spatial analysis",""

Surprisingly, there has been considerably less attention paid to ‘Wi-Fi 6’, the new IEEE 802.1ax standard in the family of Wireless Local Area Network technologies with features targeting private, edge-networks. This paper revisits the suitability of cellular and Wi-Fi in delivering high-speed wireless Internet connectivity. Both technologies aspire to deliver significantly enhanced performance, enabling each to deliver much faster wireless broadband connectivity, and provide further support for the Internet of Things and Machine-to-Machine communications, positioning the two technologies as technical substitutes in many usage scenarios. We conclude that both are likely to play important roles in the future, and simultaneously serve as competitors and complements. We anticipate that 5G will remain the preferred technology for wide-area coverage, while Wi-Fi 6 will remain the preferred technology for indoor use, thanks to its much lower deployment costs. However, the traditional boundaries that differentiated earlier generations of cellular and Wi-Fi are blurring. Proponents of one technology may argue for the benefits of their chosen technology displacing the other, requesting regulatory policies that would serve to tilt the marketplace in their favour. We believe such efforts need to be resisted, and that both technologies have important roles to play in the marketplace, based on the needs of heterogeneous use cases. Both technologies should contribute to achieving the goal of providing affordable, reliable, and ubiquitously available high-capacity wireless broadband connectivity. © 2021 The Authors","5G; 802.11; Broadband; Internet; Wi-Fi; Wireless",""

This plan aims to ensure the availability and take-up of very high-capacity fixed and wireless networks, in both urban and rural areas, among households and the main socio-economic drivers. The estimation model presented here uses a methodology supported by data at the local (NUTS3) level to give a bottom-up estimation of the investment gap for each of the EGS objectives, using three different scenarios depending on the mix of wired and wireless technologies offered. The methodology and estimation model used in the paper are examined against other examples and assumptions available in the literature. We also offer a dynamic perspective on the analysis of the evolution of this investment gap over the years 2017–2019, which includes an assessment of the usefulness of these estimation models. The paper concludes by identifying the need for new measures to attract investment from public and private sources, mostly in rural areas, since purely market-driven initiatives fall short by about two-thirds of the required total investment. We also highlight how estimation models, despite their apparent complexity and number of assumptions, have a proven capacity to provide sufficiently accurate figures to guide policy action at the local, regional, national and supra-national levels. The usefulness of these estimation models could be enhanced by the availability of homogeneous and stable information on socio-demographics and on the level of coverage and take-up of broadband networks, at least at NUTS3 level. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","5G; Broadband networks deployment models; European gigabit society; Fibre networks; High-speed broadband networks; Investment gap; Rural areas; Wireless networks",""

It is crucial to consider spatial accessibility's impacts on equity and inclusiveness of public libraries. A method is proposed to evaluate the equity of spatial accessibility to library resources and services across population groups. Spatial accessibility is measured in two ways: the closest-based and quantity-based measurements that respectively characterize the level of accessibility to the closest one and to diverse resources according to travel distance and travel time in road networks. Two approaches are applied for equity evaluation with socioeconomic and demographic indicators of census tracts, including the minority population, non-adults, and population in poverty. The method is applied to examine the physical locations of public libraries in four major cities of the U.S with diverse population composition. Results show spatial inequity for socially disadvantaged populations in the cities of Washington DC, Baltimore, and Chicago. Inequity is more prominent for non-adults and minority populations in DC and Baltimore.

However, the role of ICTs has brought with it numerous legal and regulatory challenges as well as an exacerbating criminal enterprise through cybercrime. Despite this, the evidence on the role of ICTs in improving the quality of life (QoL) is mixed and the exact nature of this relationship is not yet well understood especially at the global level. Existing information systems research has examined generally the effects of ICTs on the QoL at individual country level but there remains a gap in the understanding of the association between specific ICTs such as mobile penetration and QoL. In this study, we examine the effects of mobile penetration and QoL on one hand, and the mediating effects of ICT regulation on the other. We rely on the capability approach and archival data from 114 countries whilst employing Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling as the data analysis method. Our results show support for only the association of ICT regulation and QoL and prove that the mediating effects of ICT regulation is not significant. Our findings suggest that to enhance the QoL, practitioners and policymakers should emphasize ICT regulation to protect the privacy and security of individuals online to achieve the needed benefits.

Consequently, many countries are searching for effective solutions to narrow digital divides. This paper proposes a framework that can help to design more effective policies for the expansion of broadband. Building on research on the drivers of broadband investment, the model assists in delineating geographic areas where commercial operators are unlikely to provide service without additional incentives. Furthermore, it helps to identify policy instruments that increase the attractiveness of an area to investors. Such knowledge facilitates the design, prioritization, and targeting of supply-side and demand-side policy measures. The article utilizes data from the fixed broadband market in Brazil to demonstrate the potential uses and benefits of the approach. The model is flexible and can be tailored to other countries.

While digitalization of public libraries already attracted significant scholarly attention, the evidence of its contribution to the acquisition of cultural skills and knowledge and social mobility remains limited, as does the conceptual understanding of links between digitalization, cultural capital, and social stratification. This article draws on two disconnected bodies of research, the sociological analysis of cultural capital and stratification and research on digital divides. To bridge these two bodies of research, the interplay of cultural and digital capital in public libraries was investigated. The extensive dataset from the UK Taking Part Survey (2016–17) was analyzed using two-step cluster analysis and multinomial regression models to explore the contrasting profiles of contemporary library users. Results identify four distinct user groups: Traditional, Active, Family, and Tech Access, which possess different degrees of cultural and digital capital, have different demographic profiles, and benefit from digitalized libraries in different ways. If libraries are to fulfil their role in reducing social inequalities, it is important that they tailor their digital services to the specific characteristics of each user group. This approach also provides a useful template for exploring the interplay of digitalization and (in)equality in other cultural institutions. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Cultural capital; Digital capital; Digital divide; Internet; Public libraries",""

In parallel, according to the lesser evil principle, it is also anticipated that people will be less supportive of regulating fake news if they are aware that there are other non-regulatory counter fake news solutions such as fact-checking. Using original survey data collected from the three countries (n = 5218) and multi-group SEM, it is found that while the first hypothesis holds for all three countries, the second one holds only for Japan and South Korea (the two mature democracies), but not for Thailand (the semi-democratic country).

In this context, the purpose of our article is to investigate how the growing effort to harness mobile money designed for unbanked individuals may help to overcome barriers to access formal financial services. Using a unique dataset obtained from an individual-level survey conducted in Burkina Faso, we explore the interplay between mobile money innovation and pre-existing formal and informal financial instruments. Our main findings show that, overall there are no differences in the inclination of mobile money users and non-users to make deposits in formal or informal deposit instruments. However, a closer investigation reveals suggestive evidence that it may increase the probability of participants in informal mechanisms to make deposits in formal financial instruments, especially using a bank account. Moreover, considering disadvantaged groups, we find for women, irregular income and less educated individuals that mobile money may increase their probability to make deposits in a bank and/or credit union accounts. Our results are robust to using instrumental variables and propensity score matching techniques that mitigate the endogeneity problem. They also pass a number of robustness checks as well as considering an alternative dataset. Given the low access to formal financial services in developing countries, our findings taken together indicate how the increasing adoption of mobile money may act as a stepping-stone towards financial inclusion.

Beyond its technical aspects, 5G has become a question of security and national interest for many States as well as an international policy issue. Technological autonomy and digital sovereignty are increasingly recognised as strategic priorities on a global scale. In this context, the EU's position is unique, basically for two reasons. On the one hand, the EU has unintentionally become part of the playing field in the US-China dispute over technology companies and 5G. On the other hand, any policy of the EU or its Member States is constrained by the nature of 5G as an area of either European or national competence. The delimitation of their competences is not clear, just as there is no transparent and understandable distinction of their 5G responsibilities. In order to clarify this situation, a comprehensive analysis of the European competence and legal frameworks is necessary. After that, the study of the evolution process of this European policy provides an overview of its scope and limits.

The main objective of this paper is to study the gaps that occur in the use of internet services by households in Spain during the period 2007–2019 and to become useful in the design of policies addressed to narrow specific digital divides. The data is a panel obtained from the ICT-H Survey on Households of the National Statistics Institute. This paper defines the gaps as the differences in the use of internet services across individual consumers. A selected group of twelve digital services are considered: e-commerce, e-selling, e-tourism, e-learning, e-health, e-banking, e-government, VoIP, chat, email, cloud services, and social networks. The second level digital gaps are analyzed in each service according to six relevant socio-demographic characteristics: gender, age, education, digital skills, population size, and income. A set of graphs show the evolution of the gaps. Gaps are narrowing in most dimensions and specific characteristics, but not in others such as age, education, and digital skills. The gaps reveal the evolution of digitization and in some cases of digital exclusion for specific groups. Specific knowledge about digital gaps is useful for policymakers, since closing the digital divide is an explicit policy goal in this country, as well as in other parts of Europe. Then, a dynamic panel data model was proposed and estimated using Arellano and Bond techniques. A dynamic/network effect was found, as well as other socio-demographic determinants. Finally, the paper contains conclusions, policy recommendations and an agenda for future research. The policy recommendations consist of digital education programs targeted at the most exposed groups such as the elderly, the less well-educated and people with lower digital skills. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Digital divide; Digital gaps; Dynamic panel data model; Individual panel data; Internet services",""

In 2015, the Italian Government introduced the “ultrabroadband strategy”, an ambitious policy agenda addressing the NGA market failures. This paper assesses the procurement policy assigning public concessions to build and manage passive infrastructure in “NGA white areas”: in detail, the techno-economic properties and outcomes of the auctions are analyzed, both theoretically and empirically. Because the applicable procurement law was the EU one, the EMAT scoring rules were mandatory. Relevant findings stand out, which confirm the received wisdom on first-price auctions, and extend it to high-tech sectors, where EMAT remains under-researched. First, the concession auctions unleashed vibrant bidding competition in many white areas, which enabled substantial budget savings. Second, the quality scoring rules provided adequate flexibility to prioritize the procurement of the most innovative and pro-competitive architectures (FTTH/B/P), despite the presence of high uncertainty. Third, the EMAT framework catered for a multidimensional procurement agenda; the latter targeted efficient and innovative procurement, universal service and higher market competition, while accommodating the ambitious industrial policy of the Government. Evidence of a potential trade-off between the plan implementation delay and its innovativeness emerged; such a conflict was eventually exacerbated by the bandwidth shortages generated by the COVID-19 crisis. By providing the very first study on EMAT auctions for broadband, this work stimulates future comparative research on additional EU member States. © 2020","EMAT/MEAT; First-price sealed-bid auction; Industrial policy; Market competition; NGA; Public procurement",""

Poverty is measured with the poverty headcount ratio at national poverty lines (% of the population) while inequality is proxied by the Gini coefficient, the Atkinson index and the Palma ratio. The ICT dynamics are measured with ‘internet access in school’, ‘virtual social network’, ‘personal computers’ ‘mobile phone penetration”, ‘internet penetration’ and ‘fixed broadband subscriptions’. The empirical evidence is based on interactive Generalized Method of Moments estimators from which thresholds are computed contingent on the validity of tested hypotheses. First, the Gini coefficient should not exceed 0.5618 in order for ‘internet access in school’ to positively affect inclusive education. Second, the poverty headcount ratio at national poverty lines (% of the population) should remain below 33.6842% in order for ‘internet access in school’ to favorably influence inclusive education.

We used the three core ICT indicators (i.e. fixed-phone subscribers, mobile-phone subscribers, and internet users) individually and in composite index form developed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To estimate the long run relationship, study used the multiple cointegration tests like panel cointegration and Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square (FMOLS) technique and Panel VECM model particularly to investigate the short-run dynamics. Study finds that, ICT penetration in both forms (i.e. ICT composite index and its individual form) have a long run positive relationship with the economic growth of South Asian economies, supporting the leapfrogging hypothesis.

Employing a panel data comprising 45 Sub-Saharan Africa countries over the period 1996–2017, we find that digital infrastructure contributes positively to services sector employment. However, further analyses reveal that the positive effect of digital infrastructure on services sector employment depends on education, institutional quality, and macroeconomic conditions as captured by the inflation rate. In particular, we find that the positive effect of digital infrastructure on services sector employment increases as institutional quality becomes better, while poor macroeconomic conditions decrease the effect of digital infrastructure on employment in services. We also find evidence suggesting that the effect of digital infrastructure on employment in the services sector tends to benefit countries at low levels of education. © 2021 The Authors","Digital infrastructure; Employment; ICT; Services sector; Sub-Saharan Africa",""

This time around, the Narendra Modi government's measures applied to 86.4% of the banknotes and coins in circulation, the equivalent to 11% of GDP. Much analysis has been undertaken on the demonetization. This has largely been critical because of its disastrous consequences on local populations and the most deprived among them. Our paper adopts a different angle: it argues that demonetization has had a key impact on the digitalization of payments. We use data from the Reserve Bank of India from 2014 to 2020 to show that the demonetization period brought about a decline in Automatic Teller Machines (ATM) withdrawals. It equally boosted the adoption of digital means of payments, via Point of Sale Terminals (POS) and mobile banking. Since October 2016, the number of POS transactions has risen almost threefold, while the number of ATM transactions has decreased by almost one-fifth. The current government's rhetoric is to promote digitalization as a means of both formalizing the economy and protecting the poor.

Using a rural region in Northern New York (USA), we consider the investment and operational costs of a broadband cooperative and determine service prices for which it is financially viable. Service prices need to increase 75%–131%, depending on grant restrictions, relative to existing market prices for a new broadband cooperative to become financially feasible. Put differently, the cooperative would not cash flow at market prices unless there was at least 14 potential subscribers per mile at a 62% take rate. For a cooperative, the grant restriction that providers offer a minimum level of speed at a maximum price results in a high level of subsidization by high-speed to low-speed members to support the business. Given grant funding and member equity investments, financial infeasibility has little to do with construction costs, than with annual operational and maintenance costs required to sustain the system long term. More reasonable feasibility scenarios occur for existing utility cooperatives expanding services into broadband, particularly areas with a high proportion of high-speed, year-round users and strong take rates. Consideration of public benefits of broadband arguably needs to be added to the equation, particularly surrounding access to healthcare and educational purposes, and as a prerequisite to supporting taxpayer-funded public-private partnerships to expand broadband services. Policy levers to eliminate or subsidize property taxes and pole rental costs reduce cash flow prices considerably; however, feasibility is highly sensitive to assumed take rates. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cooperatives; Cumulative cash flow analysis; Financial feasibility; Rural broadband",""

Using a comprehensive measure of digitization that encompasses the commonly used proxies of financial technology (Fintech) and employing a System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) panel estimation methodology on annual data over the period 2004–2018, this paper examines the impact of digitization, as a proxy of Fintech, on the inflow of remittances for a sample of 34 developed and developing countries. Our analysis provides an interesting case study on Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS), known as five emerging markets with a great number of workers out of abroad but below the average level of digital transfers. Using the Digital Ecosystem Development Index developed by Katz and Callorda (2018), the results of the paper uncover a statistically significant nonlinear relationship between the improvement in digitization measures and the inflow of remittances with an exact threshold level. More specifically, our results indicate that improvement in digitization may initially increase the remittances inflow leading to an increase in the stock of remittances received. Nevertheless, once the digitization index reaches its threshold level further improvement in digitization tends decrease as penetration increases, giving rise to a decline in the rate of remittances inflow. This result implies that the marginal effect of the digital penetration is larger when at its lower level, before the threshold level. For countries such as the BRICS, with a level of digitization below the average of our sample, policy makers should apply more aggressive and comprehensive policies to recoup the maximum gains of a digital ecosystem. Hence, our policy implications are directed towards increasing the investments in developing human capacity including carrying different skill development training programs to prepare individuals for the information age, expanding the internet coverage and speed especially in educational establishments, encouraging the use and access of electronic banking by consumers, producers, and governments, and taking cyber security and fraud protection more seriously to encourage the flow of remittances, especially in light of its renewed utility due to the recent pandemic. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","BRICS; Digitization; Financial inclusion; FinTech; Remittances",""

After analyzing the applications found in the literature, we have conducted interviews with senior executives responsible for AI in telecommunications, electricity, gas and water companies headquartered in North America and Europe, as well as with suppliers incorporating AI into their equipment. These interviews have provided information on which AI applications are actually being used in these network industries and which are expected to be implemented in the future. While some of these AI applications, like predictive maintenance, have already been implemented today by most operators, more complex applications, such as traffic management AIs for 5G, are being considered by only a few large operators. Finally, the paper explores the consequences of AI for regulation. At the least, regulators will need to understand AI in order to determine if AI applications raise regulatory concerns.

However, beyond apparent similarities, mobile broadband is used in different ways according to countries specificities. For instance, among the non-mobile owners in Nigeria, the unemployed are the most likely to use mobile broadband, most probably for job search practices, while it is rather used by students for information gathering in other countries.

Even though it may appear as if the pendulum swung back to the previous 1990s period of government-led development, this paper argues persistent regional disparities in access and adoption of new technologies generated a need for public action in the second reform. By analyzing the Mexican case and comparing the policy choices in each one of the reforms, this paper sheds light on how particular policy decisions in the first reform generated inefficient market solutions and were key in creating a perception of the need for stronger public action. In both reforms, the policymaking process was carried out by a small elite that negotiated its contents behind closed doors. Paradoxically, within the transition to democracy, in the second reform, the leaders of the major political parties established a closed-door agreement. Even though the 2013 telecommunications reform improved the status quo, it did not decrease market concentration and, once again, we face low levels of investment and high levels of digital exclusion. By reconstructing the policy decision process in each reform, this paper argues that the closed-door policy choices taken, which were the result of the interaction of political actors with their own agenda and interests, hampered the most efficient solutions. © 2020","Institutions; Latin America; Mexico; Telecommunications reform",""

FTTC VDSL is the most widespread technology used for NGA network deployments in Europe but the coverage of VDSL networks is still limited in rural areas. FTTdp networks using G.fast have been proposed as a cost-effective and future-proof alternative to FTTH and FTTB especially in rural areas where FTTC and VDSL cannot always deliver service speeds of 30 Mbps which is the minimum bandwidth defined in the European Digital Agenda as a target to be met by 2020. However, the new target of EU Commission for Gigabit Society and 100 Mbps connections, upgradable to 1 Gbps, for all households in 2025 are unlikely to be achieved by VDSL Vectoring and other copper-based technologies. On the other hand, Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) networks based on LTE technology can be used as a “last mile” solution to provide high-speed broadband access to areas where fixed broadband is limited. LTE technology offers high-speed connections able to support internet browsing and IP services, while it can theoretically support up to 300 Mbps depending on network load and sharing. Thus, it can be considered a viable alternative to other fixed network solutions especially when considering future upgrades to 5G networks that promise gigabit speeds per user. In this paper, a techno-economic study is performed to assess the feasibility of an FWA network deployment based on LTE technology in comparison to FTTdp G.fast and FTTC VDSL network rollout for delivering service speeds of 30 Mbps in rural areas. A variety of different population density, competition and regulation policy scenarios is considered.

The importance of these two frameworks, besides their leading normative roles, is that recent debates have shaped them as cases to consider in the adoption of the upcoming fifth generation (5G) of mobile communications technology, in particular in the C-band. A discussion on these two frameworks is organised by following the four-step decision-making guide for spectrum management developed by Pogorel (2007), which requires spectrum authorities to make decisions in four areas of spectrum management: frequency harmonization, technology standardization, type of usage rights and assignment procedures. Notwithstanding the similarities with respect to the four areas of spectrum management considered, the two frameworks differ on their implementation schedules. CBRS leads the way, with a handful of providers receiving government approval to manage spectrum access controllers, and as of mid 2020, scheduled to have allocated spectrum licenses on half of its available spectrum. On the contrary, European countries have shown scarce interest towards implementing the LSA, despite the extensive work carried out by regulatory and standardization bodies. This may suggest that there are external contextual factors which influence the successful implementation of spectrum sharing frameworks. An interesting aspect which deserves further investigation is the institutional context in which decisions related to radio spectrum management are taken. Unlike the US authorities, European institutions do not possess coercive enforcement powers with respect to spectrum sharing. This key difference may contribute to explaining the different speed at which LSA and CBRS are implemented. © 2020","5G; C-band; CBRS; LSA; Spectrum sharing; Verticals",""

In this context, digital information and communications technologies (ICTs) are of increasing importance as a means for people to gain access to health or social services, employment opportunities, information and social networks. In this article we draw on our recent case study research to examine the policy (and politics) shaping implementation of Australia's National Broadband Network (NBN) and its likely effects on equity of access to high speed broadband (HSB) services. We monitored NBN policy and implementation from 2015 to 2018 through policy documents, reports, and media. To assess likely effects of NBN policy on implementation and subsequently on equity of access to HSB we: a) applied a framework defining four elements of equity of access; and b) analysed stakeholder views drawn from media articles and 22 interviews with experts on NBN policy including politicians, government staff, and industry representatives. We found that equity considerations competed with political and commercial imperatives during the rollout of the NBN. This resulted in positive and negative consequences for equity of access to HSB, with a change in policy and implementation in 2013 bringing greater risks to equity of access. The case study provides a framework for considering equity in the implementation of next generation telecommunications infrastructure and highlights the importance of considering equity in the evaluation of telecommunications infrastructure. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Broadband; Equity of access; Health; Infrastructure; Telecommunications",""

Interviews including 20 librarians from 19 different institutions were conducted to collect data about their decision-making processes when purchasing e-book products. Institutional theory was used as a framework to analyze interview data. Librarians' perceptions of the environment where their decision process occurred were described as full of uncertainty, with the e-book market viewed as non-competitive with limited alternative products. Seven strategies the interviewees adopted to justify their purchase decisions were then identified, including experimentation, incorporating users' input, reliance on written documents, learning from past experiences, learning from other libraries, group decision, and aggressive negotiation. Decision-making processes were a mixture of institutional and rational actions. Factors affecting rationality in librarians' e-book purchase decisions could be applied to other types of decision-making in library settings, allowing stakeholders to better understand and interpret the situations that either help or hinder the rationality in library's decision-making. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","",""

We identify two waves of State Aid for broadband: one for the deployment of basic broadband, and a more recent one for the roll out of next-generation access networks. The use of State Aid is very heterogeneous across Member States, with a few large countries representing the bulk of the cases. The objective of most plans is to expand broadband coverage. The typical project relies mainly on public funds, and involves a direct grant, an open tender, and a contract for 3–5 years. Access obligations are imposed on networks deployed with State Aid, using a benchmarking approach in most cases.

TV-VOD is therefore of strategic importance to providers in terms of their current sales share and future growth. Focusing on the time-shift characteristics of TV-VOD and the serial complementarity of television programs, this study examines how various factors such as the characteristics of paid vs. free VOD services, and the average and variance of broadcast ratings affect VOD viewing patterns. An empirical analysis was conducted using data for TV-VODs of all television programs broadcast by major Korean broadcasters in 2015. The key findings are as follows: (1) There is an inverted-U shape relationship between broadcast ratings and TV-VOD views. This implies that there exists a positive window effect between the original broadcast and TV-VOD, with an exceptional substitution effect in segments with very high ratings. (2) Even if the average ratings are similar, there are more VOD views for programs that have a large fluctuation in ratings between episodes, mainly due to serial complementarity. (3) In terms of the distribution of VOD views over time, the initial concentration is higher in paid VOD packages and dramas, which implies that immediate decay appears for TV-VOD content because of subscriber preferences for novelty and the serial nature of drama shows. The study concludes with various implications for VOD service providers and policy makers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Broadcast ratings; Distribution channel; IPTV; Video on demand; Window effect",""

While with traditional electronic communications services (ECS) economic theory and consumer interests align as regards interoperability since multi-homing across various operators is the exemption, it is not yet clear whether that is also true for NI-ICS for which multi-homing is the norm. Our paper draws on an online survey of n = 2044 consumers in Germany covering traditional ECS, email and 22 other NI-ICS to address this issue from a consumer point of view. We find that people proactively use the boundaries between communications services to compartmentalize their social contacts according to relationship closeness. Our finding echoes indications provided in a rich stream of computer-mediated communication (CMC) research and in particular psychological theories of relationship development. Specifically, people appear to follow a finely tuned cultural code implying a hierarchical order of communications services used depending on the closeness of the contacts. Consequently, our results provide a complementary explanation of how and why certain groups of social ties converge to a specific (set of) communications service(s) beyond network effects and shed a critical light on current policy debates around an interoperability obligation for interpersonal communications applications.

As part of its approval of the Comcast-NBCU merger in 2011, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandated a “voluntary commitment” by Comcast to introduce a low-income broadband program that Comcast has branded “Internet Essentials (IE).” We use data from the U.S. Census Current Population Survey (CPS) and the National Broadband Map and a differences-in-differences approach to evaluate the program's effects on subscription rates for eligible households. We find that between 2011, when the program began, and 2015, broadband adoption by eligible households—those with school-age children who were eligible for free or reduced-price school lunches—had increased by more among households that lived in areas in which Comcast provided broadband internet service than among households that lived in areas served by other cable providers. In our difference-in-differences approach, we estimate that about 66 percent of IE subscribers represent true increases in low-income adoption as a result of the program, with the remaining subscribers being households that switched from a competitor and households that would have subscribed as part of a general upward trend in adoption. We find that CPS survey respondents in IE eligible households had small and insignificant increases their likelihood of taking online courses or job training in Comcast territory relative to similar households residing in the territories of other cable providers and they showed no difference in the propensity to apply for jobs online. These results provide no evidence to support internet literacy training. We also did not find robust effects of some of the program's other components. In particular, IE makes computers available for $150, but we found no difference in the change in low-income computer ownership across cable territories. As a result, it would be hard to conclude that subsidized computers made a difference in broadband subscription despite the visceral appeal of such programs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Broadband; Demand; Elasticity; Low-income subsidy; Telecommunications",""

AI is already deployed widely and has a high impact on work and daily life activities. The continuation of this process will likely contribute to deep economic and social changes. To realise the tremendous benefits of AI while mitigating undesirable effects will require enlightened responses by many stakeholders. Varying national institutional, economic, political, and cultural conditions will influence how AI will affect convenience, efficiency, personalisation, privacy protection, and surveillance of citizens. Many expect that the winners of the AI development race will dominate the coming decades economically and geopolitically, potentially exacerbating tensions between countries. Moreover, nations are under pressure to protect their citizens and their interests—and even their own political stability—in the face of possible malicious or biased uses of AI. On the one hand, these different stressors and emphases in AI development and deployment among nations risk a fragmentation between world regions that threatens technology evolution and collaboration. On the other hand, some level of differentiation will likely enrich the global AI ecosystem in ways that stimulate innovation and introduce competitive checks and balances through the decentralisation of AI development. International cooperation, typically orchestrated by intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations, private sector initiatives, and by academic researchers, has improved common welfare and avoided undesirable outcomes in other technology areas. Because AI will most likely have more fundamental effects on our lives than other recent technologies, stronger forms of cooperation that address broader policy and governance challenges in addition to regulatory and technological issues may be needed. At a time of great challenges among nations, international policy coordination remains a necessary instrument to tackle the ethical, cultural, economic, and political repercussions of AI. We propose to advance the emerging concept of technology diplomacy to facilitate the global alignment of AI policy and governance and create a vibrant AI innovation system.

The aim of this article is to identify substantial properties of spectrum access approaches to assess their suitability to 5G vertical use cases. We have defined five optional spectrum access scenarios for 5G vertical network service providers (VNSPs) in acquiring spectrum access to provide a network service to either end users or other companies. The stakeholders involved in the spectrum awarding process are identified, and their roles and targets are examined. Furthermore, the advantages and drawbacks of each scenario are covered. Following the discussion, we were able to highlight some substantive characteristics in terms of suitability assessment, namely reliability, locality and mobility, mobile network operators (MNOs) involvement, costs and time scale. These characteristics were analysed in terms of each scenario to further the scenario's suitability assessment to VNSPs' purposes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","5G communications; Radio spectrum access; Spectrum sharing; Vertical use cases",""

This study examines the reasons for this decline by analyzing the Korea Media Panel (KMP) data of the period 2011–2018 using a random-effects logit model. An empirical analysis indicates that a household is less likely to subscribe to print newspapers, as its family members spend less time reading newspaper articles, and as they are more likely to rely on the Internet for access to newspaper articles. In other words, print newspaper subscriptions have declined due to two reasons, namely, a decrease in the demand for newspaper articles and the emergence of online newspapers as a substitute for print newspapers. Next, this study identifies the socioeconomic factors affecting the demand for newspaper articles and the substitutability between print and online newspapers by applying a random-effects tobit model to the KMP data. One of the main results demonstrate that young and less educated individuals tend to spend less time reading newspaper articles, whether print or online.

Three inequality indicators are used, namely: the Gini coefficient, the Atkinson index and the Palma ratio. The adopted ICT indicators are mobile phone penetration, internet penetration and fixed broadband subscriptions. Three gender economic inclusion indicators are also used for the analysis, namely: female labour force participation, female unemployment and female employment. The Generalised Method of Moments is employed as empirical strategy. The findings show that enhancing ICT beyond certain thresholds is necessary for ICT to mitigate inequality in order to enhance gender economic participation. First, for female labour force participation, a minimum threshold of 165.714 mobile phone penetration per 100 people is required for the Palma ratio. Second, minimum ICT thresholds for the reduction of female unemployment are: (i) 87.783, 107.486 and 152.500 mobile phone penetration per 100 people for respectively, the Gini coefficient, the Atkinson index and the Palma ratio; (ii) 39.618 internet penetration per 100 people for the Atkinson index and (iii) 4.500 fixed broadband subscritptions for the Palma ratio. Third, the corresponding ICT thresholds for the promotion of female employment are: (i) 120.369 and 85.533 mobile phone penetration per 100 people for respectively, the Gini coefficient and the Atkinson index and (ii) 30.005 internet penetration per 100 people for the Gini coefficient.

For any country, sustainable economic growth is essential for a steadfast and well-balanced development of the entire country. One of the important factors supporting sustainable economic growth is the telecommunications technology and innovation, considering their role and functions as a modern-day indispensable infrastructure. It provides an opportunity for economic development compatible with the safeguard of the environment. Therefore, this study examines whether and to what extent telecommunications technology and innovation have helped improve the economic growth of developed and developing countries. We also aim to investigate the non-linear or kink effect in the relationship between the variables of telecommunications technology and innovation and economic growth. This study analyzes the impacts of telecommunications technology and innovation on economic growth at two different levels. First, we investigate the impact on individual countries which are distinct from one another regarding the level of economic development and the physical structure. Besides, the relationship between telecommunications development and the economic growth of a country may not be linear in the structure which necessitates our use of the kink regression model to capture and explain it. Second, this relationship is later investigated at the group level of countries. We divide the countries into two groups, developing and developed, based on the level of economic development and telecommunications technology. Empirically, we find that (Adak, 2015): there exists the kink effect on the relationship between telecommunications development and the economic growth in both developed and developing countries (Agnew & Romeo, 1981), the impacts of some related variables differ in magnitude depending on their levels and kink points, and (Alshubiri et al., 2019) the telecommunications technology and innovation give a relatively more massive impact on the economic growth of developing countries compared to developed countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Developing and developed countries; Economic growth; Kink regression; Telecommunications technology and innovation",""

The regulatory framework, particularly that adopted in EU member states, reflected this pattern of relatively homogeneous deployment achieved, in part, by decades of cross-subsidised pricing and universal service goals. Perhaps because of this legacy, telecommunications regulators have often adopted the presumption that relevant markets are national in character, unless proven otherwise Although geographically-variegated regulatory remedies have been permitted (even in the face of allegedly national relevant markets) and adopted in many member states, many regulators have never done so, and overly cautious thresholds for permitting geographically based forbearance suggest a continued bias towards presuming national markets and remedies. We find that this presumption of uniformity and the tendency to aggregate geographic markets together is not supported by first principles of antitrust analysis, although there may have been strong practical reasons to apply this presumption in the past circumstances of the telecommunications and broadband industries. On the ground, however, there has arguably never been as much heterogeneity across geographies and across technological solutions that provide effective ultra-fast broadband speeds. Both technological (i.e., product market) and geographic heterogeneity are likely to increase with the advent of mobile 5G networks. With their deployment, a cautious regulatory stance towards geographic variation and a cautious regulatory stance towards inter-technology or inter-modal competition may result in regulation that could exceed what is required to ensure effective competition and could instead distort the incentives to enter of facilities-based actors. This may also result in higher-cost and inefficient investment. A more geographically varied and technologically agnostic regulatory framework may satisfy the principle of proportionate and focused regulation—with the possibility that the locus of regulation shifts from the access network to bottleneck facilities such as fibre, ducts and poles. This discussion is especially germane when one considers the highly speculative nature of forecasts and projections about future demand, and the competing claims of proponents of 5G and fibre. While there is some scepticism about the performance of mobile networks, we note that pure mobile and fixed 5G services may have synergies in deployment, and that the idea of competing with residential broadband services is a core strategy of very influential large-scale industry actors. In terms of a future research agenda, regulatory decisions could benefit from much more research into the relationship between domestic and global bandwidth constraints and their influence on development of software and application, as well as much more quantitative research by academics on the drivers of bandwidth demand. The risks associated with promoting investment that results in large-scale wasted resources should also be central to the regulatory agenda. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Antitrust; Industrial organization; Market definition; Regulation; Telecommunications",""

Yet, the public sector's predicament is a tragic double bind: its obligations to protect citizens from potential algorithmic harms are at odds with the temptation to increase its own efficiency - or in other words - to govern algorithms, while governing by algorithms. Whether such dual role is even possible, has been a matter of debate, the challenge stemming from algorithms' intrinsic properties, that make them distinct from other digital solutions, long embraced by the governments, create externalities that rule-based programming lacks. As the pressures to deploy automated decision making systems in the public sector become prevalent, this paper aims to examine how the use of AI in the public sector in relation to existing data governance regimes and national regulatory practices can be intensifying existing power asymmetries. To this end, investigating the legal and policy instruments associated with the use of AI for strenghtening the immigration process control system in Canada; “optimising” the employment services” in Poland, and personalising the digital service experience in Finland, the paper advocates for the need of a common framework to evaluate the potential impact of the use of AI in the public sector. In this regard, it discusses the specific effects of automated decision support systems on public services and the growing expectations for governments to play a more prevalent role in the digital society and to ensure that the potential of technology is harnessed, while negative effects are controlled and possibly avoided. This is of particular importance in light of the current COVID-19 emergency crisis where AI and the underpinning regulatory framework of data ecosystems, have become crucial policy issues as more and more innovations are based on large scale data collections from digital devices, and the real-time accessibility of information and services, contact and relationships between institutions and citizens could strengthen – or undermine - trust in governance systems and democracy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Algorithmic accountability; Artificial intelligence; Automated decision making; Public sector innovation",""

One of the most (apparently) dramatic reversals of this trend has occurred in Australia where the federal government has set up a state-owned company (NBN Co) to fully replace and upgrade the fixed-line infrastructure for voice and broadband communications for the entire country. Some argued that the NBN heralded a reversal of a “failed, neoliberal” deregulation and pro-competition policy agenda in Australia, and a return to “social democratic” values. The NBN has attracted interest as a possible model for other governments looking to fund broadband infrastructure. The NBN Co's network is nearing completion. It has proved disappointing in many ways, with costs escalations, missed deadlines and a downscaling of the original full-fibre footprint to a mixed technology model (MTM). It has also proved politically divisive, with some claiming the MTM changes represent the reassertion of a neoliberal political agenda. In this paper, we trace the evolution of the fixed-line telecommunications industry in Australia from the 1980s to the present along the dimensions of privatisation, deregulation and competition in voice, broadband and policy settings. We find that contrary to popular political rhetoric, the Australian industry reforms have been characterised by only a partial and inconsistent progression towards the international policy objectives. In particular, ongoing government ownership of the incumbent created perverse incentives for both regulatory and industry actors and ensured political involvement in import network investment and operations decisions which in other jurisdictions are delegated to private-sector owners and regulators at arms-length from political influence. We contend that the NBN was not a social democratic response to failed neoliberal policies, nor was the MTM a neoliberal reassertion. Rather, the politicisation of the NBN is a function of the inability to decentralise ownership and control of the industry away from the government. These issues will continue to dominate the Australian debate, as the statutory context requires the privatisation of the NBN within five years of its projected 2021 completion. Extreme caution is warranted for jurisdictions looking to the NBN model for guidance. © 2020","Australia; Broadband; Fibre; FTTH; FTTN; FTTP; New Zealand; Next-generation networks; Public investment; Public-private partnership; Telecommunications regulation",""

In the dynamic emerging economy of Turkey, they are of even greater interest to mobile operators as they surpass their peers in many advanced economies in terms of use intensity.

However, it is still unclear what effects this new regulation could have on competition and, consequently, on innovation in digital markets. Therefore, this paper analyzes the effect of data portability driven by competition on the data-driven innovation response of online platforms such as Spotify, Google, and Facebook. We conduct an empirical analysis of Spotify, which is an online platform facing competition within the EU, and perform a comparison between data portability to number portability of the telecommunication sector to predict the future impact of the new regulation. Finally, we compare the observations on Spotify with Facebook and Google, which are companies in winner-takes-all markets. We argue that online platforms like Spotify, which face competition within the EU, will invest in two forms of data-driven innovation due to the effect of data portability. These types are ‘exploitation-innovation,’ by improving the existing technology, and ‘exploration-innovation’ by developing new technology. In ‘exploitation-innovation,’ firms, like Spotify, will increase investments in data-driven innovation to enhance users' engagement and retention to avoid churn.

We find that there is a negative relationship between cable network coverage and FTTx network expansion. This restraining effect associated with cable networks contradicts the current regulatory regime, which is primarily designed to enable effective competition against the incumbent on copper- and fibre-based infrastructure. Therefore, our analysis is a crucial first step to design a sound regulatory and competitive framework to achieve the ambitious broadband targets set by the European Commission and national governments. Most importantly, we conclude that public policy makers should assess broadband markets distinctly for cable and non-cable regions to reflect the competition dynamics between cable operators and operators investing in FTTx networks. © 2020","Cable networks; FTTx; Inter-platform competition; Regulation; Telecommunications",""

On the one hand, macro-level approach in the empirical literature of network effects commonly use the assumption that a network's overall size matters more to consumers' decisions (global network effects). On the other hand, micro-level studies have suggested that social networks are more relevant to consumers' choices than the overall network size (local network effects). Based on microdata from five Latin American countries, we compare the choice of a particular operator over choosing the largest operator by individual consumers. Our research shows that country-level network size is one among a set factors that determine consumers' choices of mobile operators, once individual and operators' country presence heterogeneity are considered. We find that consumers' local network decisions are important for the choice of operator in the majority of cases considered, and that this result is conditional on the chosen operator's market share. Furthermore, network characteristics and consumer preferences, such as coverage, tariffs, and network importance also affect the choice of mobile network for the Latin American context. © 2020","Discrete choice analysis; Latin America; Mobile telecommunication; Network effect",""

Rather than embrace the customary commitment to achieve consensus on global spectrum allocations at the International Telecommunication Union (“ITU”), the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) has auctioned off large blocks of frequencies for the next generation (“5G”) of wireless services. The FCC might have framed its first 5G auction, reassigning Ultra High Frequency (“UHF”) spectrum, as a one-time deviation from compliance with long standing, intergovernmental coordination procedures. These frequencies have ideal signal propagation characteristics and the Commission could use financial incentives—unavailable in most nations—to expedite “repacking” by incumbent broadcasters willing to move, share or abandon spectrum in exchange for ample financial compensation. However, the FCC has continued to auction off 5G spectrum on grounds that it must find ways to abate an acute shortage of wireless bandwidth and doing so will regain or maintain global leadership in wireless technologies. This paper offers a critical rebuke to unilateral spectrum management, because the short-term benefits expected by the U. S. government likely will be offset by countervailing harms to 5G manufacturers, carriers and consumers. The paper tracks fractious preparation for the ITU's 2019 World Radio Conference by the U.S. delegation and the mixed record achieved there. Additionally, the paper explains how injecting trade, industrial policy and national security issues at the ITU can trigger more delays and disputes, including possible retaliation by nations displeased with U.S. efforts to subvert traditional technology optimization goals. A worst case scenario has the ITU deadlocked and unable to reach closure on “mission critical” spectrum planning issues at World Radio Conferences, convened every four years. The paper concludes that costs and likely challenges to the efficacy and legitimacy of the ITU will reduce the benefits accruing from the FCC's unilateral, spectrum planning campaign. © 2020","2019 world radio conference; 5G wireless; Broadband; Consensus building; Intergovermental coordination; International telecommunication union; Spectrum auctions; Spectrum management; Spectrum planning; Technology optimization",""

A series of non-linear time series techniques are employed to capture the complex dynamics among these variables. The outcomes of the study suggest that the import, FDI, and Index of Industrial Production (IIP) in the telecom sector share non-linear relationships that exhibit regime shifts, time-varying behavior, and asymmetry.

The tested hypothesis is confirmed because from a comparative analysis between African-specific estimates and those of the sampled countries, not all factors driving mobile money innovations in Africa are apparent in the findings of Lashitew et al.

Despite the potential that markets have to perform this task, it is still difficult to find real-world examples of successful secondary markets for spectrum. In this work, we explore a broader context where markets would be deployed to shed light on the different components that may affect their viability. Transactions that involve electromagnetic spectrum are generally extremely difficult to achieve due to the complexity of spectrum when treated as a tradeable commodity. To ease these difficulties, we start with the proposition the that many applications require wireless connectivity rather than simply spectrum. We proceed to consider a system where transactions for wireless connectivity are handled by a specialized intermediary that we refer to as Virtual Network Builder (VNB). The model we present accounts for technical definitions of spectrum as a commodity as an effort to bring diversity, and hence thickness, to the market. At the same time, we consider a more nuanced definition of market participants (Resource Providers (RPs) and Service Providers (SPs)), which allows us to examine their incentives to transact in the market and the consequences of their strategies. As a result, we are able to evaluate the performance of a market for wireless connectivity from multiple angles including the efficiency in resource assignment, profitability for market participants and overall conditions to market viability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","",""

In particular, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) subverted extant NN rules in the US and if the European Union (EU) decides to follow a similar deregulatory path in the future it could change the way telecommunications providers on both sides of the Atlantic lay down their optical-fibre network infrastructure investment plans. For instance, if traffic prioritization is allowed then diversification of revenue sources can be achieved by charging customers for privileged data delivery to their premises. Currently, NGANs roll-out throughout EU is an ongoing process in a setting whereby access regulation in the form of network element unbundling is already imposed. As a result, these legal developments form a new context within which it makes sense to assess the role of NGANs wholesale access pricing in tandem with the degree of commitment to NN rules so as to i) determine their combinatorial impact on private telecommunications operators' financial figures and ii) capture their competitive interactions.

This connectivity gap is mainly caused by the urban-oriented business models of traditional operators, which are not cost-effective in regions that are characterized by isolation, low population density, and scarcity of resources. This paper analyzes a feasible and sustainable strategy to deploy mobile communications services (voice and data) in isolated communities in developing countries with less than 1000 inhabitants by combining appropriate low-cost technologies and an innovative business model fostered by recent regulation. This innovative model is based on the legal figure of the SRO (Small Rural Operator), which is specifically oriented to reach small communities in isolated rural areas. The results are based on a real deployment in 6 communities of the Peruvian Amazon, which was carried out by a consortium of universities, NGOs (Non-Government Organizations), and cellular operators. This deployment allowed us to obtain practical information on the cost structure of mobile networks in isolated areas, characterize the rural demand and the revenues associated with it, and understand how the business model of traditional operators could be adapted. This information permitted us to propose, implement and validate the SRO approach. The paper shows the results of this research and provides some lessons learned.

Nevertheless, although it is spreading throughout our economies and societies in multiple ways, the absence of standardised classifications prevents us from obtaining a measure of its pervasiveness. In addition, AI cannot be identified as part of a specific sector, but rather as a transversal technology because the fields in which it is applied do not have precise boundaries. In this work, we address the need for a deeper understanding of this complex phenomenon by investigating economic agents’ involvement in industrial activities aimed to supply AI-related goods and services, and AI-related R&D processes in the form of patents and publications. In order to conduct this extensive analysis, we use a complex systems approach through the agent-artifact space model, which identifies the core dimensions that should be considered. Therefore, by considering the geographic location of the involved agents and their organisation types (i.e., firms, governmental institutions, and research institutes), we (i) provide an overview of the worldwide presence of agents, (ii) investigate the patterns in which AI technological subdomains subsist and scatter in different parts of the system, and (iii) reveal the size, composition, and topology of the AI R&D collaboration network. Based on a unique data collection of multiple micro-based data sources and supported by a methodological framework for the analysis of techno-economic segments (TES), we capture the state of AI in the worldwide landscape in the period 2009–2018. As expected, we find that major roles are played by the US, China, and the EU28. Nevertheless, by measuring the system, we unveil elements that provide new, crucial information to support more conscious discussions in the process of policy design and implementation. © 2020 The Authors","Agent-artifact space; Artificial intelligence; Complex systems; Natural language processing; Network analysis; Semantic analysis",""

For the first time in history, the Office of Electronic Communications decided to award spectrum by using an auction process. Polish regulators implemented a simultaneous multiple-round ascending-bid auction, which was widely used worldwide for selling spectrum. The process leading to the auction and the auction itself was lengthy and eventful. Due to the wrong auction design, the auction dragged on indefinitely, causing a delay in spectrum distribution. The auction ended only as a result of the government's intervention, after 8 months (513 rounds) of bidding that raised revenue of over PLN 9 billion (over EUR 2 billion). This paper describes in detail the rules of the Polish 4G auction, analyses bidding behaviour and auction dynamics of the crucial phases of auctions, and presents the final outcomes. It also draws lessons that could help policy makers in Poland and other countries in auction design. © 2020 The Author","Bidding behaviour; Non-binding bids; Polish LTE auction; SMRA; Spectrum auctions",""

Our historical analysis shows that during the industry's formative years, firms had different strategies for developing African markets in a relatively lax regulatory environment, with some local firms leading the way in generating innovations for adapting to inherent market and institutional challenges as well as in expanding their operations to multiple countries across Africa. While many firms exited over time, some, including a few multinationals, reoriented their strategy from targeting high-income consumers to serving the masses, and the industry benefited from the widespread diffusion of innovations, the establishment of allied industries, and low prices of handsets. However, as the industry matured, competition became mostly price-based, leading to consolidation. Authorities responded by increasing monitoring activities, taking a more “hands-on” regulatory approach. This study demonstrates that both policy and strategy coevolved in a path-dependent way as the industry gradually transitioned from the introductory phase into the growth and maturity phases. It also provides new insight into the development of the African mobile telecommunications industry, and extends and bridges the literatures on telecommunications policy and strategy, which evolved in insolation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Africa; Industrial evolution; Mobile telecommunications; Policy; Strategy",""

In a context of industry lobbying of governments to promote 5G, the paper attempts to bring clarity to just what are the critical issues, specifically for an industrial policy to deal with this novel but complex technology. Planning for 5G is a series of complicated choices as there are issues at the levels of creating ecosystems to support it, unproven business models, with claims for applications which may not be financially viable, yet, plus confusion over choices of radio spectrum, and selection of equipment suppliers, even potential issues over public health, as well as the real level of industrial and consumer demand beyond the hype. The emphasis here is on the importance of making balanced strategic choices, by identifying the basic issues, in a ‘realpolitik’ fashion - including why embrace 5G at all. The paper develops its insights from lessons learnt in the introduction of the previous mobile generation, LTE, also from policy studies on small cells and on designing auctions for 5G networks, as well as various 5G-focused publications from governments, regulatory authorities, mobile industry associations and global suppliers over the past six years (2015–2020).

Ambitious goals to incentivise investment in high-speed broadband networks have been set across the European Union, initially in the ‘Digital Agenda for Europe’ and more recently in its ‘Gigabit strategy’. These goals reflect the view of many that there are widespread and significant socio-economic benefits associated with broadband. Our analysis explores the consequence of target setting at a European level, in terms of encouraging investment and picking which technology should be adopted within the context of technological neutrality. We demonstrate that while public policy targets might implicitly favour specific technologies, especially when gigabit targets are defined, the technological choices that occur within individual Member States are shaped by the complex and dynamic interaction between a series of path dependencies that may vary significantly across as well as within Member States. Adopting an ecosystem perspective, we propose a conceptual framework that identifies the key factors associated with technological neutrality and informs a rational decision-making process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","5G; Broadband; EU public policies; Fibre networks; Path dependency; Technological neutrality",""

The standardization process is not intended to screen contributions for the significance of the contribution they make to the standard. Against this background, contribution counts are not a suitable basis for apportioning the value of a standard between different SEP holders. The measure is prone to be easily manipulated.

Though many technological options are proposed in literature, satellite communication has been identified as the only possible solution for the most rural areas, due to its global coverage. However, deploying an end-to-end satellite solution might, in some cases, not be cost-effective. The aim of this study is to give insights into the economic effectiveness of integrating satellite communications into 4G networks in order to connect the most rural areas (also referred to as white areas) in Europe. To this end, this paper proposes a converged solution that combines satellite communication as a backhaul network with 4G as a fronthaul network to bring enhanced broadband connectivity to European rural areas, along with a techno-economic model to analyse the economic viability of this integration. The model is based on a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) model for 5 years, taking into account both capital and operational expenditures, and aims to calculate the TCO as well as the Average Cost Per User (ACPU) for the studied scenarios. We evaluate the suggested model by simulating a hypothetical use case for two scenarios. The first scenario is based on a radio access network connecting to the 4G core network via a satellite link. Results for this scenario show high operational costs. In order to reduce these costs, we propose a second scenario, consisting of caching the popular content on the edge to reduce the traffic carried over the satellite link. This scenario demonstrates a significant operational cost decrease (more than 60%), which also means a significant ACPU decrease. We evaluate the robustness of the results by simulating for a range of population densities, hereby also providing an indication of the economic viability of our proposed solution across a wider range of areas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","4G; Broadband digital divide; Satellite; Techno-economics",""

Notably, the study examines the impacts of technology development through the internet usage, mobile usage and fixed telephone usage on income inequality. Furthermore, we control and further examine the non-linear impacts of institutional quality and human capital on income inequality. We find that the promotion of internet and mobile diffusion appear to be a way of reducing income inequality in the short and the long run. Nevertheless, we find an inverted-U shape relationship between the human capital and the institutional quality with the income inequality, but not for the case of income level. These findings are observed in our full sample and also in two sub-samples respectively composed by 46 low and middle income economies (LMEs) and 41 high income economies (HIEs). Beyond the empirical results supporting the Kuznets Curve hypothesis (KC) for the human capital and institutions, the major contributions of this article is to show that income inequality issue is actually not a matter of income only since diverse socio-economic and technological considerations have to be taken into account if policy makers want to reduce optimally these inequalities. This article offers an extended theoretical framework (inspired by the Kuznets curve hypothesis) to study income inequalities in a societal perspective in which telecommunications (internet, mobile and land phones) are integrated as key components. Our results confirm that internet and mobile use should actually be part of an active economic policy aiming at reducing income inequalities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Development; Human capital; Income inequality; Institutional quality; Internet; Kuznets curve",""

Based on a “top-down” financial model to estimate the costs of fiber deployment, this analysis shows that these four innovations pursued by Google Fiber, and now adopted on a widespread basis by other broadband providers, lower the costs of building residential Gigabit networks, and therefore can improve the prospects for new entry of service providers of residential broadband services. With technology advances pointing to further cost reductions in the cost of Gigabit networks, this analysis elevates the need for more detailed study of ongoing changes in the cost structure of local access networks to better anticipate future prospects for broadband competition. © 2020","Broadband strategy; Fiber network costs; Gigabit broadband; Google fiber; Municipal broadband; Network economics",""

However, while a freeze in investigations is neither possible nor desirable, neither is the maintenance of the current status quo. Comparison between general-purpose ethical codes and military ones concludes that most ethical principles apply to human use of artificial intelligence systems as long as two characteristics are met: that the way algorithms work is understood and that humans retain enough control.

As extensive datasets including the effect of the current COVID-19 pandemic are still unavailable, this study provides an assessment of the role of digitization at the time of SARS in 2003. Results are robust in pointing out that those countries with better broadband connectivity were able to mitigate some of the economic losses incurred by the pandemic. While anecdotal evidence is plentiful even for COVID-19, this study provides rigorous analysis to support that a reliable telecommunications infrastructure and a high level of digitization is crucial to keep the economy running under pandemic conditions. These results provide valuable evidence for the current context of COVID-19, which has resulted in several national lockdowns around the world. In consequence, we believe that the public and private sectors must collaborate and work together to promote the enhancement of the digital ecosystem. In the long run, a suitable regulatory framework seems crucial to stimulate private investments to close the digital supply gap, as well as promoting the digitization of business process and the training of the workforce to acquire digital skills.

Students' behaviour and experience of the library facilities are also influenced by whether the library can accommodate their various needs throughout the study progression. Additionally, the purpose of library usage is much affected by the structure of the library and proximity to other social facilities. The findings also indicate that a workspace with effective and flexible seating solutions contribute to approach behaviour.

Driven by concerns of privacy, national security, surveillance, and cyber terrorism, governments around the world have been erecting barriers in cyberspace through data localization. The extent of data localization varies from free flow of data, to stringent restrictions requiring all data to be stored only within the territorial jurisdiction of the country. Though there are certain legitimate concerns regarding protection of personal data, scholars and liberal economists have long proclaimed that any restrictions on the Internet and associated digital trade will have serious economic consequences. Data localization affects digital trade between consumers and producers of digital services to varying degrees. In this paper, we use agent based modeling to study the properties and behaviours of consumers and producers under varying data localization regimes. An augmented gravity model of trade with iceberg coefficient is incorporated to reflect distance-related costs between producers and consumers. Varying data localization compliance costs are included to reflect the effect of non-tariff barriers of data restrictions. Our extensive simulations indicate that there is often clustering of consumers around local firms in highly restrictive data localization regimes, thus enabling local firms to effectively compete against global multinationals. However, results also indicate that while free cross-border data flow enables intense competition amongst producers, data localization restrictions often limit consumer choice due to its effect on price and quality of services. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based model; Cross-border data flow; Data localization; Data nationalization; Data protection regulation; Gravity model of trade; Iceberg costs; Non-tariff barriers",""

As important as they are likely to be, their implications are still little known. This article's purpose is an attempt to provide a policy space within which to begin fill that void. It presents a non-technical introduction to the concept of quantum mechanics in general, to the unique characteristics of sub-atomic particles, to quantum applications, and to QC and QAI in particular. The development of fully functioning quantum information technologies is in its early stages, but is being pursued aggressively. One of the most salient of these is Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) – a fusion of QC and AI – which some see as potentially threatening. There is little in established telecommunications or information policies to inform our approach to its capabilities. The article notes some of the challenges to development of quantum-based information technologies and considers the scope of global competition to the U.S. in this field, especially from China. It reviews the treatment of “Quantum Information Science” in U.S. policy. It describes the current policy environment and the range of new measures which might be available, if needed, to incorporate QAI into an overall information policy regime. In conclusion the article reviews the debate over adoption of the “precautionary principle” for QAI, an approach to policy when it must deal with weakly understood causes of potentially catastrophic or irreversible events. It sets out the arguments pro and con, and in the absence of an immediate resolution proposes adoption of a policy space in which stakeholders can address their salient concerns, without materially impairing technological progress and commercial viability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Embedded infosphere; Policy space; Precautionary principle; Quantum artificial intelligence; Quantum computing; Quantum information science; Quantum initiative",""

Since 2012, mobile phone penetration has shown nearly linear growth, reaching 83% in 2016. However, this statistic falls to only 46% after correcting for ownership of multiple SIM cards and sharing of mobile phones among multiple users. The determinants of mobile phone ownership in Nigeria are poorly understood, which hinders research that could inform policies capable of increasing mobile phone penetration and eliminating the digital divide. To begin to fill this research gap, we have analyzed socio-economic factors related to mobile phone ownership in the country. We used a logit model and the latest national-level Datafirst ICT dataset (2012) about mobile phone adoption from 1552 individuals. The sample was stratified, clustered, and probability-weighted to make it representative of the situation at the national level. The results suggest that factors such as geographic location and income may not strongly influence mobile phone ownership, in contrast to what was previously thought. Instead, the strongest factors appeared to be education level, informal work, social engagement, type of electricity supply and employment status. Our analysis suggests that to increase mobile phone ownership and close the digital divide, policy makers should target younger adults, provide training in digital literacy specifically for mobile phone use, invest in electricity supply infrastructure, and develop content and applications in non-English languages. These findings may contribute to understanding mobile phone distribution in Nigeria as well as inform implementation of the country's ICT Roadmap 2017–2020 and Vision 2020. © 2019 The Authors","Africa; Digital divide; Mobile phone; Nigeria; Policy implications; Socio-economic factors",""

As such, there is a debate over whether both services are interrelated and constitute a joint product market, which has important implications for the current wave of mergers in the mobile industry and regulation policy. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to provide an empirical analysis of how the consumption of OTT messengers affects demand for text messaging and mobile voice services. We make use of an innovative dataset which includes very detailed information on smartphone usage in Norway and consider a novel approach to address this question which is embedded in the complexity of two-sided markets. Interestingly, our findings suggest that OTT messengers complement demand for traditional mobile telecommunication services for this context. Consequently, both markets are interrelated but do not constitute a joint market from the perspective of competition policy in Norway. Moreover, we find an explanation for why reductions of text messaging usage have been so drastic in some countries and an analogous development for mobile voice is rather unlikely. Finally, our empirical results provide a new perspective on the modelling of consumer utility in communication networks in the theoretical literature. © 2019","Antitrust; Communication behaviour; Competition policy; Market definition; Mature markets; Mobile telecommunication; OTT messengers; Regulation; Technological change",""

This study investigates mIM users' motives in visiting the store and identifies the role of mIM characters in facilitating users' loyalty toward the mIM service provider. To comprehensively understand users' motivations in visiting the offline flagship store, the study conducted a focus group interview and used the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to identify seven key motivations. The empirical findings are drawn from 332 Korean respondents that use the mIM service and have experience in visiting the character flagship store. The study finds that users who actively use mIM services and emoticons are likely to visit the store due to the identified factors. A virtuous cycle of loyalty from online to the offline platform, and vice versa was also found.

While prior research has placed blame squarely on the Federal Election Commission (FEC) for their lack of oversight of digital advertising, this paper demonstrates the way in which the platforms–Facebook in particular–engineered this regulatory failure in the form of capture on this specific issue. An analysis of documents submitted to the FEC demonstrates that Facebook and Google put profit ahead of the public interest in seeking exemptions from disclaimer requirements, refusing to change the size of their advertisements and downplaying the deceptive potential of political ads. Due to partisan gridlock and a lack of technological expertise, the FEC failed to rule decisively on exemptions or agree on alternative means of disclaimers for Facebook and mobile app ads, setting the stage for electoral interference in 2016.

This empirical study is motivated by the use of EHR in many countries as a method of promoting healthcare services. Another incentive for the present study is to look at EHR as a top layer in the Next Generation of Information Infrastructure (NII). EHR is considered an efficiency-enhancing and cost-effective technology. Moreover, the issue of developing the healthcare sector in Egypt has the attention of government policymakers, who have a comprehensive healthcare and social insurance law that will be discussed in the Egyptian Parliament, in the near future. The study highlights the socio-technical approach used in analyzing the EHR as an eHealth application in Egypt. The underlying theoretical framework of this study implicates the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology in the Consumer Context (UTAUT2) model. It also applies an integrated framework of multifaceted perceptions used to explain the expected adoption or behavior of the Egyptian consumer vis-à-vis EHR. The study relies on primary data collected after surveying 559 respondents. Results reveal that determinants of EHR include demographics such as place and gender, but more importantly constructs such as price value, effort expectancy and facilitating conditions are key factors that play a part in the decision made by the Egyptian consumer to adopt EHR technology. Finally, additional insight and recommendations are offered to the policymakers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Egypt; eHealth; eHealth policy; Electronic health records; Healthcare sector; Logistic regression; Next generation of infrastructure; UTAUT2",""

To deliver on this promise of ushering in faster downloads and lower latency, mobile network operators are called upon for substantial investment in network infrastructure. Investors and operators need a clear 5G business case before making such investment. So far, very little research has been published on the topic of the 5G business case. This article studies the impact of different elements driving the business case of a 5G network. The study was performed within 3 boroughs of central London, UK, for the period 2020–2030. 5G-related costs and revenues were calculated to derive the business case. The results show that the business case for a 5G network providing mobile broadband services alone is positive over the time period 2020–2030 but has some risk in the later years of this time period. The business case is also particularly sensitive to assumptions on the revenue uplift and the rate of traffic growth which are inherently challenging to forecast. The sensitivity analysis shows that the return on investment becomes negative if both traffic and costs are significantly higher and revenues increase more slowly than our baseline forecasts. Network sharing helps to substantially improve the business case. Further research is needed to understand the business case on a regional or nationwide basis, and for a network that provides additional services beyond broadband. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","5G; Business case; Costs; Mobile broadband; Revenues",""

First, the plan extended the FGB coverage of rural areas, although with a substantial delay and incompletely, with respect to the ambitious targets of the Digital Agenda for Europe. Second, public consultations have significantly increased the transparency of the market and of the SA intervention, promoting investment and a gradual increase in the efficiency of public procurement. Third, the direct effects of SA on competitive entry appear less pronounced, at least in the static sense. Fourth, the final matching between allocative and dynamic efficiency of SA policy, and its coherence with industrial and innovation policies remain critical, based on the Italian experience: in fact, the persisting digital divide affecting the business-rich areas depicts another relevant instance of partial Government failure. © 2019","Broadband; Italy; Open government data; Policy impact evaluation; State aid control",""

The possibility of performing a regional approach to test the effect of broadband on productivity in an emerging country represents a novelty for the literature. Results suggest that the impact of broadband on productivity is positive although not uniform across regions. On the one hand, it seems to depend on connection quality and network effects. Faster download speed and critical-mass accounting for network externalities in the region enhance the economic impact of broadband. On the other hand, higher productivity gains are estimated for the less developed regions. The fact that the less productive regions in Brazil seem to be benefiting more from broadband may suggest that it can constitute a factor favoring regional convergence in the country. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Broadband; ICT; Productivity",""

However, their ability to use services such as cloud computing, VoIP, media streaming, high-frequency trading, network gaming, video conferencing and telemedicine, are sensitive to the network quality of service (QoS). We examine the effects of pro-competition regulation on Internet QoS - a measure of digital divide - using 23 indicators of competition from a panel of 160 countries covering 2008–2016. We find that pro-competition regulations had a stronger positive effect on QoS in developed countries compared to developing ones. A one-point increase in the pro-competition score increases QoS, measured as average connection speed, by at least 200 kbps in developed countries. Our results control for supply and demand factors, as well as country-fixed effects. The results are also robust to different measures of average connection speed. We attribute this variation to difficulties in the contracting environment in developed and developing countries, consistent with Levy and Spiller (1996). Countries with better institutional endowments – associated with developed economies - are better able to design and enforce complex regulatory contracts compared to developing countries. Ironically, this means that more pro-competition rules on paper will not necessarily narrow the digital divide between developed and developing countries and that there is a need to consider minimum quality standards as a means to effect improved Internet QoS. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Competition; Digital divide; Internet; Quality of service; Regulation",""

Due to, among other factors, the nature of its network externalities, the market seems to be gradually shifting to a market with oligopolistic characteristics in which the services are provided by a limited number of big-name firms.

For this project, the library space was reconstructed such that a corner became a climbing wall on which children could create words by following varied paths up the wall's letter-filled surface. Seating was transformed into large movable “Tangram”-type pieces and a stage, complete with magnetic words, invited children to create stories on the wall and complete story-related activities through socio-dramatic play.

Non-parametric methods and factor analysis are used to evaluate the gender similarities and differences. Latent structures show no relevant differences by gender in perceptions (BI and SE), but different patterns are found in knowledge (KN) regarding the acquisition of the key information competencies. To overcome possible stereotypes and contribute to the construction of an all-inclusive perspective that fosters an awareness of the value of equality, it is necessary to incorporate the gender perspective in information and knowledge management studies.

Social media platforms enable the rapid spread of such misinformation and also make evaluating the credibility of online information more difficult. Since college students are frequent users of social media, they are particularly likely to be exposed to fake news. A survey was conducted with 63 undergraduate students in which they identified and evaluated examples of both fake and real news stories and reported their associated information behaviors. Results showed correlations between accurate identification of fake news stories and specific critical evaluation behaviors and strategies. However, students were unable to accurately evaluate their own skills, and their willingness to share fake news stories on social media was not related to accurate identifications or evaluations of trustworthiness. This study contributes to the understanding of not just how accurately students evaluate fake news stories, but of the specific information-seeking behaviors and critical evaluation strategies that are associated with accurate identifications and evaluations and with willingness to share news stories on social media.

The study sought to develop relations between RJC and situational relevance (SR) via four perceived values, epistemic value, functional value, conditional value, and social value, by introducing multi-factors perceived value (PV) theory and structural equation modeling (SEM). The study developed a RJC model basing on multi-factors PV and derived seven hypotheses to be verified. The data of the use of RJC and self-estimation of PVs from 453 people who were all participants of a national data sharing competition were collected by questionnaire, and then were verified and analyzed by SEM to test the hypotheses. The results verify the effectiveness of four PVs on SR with different levels. Meanwhile, it also suggests that RJC can function as the measurements of PVs and reduce RJC as well.

Second, the way the Council of the EU (hereafter “the Council”) is lobbied at EU level is unclear because of lack of transparency in the Council. Third, radio spectrum policy issues require niche expertise to be addressed because of high degree of complexity. Fourth, radio spectrum policy issues are characterised by low degree of salience as they are too technical for the wider public. Although centred on the EU context, the issues raised in this study, such as lack of transparency and civil society underrepresentation, are not unique to the EU system.

However, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have scarce time and resources for experimenting with their BMs and implementing new strategies. This paper examines whether SMEs that undergo digital transformation perform better if they allocate more resources for BM experimentation and engage more in strategy implementation. An empirical study was conducted on 321 European SMEs that actively use social media, big data, and information technology to innovate their BMs. Furthermore, structural equation modelling showed positive overall firm performance effects of more resource allocation to BM experimentation and more engagement in practices of strategy implementation. These effects were mediated by BM experimentation practices and company innovativeness. Moreover, fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) revealed the presence of equifinality by identifying different configurations in which these antecedent conditions affect overall firm overall performance. The results of two methodological approaches showed that SMEs may take different routes to improve their performance when digital transformation is changing their BM.

Based on the findings, a unified framework about immigrants, their information needs, sources to satisfy those needs, and library information services is, therefore, proposed. This framework may provide guidance for libraries and other information service agencies to better develop services and information systems for immigrants. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","",""

The employed economic growth dynamics are Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, real GDP and GDP per capita while ICT is measured by mobile phone penetration and internet penetration. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalised Method of Moments. The study finds that both internet penetration and mobile phone penetration overwhelmingly modulate FDI to induce overall positive net effects on all three economic growth dynamics. Moreover, the positive net effects are consistently more apparent in internet-centric regressions compared to “mobile phone”-oriented specifications. In the light of negative interactive effects, net effects are decomposed to provide thresholds at which ICT policy variables should be complemented with other policy initiatives in order to engender favourable outcomes on economic growth dynamics.

From a regulator's perspective, disruptive operators can increase competitive rivalry in markets dominated by a handful of large companies, thereby allowing consumers to obtain more benefits in terms of price and quality. Largely overlooked in this discussion has been the impact that the specific identity, complementary assets of operators, and their strategies have on the marketplace dynamics. In this paper we explore the impact that one such operator – Free Mobile – has had on the French mobile telecommunications market. Drawing on a wide range of secondary sources, our analysis finds that the entry and subsequent growth of Free Mobile has had a complex and multi-faceted impact on the market. Their growth has been at the expense of the other three mobile network operators active in the French market, while their innovative business model, which enables it to compete on the basis of low costs, has been copied by its rivals. The specific characteristics of Free Mobile and of its strategy have contributed to a significantly alteration to how competition occurs in this market. This, in turn, triggers a strong incentive for restructuring, which is actually restrained by regulatory concerns. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Competition; Disruption; Entry; France; Free mobile; Mobile telecommunications",""

As more people get connected to telecommunication networks and competition becomes increasingly fierce, it becomes essential to revamp institutions that ensure consumer protection in the telecommunication markets. This paper analyses the current status of institutions that protect consumers in the telecommunications sector in five African countries from the perspective of three pillars of sound institutional design. The findings indicate that while all cases analysed herein have some form of institution that upholds consumer protection, in most cases, such protection is limited to mobile communications. Furthermore, in most cases, there are only general sanction provisions that are either too weak to bind service providers or that leave overly discretionary powers to regulatory agencies, which can lead to corrupt practices, hence weakening consumer protection.

This article analyses the factors that have contributed to the deployment of these fibre networks by both the incumbent and the alternative operators that previously relied on the Local Loop Unbundling (LLU) of copper cables. An investment-friendly regulatory framework, which did not mandate access to the optical loops, and a telecommunications market comprised of dissimilar actors in the fixed and mobile segments, have been key to the deployment of FTTP networks in Spain. Additionally, based on historical coverage data, we test retrospectively, the sensitivity of geographic market segmentation to the time of the analysis and criteria for potential NGA competition. As per the analysis, the unregulated area where facility-based competition may be expected range between 23% and 61% of the premises upon the case. We discuss the implications of having mandated a Virtual Unbundled Local Access (VULA) to New Generation Access (NGA) infrastructure in 2013, examining the most likely operators' strategies.

However, no prior research has investigated the value of public library services for children. Specifically, earlier studies evaluated the value of public libraries as a whole, without considering library services for different stakeholders. The fact that children are not autonomous economic agents is another problem to address. These barriers can be overcome by using the contingent valuation method with parents/caregivers as the subjects queried and children used as the objects in this study. Thus, the economic value of library services for children can be obtained to support managerial decisions on services specifically designed for children. More precisely, this study is unique in that it develops a contingent valuation methodology for estimating the value of children's library services based on adults' willingness to allocate a proportion of municipal budgets. Both users and non-users were surveyed to verify the proposed methodology empirically. The results show that the perceived effectiveness (ratio between perceived benefits and costs) of children's library services is 11.2 (11.2 units of benefits for each unit invested) in Czech public libraries compared with 4.3 for a library as a whole. This finding confirms the essential role of children's library services, implying that public libraries should offer a broader selection of children's books and other services. The study also shows that the value of children's library services depends on the age, education and economic structure of the adults queried. In addition, their satisfaction with library services is another important determinant, indicating that public libraries can influence the perceived benefits of children's library services. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","",""

To analyse these processes, the paper links value creation (i.e. activities focusing on innovation challenges)to value capture (i.e. activities referring to actual individual firm-level profit generation)in smart city initiatives. Based on an in-depth survey of the literature, the purpose of the paper is to better understand how processes of internal alignment foster value creation and value capture during the growth of smart city initiatives.

Data were collected through semistructured interviews and analyzed through open, axial and selective coding. The findings showed that ELIS in coping with daily hassles is a multidimensional phenomenon that is affected by individuals' characteristics and sociocultural norms and values. Three main categories emerged as determinants of ELIS, namely normative status of the daily hassles, normative status of the information resources, and the individual's characteristics. Two main categories emerged as dimensions of ELIS which were type and strategy of action.

One of the important characteristics of mobile games is that their lifetime is remarkably short compared with those of PC or console games, and downloads of most games peak during the early period of the service. Acquiring as many users as possible immediately after the launch and retaining these users therefore becomes very important for the successful performance of mobile games. This study aims to identify the determinants of mobile game success during different periods after the launch by comparing the first week's performance with the first 4 weeks' performance using a multiple regression analysis with mobile game application downloads from Google Play and estimated sales revenue as performance indicators. The predictors were classified on the basis of the pre- and postlaunch phases, and developer/publisher and third-party factors. A key finding is that for both revenue and downloads, TV advertising and the number of online videos have strong impacts on both the first week and 4 weeks' performance. In addition, preregistration during the prelaunch stage is effective for increasing both revenue and downloads in a relatively short time. Online videos uploaded by the users during the postlaunch phase may help to maintain long-term revenue. Although awareness of IP and name value of publishers are significant for short-term downloads, the effect diminishes after a month, which might imply that there could be an opportunity for small- and medium-sized companies to invest in media and obtain mobile platform advantages in the long run. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Game downloads; Game revenue; Mobile game industry; Regression analysis",""

The Internet was the students' primary information source, since using Google was a daily lifestyle habit while the library was totally new and unfamiliar territory. Comparison of the students' information search processes (ISPs) with Kuhlthau's ISP diagram revealed that the students searching was idiosyncratic and unpredictable, and they only adopted systematic search protocols when these were imposed on them. Chatman's theory of information poverty was useful as it revealed that the students' perception of information deprivation cut across all socio-economic groups. © 2019","",""

We also analyze how policy shaped the ways in which different actors were included and allowed to participate in the implementation process. We show that enhancing the mainstream criteria like the rate of ICT adoption and diffusion, do not necessarily mean that policy will reap the expected benefits. From this standpoint, we propose that the focus of debate in policy making and defining policy objectives should move beyond setting objectives exclusively adopted from global discourse to also considering local issues and concerns. In such conditions, there will be less resistance to the government plans and fewer social challenges. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Developing countries; EFT-POS system; Global discourse; Iran; Local view; Policy making",""

However, contrary to optimistic expectations for future market growth, the smart home market has appeared to hit a roadblock and remains at an early market stage. This study attempts to identify the possible barriers that consumers perceive when they are introduced to smart home services. Based on the resistance theory and perceived risk model, we investigate the relationship between perceived risk and resistance to smart home services, using technological uncertainty and service intangibility as the antecedents of perceived risk. Dividing perceived risk into four dimensions—performance risk, financial risk, privacy risk, and psychological risk—the empirical results show that these four risk types are affected by technology uncertainty and service intangibility, and the perceived risks, except for financial risk, have positive effects on the resistance to smart home services. When the survey respondents are divided into two types, postponers and rejecters, the result of postponers is similar with that of total sample, except that privacy risk is unimportant to postponers, and the result of rejecter cannot satisfy the recommended model fit. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Barriers; Internet of things; Perceived risk; Resistance; Smart home; Uncertainty",""

The productivity of main services of public libraries was studied for the year 2016 in comparison with the year 2012. On average, small as well as large libraries exhibit a statistically significant decline in productivity. The average value of the MI of small libraries is 1.29.

E-government reforms helped Korea cut domestic corruption, and research has established a clear causal relationship between ICT, E-government, and lower corruption. GMM dynamic panel data analysis indicates, however, that Korean ICT aid has in fact exacerbated corruption in recipient nations. ICT ODA from Canada and the U.K., the second and third largest national donors, however, successfully reduced recipient corruption levels. Why? The characteristics of recipients targeted by each respective donor and key differences in national ODA program goals and management systems explain the results. Tobit regressions reveal that economic and security motives led Korea to favor recipients that were poorer and more authoritarian with inferior governance institutions, traits which fixed and random effect regressions show lower E-governments effectiveness against corruption. Canada and the U.K. primarily succeeded by designating good governance as a core ODA goal and by pioneering Results Based Management systems to realize program objectives. They established clear goals, linked them to quantifiable indicators, independently evaluated the results and transparently released that information to the public. Good governance was not at the center of the Korean aid program which failed to establish clear targets, credibly measure results or release information, providing fertile ground for graft, like the Choi Soon-shil scandal, to infect the program. To improve ICT ODA effectiveness against corruption, therefore, Korea must elevate good governance as a core aid objective, accelerate introduction of RBM reforms to increase effectiveness, and direct more aid to recipients with greater civil liberties in which leaders are motivated to effectively employ ICT ODA against corruption. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","",""

Our data cover a period of time that saw the introduction of many new and notable sites and new devices on which to access them. In our analysis, we assess “how” households supply their attention along various dimensions, such as their concentration of attention across the universe of sites and the amount of attention expenditure per domain visit. Remarkably, we find no change in “how” households allocated their attention despite drastically changing where they allocated it. Moreover, conditional on total attention expenditure, demographics entirely fail to predict our key measures of attention allocation decisions.

The main reason for comparing the most and the least developed countries to measure the effects of digitalization is to have an insight of whether such effects depend on the levels of development of the country. New technologies in Sub Saharan Africa are assumed to have played significant roles in economic activity, including accessibility of communications, which was impeded by poor infrastructure, accommodation of the poor majority who were initially financially excluded from mobile banking and participation of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in e-commerce. On the other hand, due to the effects of digitalization, least developed countries in SSA have been facing a premature deindustrialization. This study employs a panel dataset consisting of 11 years from 2006 to 2016 for 41 SSA and 33 OECD economies and we use the generalized linear methods of moments (GMM) estimators. The results show that digitalization has a positive contribution to economic growth in both groups of countries. The effect of broadband internet is minimal for SSA compared to OECD countries, whereas the impact of mobile telecommunications is higher in SSA compared to the OECD counterpart. These results are particularly interesting as less advanced technologies create more opportunities in the least developed countries since there is more space for improvement. With respect to policy implications, this study recommends that SSA governments should invest more in ICT along with other infrastructures, so as to benefit from digitalization and to realize significant economic growth. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Digitalization; Economic growth; Generalized methods of moments; Sub Saharan Africa",""

While many in the UK already benefit from the provision of broadband, some, especially those located in more rural and remote areas, do not – they may not be able to access the Internet and when they do, their connection and consumer experience may be poor. After trying to resolve this through a stream of different initiatives, the UK government announced a broadband universal service obligation (USO) of 10 Mbps in late 2015. Ofcom, the telecommunications regulator, launched a consultation in April 2016 and sought the views of interested parties. The consultation attracted considerable interest, but after the submissions from orchestrated campaigns are discounted just over 100 responses remain. But who contributed and what did they say? To explore these two questions, this paper adopts a qualitative approach, using NVIVO, to analyse the responses to the consultation. We show that contributions were highly diverse, reflecting both the complexity of the issue as well as its politicised nature. A lack of agreement among the responses is revealed and divergent views on key issues like the appropriateness of 10 Mbps, whether this should change, how it should be funded or what technologies should be used exist. In this paper, we provide a critical discussion of and derive implications for the broadband USO. We tentatively conclude that those in rural and remote areas that the USO intends to help are caught between two countervailing forces – speed and cost deployment – that interact to ensure that whatever resolution to provide broadband access, some will likely be unhappy. © 2019","Broadband; Consultation; Internet access; UK; Universal service",""

We find that an average telecommuter's surplus in terms of costs saved, including opportunity cost ranges from $8820 to $23964 per annum per telecommuter, depending on the number of days telecommuted per week for home and primary residence dwelling type. The social net benefits of telecommuting differ from its private net benefit (the focus of our paper) since the former includes both positive and negative externalities associated with telecommuting such as reduced traffic congestion, reduced probability of road accidents, as well as some workers shirking their duties (a negative impact). We leave this for future work. © 2018 The Authors","Economics of telecommuting; Opportunity cost of commuting; Telecommuting surplus; Teleworking",""

Identifying effective factors on librarians' knowledge sharing behavior helps us to understand and improve the situation. Organizational factors are one group of these factors. The effect of organizational climate, employees' motivational drives, and leadership empowerment on the subjective norms, attitude, intention, and knowledge sharing behavior among librarians in public libraries in Iran was studied. A conceptual model was designed in light of the Theory of Reasoned Action. Ten hypotheses were formulated. Data were collected by using a questionnaire and were analyzed using structural equations models. The findings showed that constructive organizational climate and positive motivational drives in public libraries, as well as personal and organizational knowledge sources strengthened by the librarians' ability of leadership have a positive and significant effect on subjective norms, attitude, intention, and knowledge sharing behavior. Such conditions facilitate the process of knowledge sharing in public library environments. Moreover, the study highlights the effect of the librarians' leadership empowerment on their attitude to knowledge sharing behavior by motivational drives. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","",""

However, those comparisons have become more complicated because of the escalation in service usage and telecommunications expenditures spurred by the proliferation of smartphones and broadband LTE wireless internet service networks. The basket-based methodologies that have been widely used for international price comparisons are also limited—first, because the baskets for comparison may not be representative of actual service usage patterns in some countries; second, because they are difficult to apply to highly differentiated service plans due to the significant increase in wireless internet service usage and widely used plans with unlimited voice call service and SMS/MMS; and third, because they cannot consider the quality of service, such as upload and download speed in various service environments, at all. As an alternative, this paper proposes a hedonic pricing model that accounts for service quality and its variation in potentially disruptive environments, as well as fixed charge for a mobile phone additional to the price of service plans. The model was used to derive quality-adjusted price indices of mobile telecommunications services for twelve cities in ten countries with broadband LTE wireless internet service. The empirical results confirmed that the price index of each city varied significantly across the specifications,—both within the United States and internationally—depending on whether the model was constructed to reflect service quality and its variation on roads, in buildings, and in subways. The price index of each city also varied depending on whether the subsidized price of a mobile phone was considered part of the monthly price of a service plan. These results have important implications for policymakers seeking to understand the ultimate level of mobile telecommunication service prices for their country in a global context. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Hedonic pricing model; Mobile telecommunications services; Quality-adjusted price index",""

As participation in society becomes largely dependent on use of internet-enabled technologies, internet non-users may seek alternative ways of using the internet. Proxy internet use (PIU), where internet non-users ask internet users to perform online activities on their behalf, is a strategy for obtaining (indirect) internet access. This study examines factors for engagement in PIU, focusing specifically on how non-users’ reasons for disengagement relate to their engagement in PIU. The results from multivariate analyses of survey data from a nation-wide representative sample show that 47% of internet non-users in Slovenia who report having someone available for PIU in fact engage in PIU. In analysing four types of reasons for internet non-use—those related to interest, access, costs and skills—the results show that access issues are negatively related to engagement in PIU. Conversely, reasons related to skills issues are positively related to engagement in PIU. Considering that access to online services through PIU offers an important degree of digital inclusion, the results of this study have important policy implications. Policy initiatives tackling digital inequalities should be sensible to access and skills issues resulting in disengagement. For example, policies directed at providing and maintaining internet access at a household level may result in non-users’ increased opportunities for PIU. In contrast, skills policies should be directed at creating opportunities for informal and person-centred learning of digital skills, considering that non-users who are more aware of their deficiency in skills might be more aware of online opportunities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Digital inclusion; Digital skills; Indirect internet access; Internet non-use; Proxy internet use; Reasons for internet non-use",""

Studying the diffusion of mobile communications in African countries by integrating them into panels of developing countries is problematic. This approach is likely to mask the intrinsic differences as concerns the diffusion process. This survey shows, through the estimation of an S-shaped growth curve, that the Logistic model best describes the diffusion of mobile phone technology in Cameroon. Income, openness to competition and the use of SMS are key forces driving this diffusion. Forecasts indicate an increase of almost 70% in the demand by 2026 as far as mobile phone use in Cameroon is concerned. This implies not only an improvement in operators' and State's revenues, but also, the need to invest in infrastructures. Our recommendation therefore calls for a greater liberalization of the mobile phone market in Cameroon. In addition, given the complementary relationship between the core and the mobile networks, infrastructural investments are also needed in both sectors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Access subsidies; Competition; Mobile telephone technology; Regulation; Technological diffusion",""

This was expected to enhance the performance of the mobile telecommunications industry in the accession countries and in turn to consolidate the highly fragmented European mobile telecoms market to finally reach the single market goal. However, the significant differences between mobile telecommunication performances from one country to another in the enlarged European area raise the issue of how optimal and durable the EU-level reforms have been. We use dynamic quantile regression methods to estimate the effects of mobile telecommunication reforms on the providers' performance in the EU enlargement context. This approach allows uncovering potential asymmetric effects of telecom reforms policy by letting the parameters of regressions vary across the conditional distribution of the sector's performance indicators. Using annual data from on 32 European countries from 1993 to 2011, we document asymmetrical responses to the reforms depending on the conditioning quantile at which they are calculated. Our results show that the effects of the generic and imposed European reforms are notably beneficial and larger for players in developed European countries characterized initially by real and higher degree of the reforms implementation. Accordingly, the success and durability of European reforms, especially in the new CEE member states, which often fail to comply with the pace of the reforms' adoption of industrialized European countries, is not guaranteed when countries specifications are not sufficiently taken into account. A final appealing result regarding the regress of the reform-performance relationship in the mobile markets after enlargement even for western countries attract attention on revising the Europe's current approach to telecoms regulation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","European countries; Mobile telecommunications; Quantile regression; System GMM; Telecom reforms",""

First, this study finds that appropriate telework hours increase labor productivity, but when telework hours are too long, telework decreases labor productivity. Second, telework increases life satisfaction, and life satisfaction improves labor productivity. However, telework increases the stress of balancing work and domestic chores, contrary to Japanese governmental expectations, and the stress decreases life satisfaction. The stress, fortunately, does not directly reduce labor productivity. Although telework increases happiness and work satisfaction, these factors do not influence labor productivity. Third, this study clarifies that telework is more efficient for improving labor productivity if workers commute more than 1 h or commute by trains or buses that are usually very crowded during rush hours in Japan. Finally, the effect of telework for workers who have a greater number of potential trivial duties is insignificantly larger. Supervisors and colleagues often ask others to perform trivial, extra tasks without regard for schedules. Telework may help workers avoid such trivial duties and increase labor productivity. However, the importance of trivial duties is also demonstrated in this study. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Commuting; Interruption at work; Labor productivity; Life satisfaction; Stress of balancing work and domestic chores; Telework",""

Nevertheless, their contribution to broadband development has varied significantly over time. In the late 1990s, both local and national utilities in the European Union (EU) engaged in the provision of broadband networks, but only few of them managed to establish themselves as major broadband providers. More recently, new projects involving national utilities have been announced in several EU countries, opening new scenarios for utilities’ contribution to Next Generation Access (NGA) development. This paper identifies and explores the factors affecting the entry and the success of utilities in the EU broadband market, through the comparison of four case studies from four EU countries (Germany, Italy, Sweden and the UK). The evolution of utility involvement in the EU broadband markets is assessed against the interaction of market, technology and policy factors, focusing on the impact of policy and regulatory measures. As a result, this paper provides fruitful insights into the relevance and effectiveness of public interventions in broadband markets. Across the four case studies, public support and public ownership emerged as the main drivers for the involvement of utilities in EU broadband markets, with regulatory measures and economies of scope exerting a limited and decreasing influence. However, the contribution of utilities has varied significantly across the cases studied, reflecting the different approaches taken at national and local level to support broadband development, in spite of the common regulatory framework. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Broadband investment; Broadband policy; Open-access networks; Utility providers",""

Based on a database with broadband initiatives, interviews with stakeholders, focus groups and document analysis, it analyzes how rural broadband initiatives and regional governments interact in their ventures to provide superfast broadband to rural communities. Essential in this is that in the Dutch participation society concept, citizens’ initiatives are seen as an important actor to deal with failing service delivery by market players in rural areas. The relation between regional governments and citizens’ initiatives, however, is troublesome, resulting in inadequate policies. Key findings are that even when governments come up with supportive policies for citizens’ initiatives, initiatives still experience governmental efforts as constraining factors. Regional governments apply ‘old style’ governance and construct generic policy instruments, forcing initiatives to put a lot of effort in complying with generic policy requirements or political goals. Overall, solving a national market problem at the regional level proves to be problematic. More national guidance is needed to solve the rural broadband gap. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Participation society; Regional policy; Regulation; Rural broadband; The Netherlands",""

It plays a valuable role and is dedicated mainly to the development and growth of society. Analyzing a library from the perspective of a network of relations and ties, which exist between social and technical network nodes, contributes to a more nuanced assessment of effectiveness. Building on social network analysis and going beyond human relations in a library, this study examines perceptions related to knowledge and skills, resources, and tasks, identified through a survey conducted at the university library in Warsaw. Overall, the analyzed library is characterized by redundancy and congruence of knowledge, resources, and tasks required at the library (organizational) level and at the particular node (employee) level. Analyzing the network efficiency of a library is a new and valuable research design which uses a unique network measurement that should attract more interest in the future. This form of analysis gives managers the tools to dynamize relations and understand the flow, use, and sharing of resources or knowledge within a library context.

Achieving Europe's broadband access objectives will require large scale investment in next generation broadband networks, and it is imperative that an appropriate investment climate is created to encourage fibre network rollout. This study considers whether and how competition in the DSL market affects the incentives of operators to invest in the deployment of high-end fibre optic networks. Most earlier research on the drivers of investment in broadband technology has focused on the effect of mandatory access policies, such as local loop unbundling, or competing infrastructures. We posit that competition in the DSL sector may also influence fibre penetration, possibly to a considerable extent. We find that the relationship between service-based competition and fibre penetration is non-linear: a lack of or severe DSL competition is correlated with a negative effect on fibre penetration, but if a moderate degree of competition is already present in the market, more service-based competition may positively influence fibre penetration. The scale of these effects however varies with the openness of the DSL market: operators’ incentives to invest in fibre appear to be more sensitive to changes in DSL competition if there is extensive local loop unbundling. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","",""

The European Union (EU) is especially interested in the promotion of CBeC because it is an important tool in its strategy to achieve the Digital Single Market in Europe. In this paper official data is used from a representative survey of 16,209 individuals on ICT usage by households and individuals that was carried out in Spain by the National Institute of Statistics (INE) for the year 2016. Using a standard neoclassical utility maximization framework, and logistic regression techniques, the results show that being a male is positively related to the probability of practicing CBeC. Education is positively and significantly related to the probability of being involved in CBeC with EU countries. Computer and Internet Skills are significant and positive factors in explaining CBeC (either with EU countries or with the rest of the world). The variable “how often the consumer sees other customer reviews before buying online”, has a positive effect. Foreign nationality also increases the likelihood of using CBeC. To promote CBeC in Spain measures towards developing digital skills, Internet trust and use of online information reviews of goods and services are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cross-border e-commerce; Customer reviews; Digital skills; Domestic e-commerce; Logistic model; Online opinion seeker",""

What is meant by DD are the differences in the levels of digital development of the enterprises; being the digital development the degree of adoption and use of ICTs and e-commerce by the firms. The aim of this piece of work is to characterise and measure the DD in the Spanish regions and those in the countries of the European Union based on the data of their enterprises with more than 10 employees which have used ICTs. The methodology is developed in the following stages: 1) Construction of a synthetic index of digital development (Enterprise Digital Development Index –EDDI-) for countries in the EU and Spanish regions. The production of this index is carried out based on the factors obtained with the factor analysis (FA) with the aim of identifying the key variables which define the different EDDI components. These variables come from the “Community survey on ICT usage and e-commerce in enterprises” of Eurostat. 2) Classification of Spanish regions into the groups of European countries with a similar level of EDDI components based on the discriminant analysis. Those groups are previously obtained by using cluster analysis. And 3) Comparative analysis of the DD between the Spanish regions and those in countries of the EU based on EDDI components and the identified groups. The study provides a synthetic index (EDDI) at European scale comprising 3 dimensions which permits obtaining: i) a ranking from more to less digital development of countries and regions permitting the measurement of the DD among them is established; and ii) a typology of European countries and Spanish regions is defined according to the 3 dimensions of EDDI. The main results of this piece of work show that the Spanish regions at enterprise level: i) are in a medium or higher level of digital development than their European counterparts, presenting, furthermore, a lower DD between them in relation to what happens in European countries; ii) stand out for having a higher digital inclusion than European countries in the ICTs related to infrastructures of internet access and for the interaction with the public authorities; and iii) have a digital development deficit in the integration of ICTs for e-commerce. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Digital divide (DD); Enterprise; European Union; Information and communication technology (ICT); Multivariate analysis; Spanish regions",""

The reason for this is that market power in network provision is thought to be extended into the applications market(s). More recently however, proposed mergers have been between telecommunications and media distribution firms, both of whom have some degree of market power, already sell their own services in bundles, and who may or may not have been offering combined bundles already via contractual agreements. Examples include Sky/Vodafone in New Zealand, and Time Warner/AT&T in the United States as well as Vodafone/Unitymedia in Germany and Media Capital/Altice in Portugal. These complex proposed arrangements pose challenges to competition authorities, whose legal and procedural rules and precedents, especially those defining the relevant markets affected by the merger or vertical integration activity, have been developed from the analysis of simpler cases. These precedents may not be sufficient to analyse current cases, characterized by multiple products catering to heterogeneous consumer preferences, and consumers are not constrained to buying only one variant of the products in each of the upstream and downstream markets. We illustrate the challenges by way of a case study of the proposed merger between Sky and Vodafone, declined by the New Zealand Commerce Commission in February 2017. Limitations in existing market definition processes and the evaluation of market power where bundling already occurs risk overlooking complex demand-side interactions that influence the profitability and efficiency of various structural and contractual strategic choices. We propose that classic merger and antitrust analysis based on econometric cost-benefit analysis can be augmented by using simulation and numerical analysis of a range of bundle offers expected to be relevant in decision-making. We develop a simple model and use it to illustrate how it may be used to inform broadband and content mergers, and other complex antitrust cases, such the assessment of the effects of two-sided markets and firm pricing decisions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","",""

We apply both parametric and nonparametric econometric techniques to study the distribution dynamics of telecom services across the states. Further, we employ the generalised method of moment (GMM) to examine the determinants of telecommunications services in India. Our results indicate that the interstate gap in telecommunications services has been declining over time and there is a tendency for convergence in teledensity towards the national average. The regression analysis suggests that per capita income and network externality are significant determinants of teledensity across states in India. Furthermore, literacy rate and relative size of the service sector are independently significant predictors of teledensity. If we consider rural and urban areas separately, there are some important differences. For example, while the interstate gaps in telecom services in rural areas seem to have declined, there is little evidence of such a tendency in urban areas. However, the regression results with respect to the importance of per capita income and network externality for telecom services are robust to the rural-urban divide and to the inclusion of additional explanatory variables.

One set of estimates claims that the royalty stack is on the order of 20–40 percent of the value of the average phone. In order to assess this claim, we estimate the average cumulative royalty yield—the sum total of patent royalty payments earned by licensors, divided by the total value of mobile phones shipped— in the world mobile phone industry between 2007 and 2016. We “follow the money” and identify, with varying accuracy, 39 potential licensors in the smartphone value chain. We find that, of these, only 29 charged royalties in 2016, running from a low of $1.6 million to a high of $7.7 billion, summing to $14.2 billion in total, which compares with $425.1 billion in mobile phone sales. The average cumulative royalty yield in 2016 was 3.3 percent or $7.20 per phone. If we restrict this only to smartphones, the result would be $9.60 per phone, roughly 3.4 percent of the average selling price. A sensitivity analysis shows that even under a very restrictive set of assumptions, the average cumulative royalty yield on a smartphone would not exceed 5.6 percent. © 2018 The Authors","",""

In the tension between information and privacy, “the right to be forgotten” is not an appropriate solution. Such a micro, individual-based answer puts the burden of protection on each person instead of on external entities that can abuse such knowledge. The personal responsibility to delete personal data is challenging because of the leakage of data that happens through the connections we have with others, many of whom do not share the same privacy preferences. We show that effective deletion is almost impossible (the eternity effect), and is unfair due to the resource burden it entails when users try to achieve it, while at the same time ensuring the potential benefits we can derive in the future from having personal information online. In addition, deletion requests can negatively affect other people who are in the same location and time frame and may not want to have their information deleted. Collectively, we argue also that society is worse off because these circumstances lead people to construct sanitized personas while perpetuating a culture of distrust. Given that the harm is real, we describe technology, societal norms, and the implementation of an anti-discrimination directive for the right to a personal life, and we provide evidence on how anti-discrimination efforts in the past have succeeded when legislation leads to the development of infrastructures that help to enforce them.

Consequently, the cost, coverage and rollout implications of 5G networks across Britain are explored by extrapolating 4G LTE and LTE-Advanced characteristics for the period 2020–2030. We focus on ubiquitous ultrafast broadband of 50 Mbps and test the impact of annual capital intensity, infrastructure sharing and reducing the end-user speed in rural areas to either 10 or 30 Mbps. For the business-as-usual scenario we find that 90% of the population is covered with 5G by 2027, but coverage is unlikely to reach the final 10% due to exponentially increasing costs. Moreover, varying annual capital intensity or deploying a shared small cell network can greatly influence the time taken to reach the 90% threshold, with these changes mostly benefiting rural areas. Importantly, simply by integrating new and existing spectrum, a network capable of achieving 10 Mbps per rural user is possible, which is comparable to the UK's current fixed broadband Universal Service Obligation.

Worldwide and particularly in the European Union (EU), current regulatory frameworks for zero-rating arrangements (ZRA) imply that regulators have to examine on a case-by-case basis whether they prohibit a concrete ZRA or impose restrictions. Such conditions are set because regulators believe that a ZRA runs counter to the interests of end customers or application providers or impedes effective competition between application and Internet service providers. Thus, it is necessary to clarify which case features ought to be inspected in such zero-rating assessments and which feature levels speak against or in favor of regulatory measures linked to ZRA. The present article identifies nine design features of ZRA, three characteristics of customer groups targeted by such offers and three background characteristics of the markets for Internet access services and applications which are of special importance in decisions concerning the need to regulate (to abstain from regulating) zero-rating practices of mobile network operators. The analysis shows that in many instances interests of end customers, application providers as well as of politicians seeking to promote the competitive dynamics on mobile Internet access service and application markets are best served if regulatory authorities tolerate ZRA and control for potential harmful effects after their market launch. Moreover, the study reveals that empirical research on customer reactions to ZRA is urgently required. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Application providers; Data service pricing; Internet access service; Mobile network operators; Network neutrality; Use-dependent/-independent tariffs; Zero-rating",""

The formulation and implementation of the universal service policy in Vietnam were mainly concentrated on action at levels 2 and 3 (formal and informal institutional arrangement, and formal institutional environment). The paper recommends that nations favouring a top-down approach not based on a market-oriented regime should deregulate and emphasize the role of provincial governments as well as encourage private sectors/social organizations and rural users to be more involved in the formulation and implementation of universal service policies. Moreover, the government should set up and force the contractual relations between governmental entities and telecom providers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Institution factors; Policy; Rural areas; Telecommunications; Universal service; Vietnam",""

Therefore, several studies have analyzed how MNO customers who gave a termination announcement differ from individuals who did not communicate this message. However, no work has examined such differences among subscribers who recently switched to another tariff of their MNO. Therefore, this paper explores socio-demographic, service consumption and tariff change differences between contract cancellation “announcers” and “non-announcers” in a sample of 1810 postpaid customers who had changed their rate plan not long ago. Cancellation announcers were more likely to be males who decreased their mobile voice consumption after their tariff switch, had already attempted to churn in the past, had moved from an unmetered to a metered rate type, paid higher monthly bill amounts and received no discounts on their current rate plan that was introduced on the market some time ago. Among subscribers who gave a termination notice, early (late) cancellation announcers were more likely to be older (younger) customers with a growing (shrinking) SMS consumption after their tariff switch, had not attempted (had already tried) to leave their current MNO in the past, and were in a rate plan that was (not) recently introduced.

The new model classifies e-Government development into four stages: “Bureaucratic model” “Information management model” “Participatory model” and “Governance model”. This paper also attempted to apply this model to e-government practices in Korea on the flow of time. E-government in Korea has mainly shown features of one distinct type at a time among four stages, as so far explained above. In this case, the former stage developed to the next level after going through the process of maturation in advancement of ICT and social maturity and political stability. This paper defined the ‘smart society’ as the highly-advanced information society from the Korean case study. Instead of literally interpreting the term ‘smart’ it should be comprehensively re-interpreted as a new academic term that reflects perspectives of social and technological changes, introducing new meanings. The definition and concept or the maturity level of the smart society shall be left for the future study suggestions. We have so far analyzed the characteristics of progressing toward the smart society based on Korea's cases of e-government development. The analysis, though started from certain cases of Korea, will be an applicable model to other countries as well, since Korea is in the leading group in terms of informatization. This paper is distinguished from the other studies because it is an analytical study on the non-technological factors of e-government development: especially focused on the political, socio-economic aspects of e-government. Despite the contribution mentioned above, this paper also has an academic limitation on the generalization of findings because of its a single case study on the Korea. So we will try to explain and analyze the other countries’ cases with the research framework: E-Government Maturity Model based on Socio-political Development of this paper in the next studies. So, this model will be expected to be generally expandable and applicable to e-government cases of other countries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","E-government; E-government maturity model; Highly-advanced information society; Smart city",""

We propose an efficient auction mechanism to incentivise incumbent users to offer shared access to the spectrum they use. The mechanism consists of two stages. In the first stage, LSA licences are auctioned. In the second stage, the incumbent is provided with a choice of either granting access under an LSA agreement to the winner of the auction or not. If the incumbent accepts, its existing licence fee is reduced, whereas, if it rejects, its existing licence fee is increased. The change in the licence fee is such that a rational incumbent always opts to share when it is efficient to do so, i.e. when the cost of sharing is below the value to the secondary user. We also explore how this simple mechanism can be extended to situations in which there is more than one incumbent in a band.

Policy-makers are charged with deciding how that public investment will take place. One approach is via Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), where public and private actors collaborate in UFB (Ultrafast Fibre Broadband) investment, construction and operation. However, the body of analysis of PPPs in NGA networks to guide policy-makers is scant. By using the concept of regulatory commitment, the paper compares the experiences gained in a hold-up situation in PPPs in other infrastructures (e.g. roading) with the UFB context. A case study of New Zealand's Ultrafast Fibre Broadband Initiative is used to draw new insights for government purchasers and regulatory agencies. In comparing the different forms of PPPs, the paper shows that UFB PPPs reverse the typical direction of financing and ownership observed in roading PPPs. Financing and asset ownership are separated in UFB PPPs, increasing the potential for misalignment of incentives and the likelihood that the public party can use its legislative powers to alter regulatory settings after the PPP contract is signed, and thereby hold up the private party once existing network assets are sunk. Whilst the government instigating the PPP may not be inclined to act opportunistically, a successive government facing different political priorities does not face the same incentives. To the extent that the private party can anticipate this risk, it should structure the initial agreement to ensure that the public party is penalised if such an event occurs (i.e. an automatic right to favourable renegotiation or payment of compensation). Such terms will discourage opportunism, so that the project benefits from time-consistent alignment of incentives and objectives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Broadband policy; Hold-up; Infrastructure investment; New Zealand; Next generation access (NGA) networks; Public-private partnerships; Regulatory commitment",""

Thus, regulatory interventions must be based on a careful case-by-case analysis. (2) In the context of zero-rating offers, it is often crucial to evaluate the extent to which users are able to activate and deactivate a (throttled) zero-rated tariff option. If activation/deactivation is easy and instantaneous, a sound economic theory of harm for consumers will in many cases be hard to establish. (3) Similarly, if access to zero-rated partner programs is non-discriminatory and entails low barriers to entry, a sound theory of harm for content providers will usually not be given. (4) Zero-rating can be beneficial for consumers and (legal) content providers alike by contributing to a reduction of illegal content. Combined with throttling it can mitigate congestion problems. However, by requiring all content belonging to the same content category to be treated equally with respect to throttling, independent of whether a content provider opted for zero-rating or not, the existing regulation creates a negative externality on those content providers that do not wish to be zero-rated for some reason. (5) Particular attention should be paid to the impact of throttled zero-rating tariffs on the competition between mobile network operators (MNOs) and MVNOs. The latter may not be able to compete on equal footing with MNOs, because they benefit less from the traffic management aspects of zero-rating. (6) Competition among (infrastructure-based) ISPs provides a safeguard against severe rent extraction and, thus, an abuse of throttling and zero-rating as an exploitative device.

This research posits that the how we done it good paradigm in librarianship reflects a valid and legitimate approach to research. By drawing on the concept of research through design, this study shows how these how we done it good projects reflect design methodologies which draw rigor from process, invention, relevance, and extensibility rather than replicability, generalizability, and predictability. Although these projects implicitly reflect research through design, the methodology is not yet explicitly harnessed in librarianship.

A key finding of this study is that different institutions have largely affected smart governance strategies, arrangements and outcomes. Smart governance is tightly linked with e-governance and e-democracy in some Western countries, while it officially emphasizes smart management and service in China. A common aspect is that the increasing use of social media, smartphones, portals, crowdsourcing platforms, and planning support systems have generally promoted smart governments and services, e-participation, and wider collaboration through both top-down and bottom-up approaches.

Interest in designing better spaces has led to a flowering of user experience studies. Such research into how students use library space could usefully be informed by the theory of embodied cognition, which emphasises the role of the body in thinking and learning. This study explores students' embodied experience of an information commons building. Data were gathered from participatory walking interviews, where students were asked to give the interviewer a guided tour of the building. Findings revealed the way that particular combinations of sensory experience contributed to particular forms of learning. Very small movements or choices seem to reconfigure space significantly. This research also draws attention to the way that different learning atmospheres are actively constructed. The findings contribute a new perspective on inquiry into the use of library space. The potential implication for libraries is the need for more fine grained analysis of use experience from a sensory perspective and for teachers and learners to more explicitly reflect on the role of the body in learning. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","",""

Our contribution is threefold. First, across several platform contexts, we identify (i) (paid) prominence of some third parties over others and (ii) the favouring of a platform's integrated services over independent entities as common discriminatory conducts of online platforms. Second, within this scope, we review the economic literature and find that discrimination in the form of paid prominence may often be in the interest of consumers. However, smaller or low-quality content providers are likely to be worse off, which gives rise to concerns regarding dynamic efficiency and long-term variety in those markets. Additional problems may arise if platform operators are vertically integrated with content providers. Third, based on these theoretical insights, we recommend that EU policy makers should not adopt a neutrality regulation for platforms prematurely. Instead, we recommend to impose new proportionate transparency rules for dominant platforms in order to facilitate the identification of actual misconduct and legal enforcement. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Competition policy; Data neutrality; Discrimination; Internet governance; Neutrality obligations; Online platforms; Prominence; Regulation; Vertical integration",""

Twenty semi-structured interviews with 29 individuals who attended one of three Inspiring Ireland 1916 public collection days were conducted in order to explore participants' motivations for attending the event and perceived benefits. A participatory archives event, the collection days invited members of the public to bring relevant possessions to be digitally captured and have their story of the item recorded. The stories and items were then made available on the Inspiring Ireland website commemorating the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin, Ireland. While participatory initiatives have enjoyed increasing attention in the archives literature of late, much of this work attempts to define terms or model behaviours from the perspective of the archivists. Little existing work attempts to explore the motivations of individuals to participate in these events using empirical methods. Findings suggest motivations for attending a collection day can be characterised across four characteristics that can be categorised as aligning with individual or communal perception of benefits: A) to share their story and provide evidence in order to influence the contemporary narrative of the Rising (individual benefit), B) to relieve the burdens of preservation and remembering (individual benefit), C) to find out more about the object or context of the object (individual benefit), and D) to share their object via the open access features of the Inspiring Ireland website as a way to fulfil a civic duty and support a public good (communal benefit). These findings contradict existing literature about the purpose for engaging in participatory initiatives (to pluralise collections) and assumptions about why individuals are motivated to engage (altruistic, intrinsic motivation). Further exploration of the concept of communal versus individual perceived benefit could influence the ways in which cultural heritage institutions justify their role in society. The concept of an archival user is evolving.

The motivation was to understand how mobile telephony could be a catalyst to create Smart Villages in India, where young people can chart out new pathways to realize their aspirations with regard to tertiary education and new avenues for diversifying into rural non-agricultural employment. We use data obtained from a household survey in villages in the states of Punjab and Tamil Nadu to examine the mobile phone usage preferences of rural educated youth to identify the way forward in improving the accessibility of services on the supply side. We make the case that where youth are using mobile phone access to increase their social information base it is indeed possible that the new social media groups formed by rural youth become a powerful conduit for generating new employment opportunities. The key to accessing this solution is to use a demand driven model for mobile services that would permit a bottom of governance model to generate sustainable growth of enterprises and improved human development of these villages. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Accessibility; Connectivity; Digital inclusion; India; Punjab; Smart cities; Smart villages; Tamil Nadu; Youth aspirations",""

Results showed that growth in mobile phone penetration has contributed significantly to the GDP per capita of the region after controlling for a number of other variables. A 10% increase in mobile phone penetration results in a 1.2% change in GDP per capita. Therefore, improving access to mobile phones will play a critical role in reducing the poverty level of the region through raising the per capita income of the population. However, the Internet has not contributed to the per capita GDP during the study period. The insignificant impact of the Internet could be due to low penetration of the technology, low ICT skill of Internet users, lack of or insufficient local content on the global network, and the relatively immature state of the technology in the region. Therefore, governments and other stakeholders should design policies that encourage expansion of the Internet. In addition to improving Internet access, policies which focus on ICT skill development and local content creation should also be designed and implemented. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","GDP per capita; Internet; Mobile; Sub-Saharan Africa; System GMM",""

On the supply side, significant factors are, first, the availability of a new and very powerful form of mobile connectivity in the shape of 5G, and second, software defined networking, which allows a single network to provide a variety of heterogeneous services or ‘slices’. On the demand side, the digital transformation of the whole economy (and not just the communications sector) creates the need for diverse communications functions operating in a universe with a much wider set of digitally transformed services. Mobile operators will find themselves contesting customer relationship with firms or other organisations providing these services in an integrated fashion, and thus risk replacing their direct link with end users with becoming the wholesale supplier of an expanded but ‘commoditised’ communications product. We may also observe fewer radio access networks; more competitive backhaul; and the (partial) vertical disintegration of mobile network operators. The regulatory changes implied may include heavier regulation of fewer RANs, and the need for market analyses to confront situations in which network operators sell more and more of their services to a variety of heterogeneous content and application providers – some of them exercising substantial levels of market power. © 2018","",""

The aim of this paper is to evaluate whether the 2013 reform had an impact on household fixed internet adoption and to what extent Mexican households, classified into ten wealth groups, had adopted internet. For the assessment, after a revision of supply and demand Reform's measures to reduce the digital divide, data from the 2010 Census and 2015 Intercensal Survey were used to create adoption indexes using Poisson estimations. The results were analyzed by ten wealth groups, constructed on principal components based on household characteristics (type of dwelling, electricity availability, availability of drinking water, sewer system, internet and ICT devices: computer, telephone, cell phone and internet). Additionally, the impact of both indexes was validated by a difference in differences method. The results suggest a 66% overall increase in internet adoption between 2010 and 2015. The decile analysis showed considerable internet adoption in the low and middle wealth groups (deciles 2–8), while in the highest wealth groups (deciles 9–10) the impact of internet adoption has been relatively moderate. It is worth noting that internet adoption is unequally distributed, as less than 1% of households in deciles 1 to 6 had adopted internet in 2015, while nearly all of the wealthiest ten percent of households have internet access. Nevertheless the increment in internet adoption was not only the result of the reform but the combination of the broadband penetration trend and the reform together. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Adoption index; Adoption index; Digital inclusion; Digital inclusion; Econometric estimation; Econometric estimations; Fixed-line broadband; Fixed-line broadband; Impact policy evaluation; Impact policy evaluation; Internet adoption; Internet adoption; Mexico; Mexico; Mexico telecommunications reform; Mexico telecommunications reform",""

However, despite the significant progress in terms of digitization of consumption,1 the region faces still some important development challenges of its digital economy. This paper attempts to identify what the future challenges are for Latin America and the Caribbean, which raises a number of research and policy questions: (1) How close is consumer digitization in Latin America and the Caribbean to the levels observed in industrialized countries? (2) How should Latin America and the Caribbean address the broadband and Internet demand gap of the non-adopting population? (3) Are current digitization trends homogeneous across countries in the region or do we observe a divergence across countries, indicating some advanced nations approaching industrialized country performance, while others lagging? (4) If infrastructure and consumer adoption of certain digital products and services is evolving at a fast pace, what are the upcoming digitization challenges? (5) If broadband is a critical lever for the development of digitization, what are the policies to be implemented by Latin American and Caribbean governments to maximize investment for deployment of last generation technologies and promote adoption? To answer these questions the authors have developed, with support of CAF Latin American Development Bank, a comprehensive digitization index. This new index is used to assess the development of Latin America and the Caribbean region vis-à-vis industrialized countries. On this basis, an econometric model is developed to measure the economic development impact of digitization. Zeroing in on broadband as a critical lever for the development of the digital economy, a set of infrastructure investment and adoption goals is defined for different countries in the region. Finally, public policies are recommended to achieving the established goals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","",""

There exists a wealth of extant conceptual studies, however, further operational studies are needed to establish a specific path towards implementation of such data to governance decision-making with analytical algorithms that are appropriate for each step of the path. This paper proposes a framework for the use of citizen-centered big data analysis to drive governance intelligence in smart cities from two perspectives: urban governance issues and data-analysis algorithms. The framework consists of three layers: 1) A data-merging layer, which builds a citizen-centered panoramic data set for each citizen by merging citizen-related big data from multiple sources in collaborative urban governance via similarity calculation and conflict resolution; 2) a knowledge-discovery layer, which plots the citizen profile and citizen persona at both individual and group levels in terms of urban public service delivery and citizen participation via simple statistical analysis techniques, machine learning, and econometrics methods; and 3) a decision-making layer, which uses ontology models to standardize urban governance-related attributes, personas, and associations to support governance decision-making via data mining and Bayesian Net techniques. Finally, the proposed framework is validated in a case study on blood donation governance in China. This research highlights the value of citizen-centered big data, pushes data-to-decision research from conceptual to operational, synthesizes previously published frameworks for citizen-centered big data analysis in smart cities, and enhances the mutual supplement cross multiple disciplinaries. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Citizen persona; Citizen profile; Citizen-centered big data; Data merging; Data-analysis algorithm; Governance intelligence; Ontology model; Smart cities",""

Fear of exposure or surveillance could threaten an individual's inclination to search for and access information. Understandably then, privacy is understood to be a core professional responsibility of librarians. This study builds on a national report and a qualitative study, completed in the United States, which explored librarians’ attitudes on privacy. Adding a Canadian voice to the literature, this study examines survey results from academic librarians in Canada on their perceptions and attitudes related to library practices and online privacy behaviors. Overall, Canadian academic librarians believe that protecting patron privacy and educating patrons about issues related to online privacy is important. However, many Canadian academic librarians doubt that libraries are doing all they can to protect patron privacy. Academic librarians stand to gain knowledge and understanding of peer attitudes toward online privacy, as well as how patron privacy is being advocated for and protected on university campuses across Canada. The results will guide future library policies and programming aimed at creating an environment where privacy rights are protected and patrons can make informed choices about their online actions. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","",""

The second generation, GSM, is considered the leading example, reaching its peak of deployment in 2015 with 3.83 billion subscribers served by over 700 operators in 219 countries and territories. With 5G rapidly shaping up in the R&D and standardization environments, and a call for leadership with 5G in Europe by policy makers, it is timely to investigate what lessons can be learned from the success of 2G that can be applied to 5G. More broadly, this calls for research into the commonalities and differences between successive generations of mobile technology, their introduction and the market adoption that followed. This also calls for an investigation into the possibility of multiple futures of 5G and how that impacts the opportunity for leadership. As one future may be more desirable than the other, depending on the perspective of the actor involved, a policy debate will be required to determine the most desirable future. As well as a discussion of the policy and regulatory actions required to enable a particular future. Hence, the two-part research question being addressed in this paper is: What explains the success of 2G-GSM and how can it be applied to create success with 5G in the European Union? To respond to the research question this paper first identifies the leadership lessons to be drawn from the success of 2G-GSM in relation to its successors 3G and 4G. Secondly, the contribution describes two stylized images of possible futures of 5G, called “Evolution” and “Revolution” as input to the policy debate on the options for leadership with 5G. These images reflect two extremes in terms of possible futures of 5G. “Evolution” follows the pattern of previous generations and current trends. “Revolution” represents a clear break with these trends and a path towards leadership with 5G, as it exploits the opportunities of standardized APIs for service creation, being enabled by network virtualization as an architectural foundation of 5G. These open and uniformly applied APIs allow the market entry of a multitude of virtual mobile network operators (VMNOs) serving particular industry verticals or economic sectors with tailored feature sets and qualities of services. They allow a market momentum to be built that constitutes leadership with 5G in Europe. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","5G; Europe; Leadership; Mobile communication; Policy; Regulation",""

While a complete interoperability means different cloud users being able to exchange the management tools, server images and other software, this is infrequently realised because users are locked into (proprietary) cloud ecosystems. This (problem of vendor lock-in) is potentially accompanied with another problem revolving around the content delivery networks being integrated with the distinct clouds along with possible harms to media pluralism as well as interoperability. In view of these concerns, this study focuses on competition law, standardisation and regulatory policies, and elaborates on to what extent cloud interoperability needs to be secured under EU legal fora. Overall, it is found that vendor lock-in might be attended by ‘coupling’ and complex ‘layering’ strategies, whereas efficiency and/or security based justifications would arise as the counter-balancing reasons. Based on the findings, the study concludes that while focusing on the vertical (i.e., vendor lock-in) concerns, a comprehensive viewpoint needs to be upheld, allowing efficiencies (i.e., proprietary enhancements) based on the architectural design and innovations, obviating narrowly-fashioned (i.e., foreclosure-based) interventions such as in Microsoft case.

Based on the analyses of government documents and sources, trade journals, and statistic data from business databases, this paper divides the Chinese institutionalization of financial technologies into three stages and identifies the primary actors and paradigms for ICT diffusions in each stage. ICT diffusion has been constitutive but also disruptive to the existing financial policies, instrumental to the commercialization of state-owned banks, and has gradually transformed into a set of formal and informal rules accepted by a network of professionals, corporations, and government agencies. The institutionalization of ICT diffusion has engendered the continuous adjustment of financial policies and propelled innovations in China's financial economy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","China; Fin-tech; ICT diffusion; Institutionalization; Internet finance",""

This depends on frequency bandwidth. Mobile communication failure causes inconveniences in a user's daily life that lead to social and economic damage. To address this issue, mobile telecommunications companies deploy additional bandwidths and develop new technologies, but these are costly strategies. This study applies a spike model based on a contingent valuation method (CVM) to measure the inconvenience cost resulting from mobile communication failure. The mean monthly willingness-to-pay (WTP) to avoid communication failure per user is estimated to be KRW 898.14 (USD 0.80) over a period of five years in our study. The inconvenience cost borne by the population is estimated to be KRW 2.97 trillion (USD 2.61 billion). Users experiencing greater frequency of communication failure are found to be willing to pay more to avoid the inconvenience. When excluding respondents citing zero-WTP, the mean WTP per user was calculated to be KRW 3426.41 (USD 3.01). Data traffic usage and frequency at which communication failure is experienced are variables that exhibit statistically significant effects on WTP to avoid mobile communication failure. Overall, estimation results show that a price discrimination based on data traffic usage or quality can be considered by mobile telecommunications companies and regulators to address the issue of data traffic inducing mobile communication failure. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Contingent valuation method; Inconvenience cost; Mobile communication failure; Mobile data traffic; Spike model",""

Opening a platform allows external firms or individuals to enter the platform ecosystem without any restrictions. A platform connects diverse products and services, and thus the aim of this study is to simultaneously investigate the effect of platform openness on multiple groups of products and services from an ecosystem perspective. This study specifically focuses on the manner in which Android's openness to both applications and devices influences the intentions of application developers to continuously participate in Android platform through the structural equation modeling. First, openness to applications directly influences the participation intention of application developers as well as the user base of the platform. An increased user base leads to the enhanced participation intention of application developers through indirect network effects. Second, openness to devices contributes to increasing the user base, which in turn, positively influences the intention of application developers. Openness to a device also incurs coordination costs between applications and devices, and this has a partially negative effect on the participation of application developers. The contributions of the study include presenting an analytical model that offers a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of platform openness to external developers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Android; Continuance intention to use; Platform ecosystem; Platform openness; Technology platform",""

This study uses a unique dataset based on a survey in France, combined with interviewee's telecommunications billing data, to reveal heterogeneous consumer preferences for fixed services. With the same mixed logit model we estimate the willingness to pay (WTP) for fixed communications services and fixed-mobile relationship. Results show a very large heterogeneity of WTP for fixed services among consumers. In addition, we show that fixed and mobile data are complement for all consumers. Mobile-only consumers have a much lower but non-zero WTP, and higher price sensitivity compared to fixed-mobile consumers. Consequently, an increase in the fixed offer price would reduce the demand for fixed service. Heterogeneous preferences for fixed services constitute an alternative explanation for the existence of mobile-only users, despite the complementary nature of fixed and mobile broadband. Counter-factual simulations show that the share of mobile-only could also be driven by the way to subsidize mobile handset. For instance, making the handset subsidy only available to fixed-mobile quadruple play subscribers could reduce the share of mobile-only by half. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Fixed mobile dependence; Heterogeneous preferences; Mobile only; Substitution versus complementarity",""

The results show that rural computer penetration tends to increase rural residents’ income over time, but the average effect remains limited. The dynamic panel threshold effects model, which allows for both the threshold variable and other covariates to be endogenous, is further used to explore the constraints of the income-increase effect of rural computer penetration. It shows that the effect is at least doubled over the average effect estimated from instrument variables method, once the digital divide causes are removed.

Previous studies of the digital divide were restricted by the lack of sufficiently granular data on broadband availability and adoption. Recent efforts of NTIA and the FCC have made it possible for scholars to perform an exhaustive analysis of broadband diffusion. This paper examines differences in fixed location broadband adoption rates among households of various demographic and socio-economic characteristics and in different geographic locations utilizing the FCC's census tract level adoption data, demographic data from American Community Survey and the census block level broadband availability data from NTIA. Ordered probit models are estimated and used to conduct simulations in order to analyze the determinants of the broadband adoption rate. The results indicate that, although available in most tracts, the lack of broadband availability can still be a deterrent to its adoption. Furthermore, simulations indicate that, in non-metropolitan areas, policies targeting broadband availability would have a larger impact on adoption than policies targeting income or education, for instance. Additionally, where broadband is available, the census tracts with more educated, wealthy and older people who have more choices of broadband providers have higher fixed broadband subscription rates. The positive impact of older population on adoption rate contradicts the conventional belief that the older generation is left behind. Drawing from the previous literature, the older population may be more likely to have a home broadband subscription through traditional technologies, while their younger counterparts, who adapt to new technologies quicker, may be subscribing to mobile broadband. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Digital divide; Fixed location broadband; The National broadband map",""

In the United States, Form 477 data from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) provide a valuable snapshot of broadband provision at the block level, but there are often inconsistencies with the underlying data. These inconsistencies include overly-optimistic self-reports from providers, requirements to report broadband provision within inflexible census administrative units, and a modest temporal reporting schedule (biannual) with a significant, one year temporal lag. These uncertainties are often compounded by telecommunications providers refusing to disclose any information on service footprints, geographic expansion plans or the characteristics of populations served by broadband. This type of obfuscation drastically limits the ability of policy analysts to evaluate outcomes (both positive and negative) associated with service provision and the digital divide, more generally.

This paper evaluates two ways to improve spectrum efficiency to today's noise-limited single-transmitter broadcast television approach. One way is to increase the transmit power of each broadcaster's only transmitter. The other way is to replace that single transmitter with a multi-transmitter low-power low-tower (LPLT) single frequency network (SFN). In order to quantify their potential benefits, two different scenarios are considered. First, this paper presents the results obtained for a large region in which broadcasters are uniformly distributed, so that the number of TV broadcasts that can be received is roughly the same at any location. In this case, results suggest that increasing power of traditional single-transmitter broadcasters could reduce the amount of spectrum needed for TV by up to 30%, and would be cost-effective for population densities above 30 per square km. A switch to SFNs could reduce the amount of spectrum needed for TV by roughly 60%, but at a higher cost. Results suggest that the LPLT SFN approach could be cost-effective for regions with uniformly distributed broadcasters and population densities above 120 per square km. The study then quantifies spectrum efficiency gains in regions where broadcasters are not uniformly distributed. In particular, it considers the case where U.S. broadcasters in the UHF band continue to serve their coverage areas as of 2015. In this case, the amount of spectrum that can be freed from TV throughout the entire nation using these two approach is considerably smaller, but some additional bands can be freed from TV throughout much of the nation. Moreover, most of these spectrum gains can be obtained when only a minority of broadcasters change their technical approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Broadcasting; Repacking; SFN; Single frequency networks; Spectrum; Television",""

Through the lenses of reductionist thinking and cognitive authority, this study employed a multimodal critical discourse analysis approach to analyze the textual and graphic information within a public anti-vaccine Facebook group.

Due to scale economies and sunk costs, the roll-out of NGA is expected to be profitable only for large-scale providers and in densely populated areas. Nonetheless, alternative providers, such as utilities and local communities, have significantly contributed to NGA diffusion in many countries. Over the past five years, several small-scale initiatives have emerged in the UK, bringing fibre networks to urban and rural areas previously overlooked by either commercial or subsidised deployments. A multiple case study approach is employed here to explore the nature and the drivers of niche providers in the UK NGA market. All these initiatives are demand-driven and to follow a modular approach. Despite adopting different business models, they all rely on the resources inherited from past broadband initiatives and relationships with local partners.

This emerging environment is an always-on, ubiquitous, integrated system comprised of the Internet of Things, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence/Intelligent Systems and the Intercloud, which act together as a single system, referred to here as the “Embedded Infosphere” (EI). This development is driving the latest stage – the third – in the evolution of U.S. communications policy. Each of the components of the EI presents unique challenges, but the greater concern is all of them acting in concert. These developments bring into focus many topics that have been outside the traditional communications policy envelope, and exceed the portfolios of existing agencies and institutions. This article envisions a new “EI policy space,” grounded in established societal values, and built on the experience of the previous stages. There are appropriate policy responses to each of the challenges, but these responses need to be seen in a holistic perspective, as they are all interconnected. Many of the issues such as privacy, security, consumer protection, and data stewardship are common across several elements. The larger goal is to establish a framework for an integrated policy structure which can address unpredictable emergent conditions, while allowing markets to flourish without unduly burdensome regulations, restrictions or uncertainties. This articles suggests a high-level analytical framework of criteria against which proposed EI policies can be measured. While there may be no “perfect” policies, some may be better (or worse) than others. It also offers a political process designed to incorporate the concept of the EI into national policy thinking. This approach should be implemented through a series of steps and should provide flexibility for development. The initial step is a process by which the EI can be acknowledged, its development analyzed, and the national interests institutionalized. The U.S. Senate has already initiated this process with the pending “DIGIT” Act, designed to bring together the core federal stakeholders and open a policy discourse which will be expanded over time to other key stakeholders. This should lead to the development of a national EI strategy. Since the EI is progressively global, the article suggests how both the normative and regulatory dimensions can be approached in the global context. It raises the possibility of a restructured ICANN “Empowered Community” as a possible venue for developing policies and recommendations in this area. It notes that since global unanimity is unlikely, non-governmental regimes will likely develop to address the unresolved policy interstices. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial Intelligence; Big data; DIGIT Act; Embedded Infosphere; ICANN; Intercloud; Internet of Things",""

When access charges are regulated, symmetric equilibria occur with multiple equilibrium investments due to the retail-production effect.

Reasons for the failure of legacy regulation to promote product innovations are explained and proposals for alternatives, such as deregulation and regulatory reform are discussed. Both regulation and competition policy are more difficult for ICT than for other sectors. Therefore both, regulation and competition policy may need reforms in order to deal with new problems. The most drastic and most realistic alternative to legacy-type regulation remains deregulation and a move to competition policy. Symmetric regulation, smart regulation, quasi-Coasean approaches and subsidies all have some limited applicability to specific situations, but are all associated with complications that have to be resolved, while competition policy is a comprehensive alternative. Last-mile access and gatekeeper access are analyzed as two main areas of legacy regulation, which are in danger of being exported to other ICT areas. Such exports may negatively affect the dynamics of the ICT industry. Rather than being exported, legacy regulations should be reduced in order to enhance product innovations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Competition policy; Information and communications technology (ICT); Legacy regulation; Product innovations",""

The German regulator decided to sell this spectrum together with spectrum in the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz legacy bands. With only the three incumbent operators bidding in the auction and a relatively transparent auction design, it was possible to get a very clear impression of the actual bidding behaviour. We show that in the beginning of the auction, bidders were actively searching for a way to allocate the available spectrum that all bidders could agree to at low prices. Bidders were teaching each other what they should bid and were providing carrots and sticks. When the excess demand was concentrated in one band only, bidders started to compete head on leading to a war of attrition. This competition only stopped when bidders started to raise prices in bands that were already cleared. We interpret this bidding behaviour in terms of bidders expressing allocative externalities and conclude that the ability to do so may be regarded as a positive aspect of the transparent design. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Allocative externalities; Auctions; Bargaining; Efficient markets; Keywords; Spectrum auctions; Transparency",""

In 2007, the European Commission (EC) introduced a first set of regulatory decisions to cap the maximal roaming fee end users have to pay for voice services. In the years after, additional price caps have been introduced for SMS and data, initially only for end users, in a later stage also for the wholesale tariff. The final step, Roaming Like at Home (RLAH), will start to take effect in June 2017; from then on end users will pay the same price (for voice, SMS and data) when roaming like in their domestic country. The effect of RLAH on the business case of each mobile operator is hard to predict, as the different national markets are extremely heterogeneous and operators face large discrepancies in terms of roaming usage and network costs due to different travelling patterns and various other reasons that cannot be harmonized (geography, economics, working force, usage history, etc.). Furthermore, competition in the telecom market will no longer be a purely national matter, as the decision to abolish roaming tariffs will fully open up cross-border competition. This paper aims at providing insights in the effect of RLAH for both the end user as well as the mobile operators. Following a literature survey approach, including an overview of the roaming regulation process from 2007 up to now, the paper discusses possible effects the RLAH initiative might trigger, going from lower wholesale prices for mobile operators to higher retail prices for end users. Additionally, as the European Commission strives for a digital single market, this paper presents a number of technical solutions (carrier portability, software-based SIMs, cross-border IMSI, Roaming like a Local, Wi-Fi offloading) that may pose a - partial or full - alternative for roaming and explains how these may impact cross-border competition both positively and negatively. The solutions are assessed against two axes: (1) generating the best possible outcome for the end customers (in all countries) and (2) ensuring the best level playing field for (virtual) mobile operators in Europe, which will of course involve trade-offs on different levels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","International roaming; Policy; RLAH; Roam Like At Home",""

This study examines the effects of six-year integrated information literacy instruction on elementary students' memory and comprehension of subject content through inquiry learning and also focuses on the moderating factor of students' academic achievement levels. The subjects were 75 students participating in the study from the time when they entered elementary school. The school adopted information literacy instruction and integrated it into various subject areas using the framework of inquiry learning, for example, the Super3 and Big6 models. A total of 11 inquiry learning projects were implemented from Grade 1 through Grade 6. The results showed that inquiry-based integrated information literacy instruction helps students memorize facts and apply new concepts in the subject content. In general, the progress level in comprehension was higher than in memory learning for the six-year integrated information literacy instruction. Regardless of students' prior academic achievement levels, if they devoted their efforts to inquiry processes, their fact memorization and conceptual understanding of subject content improved. Low-achieving students displayed the most progression in both memory and comprehension learning, compared to their medium- and high-achieving peers.

Since most of the data is currently stored in cloud data centers, it also compares how blockchain performs vis-vis the cloud in various aspects of security and privacy. Key underlying mechanisms related to the blockchain's impacts on the Internet of Things (IoT) security are also covered. From the security and privacy considerations, it highlights how blockchain-based solutions could possibly be, in many aspects, superior to the current IoT ecosystem, which mainly relies on centralized cloud servers through service providers. Using practical applications and real-world examples, the paper argues that blockchain's decentralized feature is likely to result in a low susceptibility to manipulation and forgery by malicious participants. Special consideration is also given to how blockchain-based identity and access management systems can address some of the key challenges associated with IoT security. The paper provides a detailed analysis and description of blockchain's roles in tracking the sources of insecurity in supply chains related to IoT devices. The paper also delves into how blockchain can make it possible to contain an IoT security breach in a targeted way after it is discovered. It discusses and evaluates initiatives of organizations, inter-organizational networks and industries on this front. A number of policy implications are discussed. First, in order to strengthen IoT, regulators can make it obligatory for firms to deploy blockchain in supply chain, especially in systems that are mission critical, and have substantial national security and economic benefits. Second, public policy efforts directed at protecting privacy using blockchain should focus on providing training to key stakeholders and increasing investment in this technology. Third, one way to enrich the blockchain ecosystem would be to turn attention to public–private partnerships. Finally, national governments should provide legal clarity and more information for parties to engage in smart contracts that are enforceable. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain; Cloud computing; Cybersecurity; Internet of things; Privacy; Supply chain",""

This has been the key argument for the use of combinatorial auctions in the recent years. Considering synergistic valuations turns the allocation problem into a computationally hard optimization problem that generally cannot be approximated to a constant factor in polynomial time. Ascending auction designs such as the Simultaneous Multiple Round Auction (SMRA) and the single-stage or two-stage Combinatorial Clock Auction (CCA) can be seen as simple heuristic algorithms to solve this problem. Such heuristics do not necessarily compute the optimal solution, even if bidders are truthful. We study the average efficiency loss that can be attributed to the simplicity of the auction algorithm with different levels of synergies. Our simulations are based on realistic instances of bidder valuations we inferred from bid data from the 2014 Canadian 700 MHz auction. The goal of the paper is not to reproduce the results of the Canadian auction but rather to perform “out-of-sample” counterfactuals comparing SMRA and CCA under different synergy conditions when bidders maximize payoff in each round. With “linear” synergies, a bidder's marginal value for a license grows linearly with the total number of licenses won, while with the “extreme national” synergies, this marginal value is independent of the number of licenses won unless the bidder wins all licenses in a national package. We find that with the extreme national synergy model, the CCA is indeed more efficient than SMRA. However, for the more realistic case of linear synergies, SMRA outperforms various versions of CCA that have been implemented in the field including the one used in the Canadian 700 MHz auction. Overall, the efficiency loss of all ascending auction algorithms is small even with high synergies, which is remarkable given the simplicity of the algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Combinatorial auctions; Market design; Simulation experiments; Spectrum auctions",""

This paper uses an engineering-economic model to show that there are strong economies of scale when expanding capacity, because an MNO with more spectrum benefits more from every new cell tower, and an MNO with more towers benefits more from every new MHz of spectrum. While it is technically possible to expand capacity by increasing either towers or spectrum holdings, we find that the cost-effective approach is to increase both types of assets at a similar rate. In the absence of countervailing policies, the big MNOs are well positioned to get bigger, in terms of spectrum holdings, towers, and ultimately market share. For policymakers, this economy of scale creates a trade-off between two important objectives: reducing the cost of cellular capacity, and increasing competition. This paper derives the Pareto optimal division of spectrum with respect to these two competing objectives, and shows that any Pareto optimal assignment will split the spectrum fairly evenly among competing MNOs. This is not simply a method of ensuring that there are many competitors; spectrum should be divided fairly evenly regardless of whether the number of competitors is large or small. A large disparity in spectrum holdings may yield poor results with respect to both objectives, i.e. the lower cost-effectiveness of a larger number of MNOs, and the lower competitive pressure of a smaller number of MNOs. One effective way to achieve a division of spectrum that is close to Pareto optimal is a spectrum cap, provided that this cap is set at a level consistent with other policies and policy objectives, including antitrust policy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cellular; Competition; Economy of scale; Market concentration; Spectrum; Spectrum cap",""

Dominant network operators in Canada have shown relatively stronger incentives than their counterparts in the U.S. to invest in and increase the capacity of legacy platforms. In the U.S. FTTP deployment incentives have been somewhat stronger, but network operators have been more reluctant to upgrade legacy technologies to deliver higher speeds. Diversity of strategic choices by large operators helps explain increasing regional and local broadband infrastructure gaps within the two countries. A high dividend payout financial strategy and increasing vertical integration appear to enhance the potential for overinvestment and inefficient duplication in legacy platforms by competing infrastructure providers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Broadband; Creative destruction; Innovation; Strategy; Technological change",""

Findings suggest that social scientists' data reuse intentions are directly influenced by the subjective norm of data reuse, attitudes toward data reuse, and perceived effort involved in data reuse. Attitude toward data reuse mediated social scientists' intentions to reuse data, leading to the indirect influence of the perceived usefulness and perceived concern of data reuse, as well as the indirect influence of the subjective norm of data reuse.

New spectrum sharing arrangements have been identified as effective ways to satisfy emerging connectivity needs. In particular, the so-called Licensed Shared Access (LSA) regime has been given prominence in the European Union (EU) to facilitate access to additional spectrum necessary to meet the exponential growth of mobile data traffic. Under the LSA regime, already occupied, but underutilised spectrum would be shared, on a licensed-basis, between incumbents and mobile operators, under agreed frequency, location and time sharing conditions. A similar system has been proposed in the United States (US), called Spectrum Access System (SAS). In this context, the purpose of this paper is two-fold: firstly, to assess the novelty of the LSA regime with respect to existing spectrum sharing arrangements in the EU and, secondly, to identify the main differences between the LSA and the SAS regimes. Policy documents, academic papers, position papers and analysis reports are scrutinised to gather information on technical and regulatory aspects of existing and emerging spectrum sharing regimes. This paper concludes that the novelty of the LSA regime is found in the possibility for mobile operators to access additional spectrum below 6 GHz (GHz) with the regulatory certainty required to invest in 5G. Implementing other spectrum sharing regimes to access sub-6 GHz spectrum would not guarantee mobile operators protection from harmful interference and predictable Quality of Service (QoS). The comparison between the LSA and the SAS approaches suggests that the LSA regime can be implemented quicker and with less effort than the SAS regime, because of its lower level of technical complexity. Nevertheless, the LSA regime is expected to be overtaken by the SAS regime in the long term, as technology advances. The SAS regime would allow more users to coexist in the same spectrum bands thanks to spectrum sensing techniques. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","5G; Dynamic efficiency; Licensed shared access; Spectrum access system; Spectrum sharing",""

The other technology that has grown in importance since 1976—the Internet—is widely regarded as a raging success. Although no history is completely uniform, the past forty years illustrates the key considerations underlying the choice between whether to impose access regulations or whether to rely on facilities-based competition.

This quest has led to the development of different spectrum sharing solutions in different parts of the world for optimising spectrum use in various spectrum bands. Despite the active widespread research on spectrum sharing over nearly two decades, only a few solutions have attracted the interest of industry and regulators as potential concepts for adoption. Though the selected solutions offer great promise, none have proven commercially successful at the time of the writing of this document. The process to introduce and adopt a new sharing concept in a specific spectrum band is very complex and the manner in which this introduction can take place varies considerably based on the regulation structure and the cultural norms of the nation where the deployment takes place. However, some general principles can be found and established for the process. Knowledge of these principles will allow researchers to develop their approaches taking into account requirements arising from different stakeholders in various phases of this process. In this paper, the spectrum sharing ecosystem and three prominent and most recent regulatory spectrum sharing concepts from Europe and US are introduced. Based on an analysis of these concepts, a general process model for spectrum sharing is introduced covering the roles and tasks of different stakeholders and emphasizing the need for seamless cooperation and interactions between them at different phases of the process. The general process model that is presented here can serve as a guideline for the development of new spectrum sharing models and help regulatory authorities to optimize the existing processes by pinpointing tasks for each stakeholder as providing a guide for the critical information that is needed for each phase of the process. Moreover, for academic and industry research and especially those involved with entrepreneurial endeavours, the paper gives a useful overview of the complicated administrative process behind and factors that contribute to the regulatory acceptance of a sharing concept. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CBRS; Citizen's Broadband Radio System; Interference control; Licensed Shared Access; LSA; SAS; Spectrum Access System; Spectrum management; Spectrum regulation; Spectrum sharing; TV white spaces; TVWS",""

In recent years, there has been heated ongoing debate regarding whether offering different pricing plans, such as zero-rated services and applications, might slant user behavior toward certain content on the Internet. Our study gathers empirical measurements of mobile application usage to address this research question. We shed light on this issue by performing an exploratory analysis of the effects of different data plans and connection types on mobile data usage, as well as measuring quantitative and qualitative pricing effects of zero-rating on mobile data usage. First, we perform a longitudinal exploratory study using data collected from the MySpeedTest application. We analyze differences in usage behavior between the top five most used applications in the United States (US) and South Africa (ZA), comparing usage on different connection types (Wi-Fi vs. cellular) as well as for devices on different data plans (prepaid vs. postpaid limited monthly data cap vs. uncapped). Our findings show that US users consume slightly more cellular data than Wi-Fi data for most of the US top five most used applications, while South African users generally prefer Wi-Fi connections (with the notable exception of Facebook). Further, US users on postpaid plans display much higher average monthly mobile data usage than those on prepaid plans, while South African users on prepaid plans generally display much higher usage than those on postpaid plans. Next, we perform a deeper analysis into the possible behavioral effects of zero-rating in South Africa. We find in one case that zero-rating WhatsApp on Cell-C's network increases overall usage of the application, regardless of connection type. In the case of zero-rating Twitter on MTN network, we observe increased mobile data usage of the zero-rated application during and immediately after the promotion, but not in the long term. Some of our results yield striking patterns, yet point to the need for richer datasets to confirm these initial findings. Finally, to gain further insights into the user motivations behind our empirical observations, we implement a mobile-based survey among a randomly selected group of individuals in South Africa and Kenya. We observe that use of zero-rating services is actually quite low among respondents. Further, zero-rating seems to serve more as a popular method for data conservation—an effort toward which respondents show a strong dedication—than as a walled garden that would otherwise discourage users from venturing beyond zero-rated applications. © 2017 The Authors","Mobile pricing; Mobile usage; Zero-rating",""

While regulatory policy has therefore shifted towards innovation as its major goal besides enabling competition, there appear to be tensions between regulation, competition and innovation. This paper identifies as the roots of these tensions the consumer protection objective enshrined in regulatory legislation and the regulatory neutrality issues arising from stranded assets, loss of labor rents, loss of services by captive customers, and the threat to regulators from looming deregulation, all of which are associated with innovations. This paper identifies some similar threats to innovation in unregulated sunk-cost industries with a monopolistic incumbent. A very simple model shows that a comparison of innovation incentives in such an unregulated industry with a regulated one leads to ambiguous results. However, the prospect of converting a regulated industry into an unregulated one after the innovation has occurred will unambiguously increase innovation incentives. © 2016","Entrant; Incumbent; Innovation; Next generation access network; Sunk cost",""

Moreover, the results derived from fixed telephone lines are higher compared to mobile phone lines even though the positive impact of the latter is more robust for each income category. Although the linear impact of Internet penetration and usage is positive and significant for lower-middle-income countries, the results remain inconclusive compared to other ICT innovations.

In response, the South Korean government and mobile carriers have implemented measures such as a “Smart Choice Service,” data-centered plan, and 20% discount scheme in order to reduce mobile bills. However, it is unclear whether these systems have actually led to such a reduction. The present study analyzes quantitatively how people's acceptance and awareness toward rate systems reduce or do not reduce mobile bills, based on the results of a survey conducted here. More specifically, to solve the endogeneity problem of saving behavior's effect on mobile bills, the study adopts the instrumental variables of degree of acceptance and awareness of systems relating to mobile bills. The results show that acceptance and awareness of the system do affect savings behavior and thus mobile bills. If the degree of savings behavior (affected by acceptance and awareness) goes up one step on a seven-point Likert-type scale, there is an average 8.28% savings effect on mobile bills.

It examines the relationship between mobile phone access, citizen engagement, and appropriation of the technology by the governing elite for political communication and electoral campaigns. It concludes that Ghana has witnessed a rich convergence of mobile telephony and broadcast media which, in tandem with an open political environment, has significantly transformed the ecology of political communication. This development has helped to deepen democratic engagement among citizens, and between citizens and the political class, by fostering civic vigilance and accountability and facilitating multivocal expression of views from a more diverse constituency of political participants. However, while mobile phones and related platforms have allowed contra- and counter-hegemonic voices in Ghanaian politics to find expression across the electromagnetic spectrum, this access should not be construed to necessarily mean that political discourse has shifted in significant ways as to alter the fundamental structures of political power. Overall, the fundamental structures of political power and the levers of control remain unassailed by ordinary citizens, despite some of the progress made possible by mobile telephony. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","",""

Grounded in basic psychological needs theory, the current study examines the motivation of students’ autonomous information seeking and its relationship with the amount of effort invested in and enjoyment derived from information seeking. Autonomy support and perceived competence were found to explain 34.7% of the variance in autonomous motivation while autonomous motivation, in turn, explained 13.1% of variance in effort and 25.8% variance in enjoyment. The model indicates a positive relationship between basic psychological needs and autonomous motivation. Higher students’ autonomy support and perceived competence levels lead to increases in autonomous motivation to seek information. Higher autonomous motivation levels, similarly, lead to higher levels of effort and enjoyment. Findings confirm that intrinsically motivated students enjoy information seeking more and invest more effort in the activity. This highlights the importance of encouraging students to engage in information seeking independently, while providing the necessary guidance that would increase their competence. © 2018","",""

The paper asks whether there was any case of pork barrelling in the selection of early release sites that enjoyed a regional competitive advantage against other localities that had to wait several years to receive the infrastructure. The answer to this question then leads to a second question about the degree to which voting in the early NBN release sites has swung following the infrastructure rollout. In order to answer these questions the paper examines the voting patterns in the earlier NBN release sites versus all electorates in the Federal elections in 2007–2013 using the data available via Australian Electoral Commission.

We identify these variables, such as: spectrum packaging policy, reserve price, demand limit, activity rule, transparency and pricing rule. We also analyze the different ways in which regulators can design them along with their implications. This theoretical work is accompanied by a review of the practical implementation decisions in each actual auction and final outcomes.

The sector was mostly composed by a dominant player, a rationed market (low density of services), a poor institutional design, high tariffs, and weak regulation agents. The Herfindahl-Hirschman (HHI) index was 5333 for mobile telephone and 7,029 for fixed telephone services—among the highest scores in the world. In order to promote competition in the sector, Congress approved a reform in 2013 to establish a new regulator empowered to impose asymmetrical rules in the case of the predominance of a single firm. A declaration of preponderance of the dominant player was issued, promoting free interconnection rates and the mandatory sharing of its passive and active infrastructure with the rest of the firms in the industry. The new institutional design led to increased competition in the sector, decreasing the mobile and fixed telephone prices while increasing the coverage and penetration of these services. In this article, an applied general equilibrium model for the Mexican economy is employed to assess the impact of the Telecommunication Reform in Mexico in the telephone sector, consumer welfare, and income distribution. The model is static, encompassing 10 types of consumers (rural and urban and the five income quintiles) and 40 sectors (of which four are disaggregate telecommunications industries). It assumes fixed wages and capital rental prices as well as idle resources. The main results indicate that the effects of the reform are not minor; the drop in telephone prices would reduce the general consumer price index by almost 2%, and the value added would increase by more than 3%, benefiting mainly households in the highest income quantiles. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","General equilibrium models; Mexico telecommunication sector; Telecommunication reform",""

In both cases, the use of this spectrum could reduce the rollout costs of a Radio Access Network (RAN) based on Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology. The perceived value of 700 MHz is presented in this article as the difference in the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of deploying the network with and without this spectrum. However, the rollout costs can differ greatly among MNOs if they previously hold different spectrum portfolios that may or may not include sub-1 GHz frequencies. The results of this study reveal that an MNO not holding the additional 2×10 MHz at 800 MHz, would perceive 62% more value of 2×10 MHz at 700 MHz, than an MNO that does hold 2×10 MHz at 800 MHz. In addition, the value of this spectrum comes largely from urban areas, where networks are strongly capacity-constrained. This leads to the conclusion that under current demand forecasts, low-frequency spectrum starts being more valuable for simply being spectrum, rather than for being low frequency. Indeed, the results prove that adding spectrum with similar propagation characteristics to a coverage-constrained network is of no value. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","LTE techno economic analysis; Opportunity cost of spectrum; Second digital dividend; Spectrum value",""

In order to address this problem, governments across Africa have established universal service funds (USF) as their universal service strategy. Nonetheless, various studies have suggested that the problem of limited coverage remains unaddressed due, in part, to the poor implementation of USF. This raises the question as to why USF have failed to address the limited coverage of telecommunication services in Africa? We seek to answer this question by investigating the interplay between market liberalisation and universal service using a multiple case study approach with examples drawn from across the continent. We find that poor policy formulation limits the implementation of an effective USF model in Africa. In addition, inadequate stakeholder engagement, lack of accountability, inaccurate data, undue political influence and the narrow scope of universal service all impinge on the ability of USF to achieve their objectives. We, therefore, propose the need for future research to address these challenges and develop our framework to unravel some of the intractable areas of universal service such as determining what services should fall within the scope of universal service and how to prevent policy redundancy in a fast moving industry such as mobile telecommunications. © 2017","Africa; Liberalisation; Telecommunications; Universal service; Universal service fund",""

In this paper, we survey the academic literature on data caps and analyze the relationship between the characteristics of each paper's model or data and the paper's results. We find that model or data assumptions about service differentiation, purpose of the data cap, and amount of competition strongly influence each paper's results. Consequently, conclusions about the effect of data caps are often limited to certain types of service providers (fixed or mobile) and/or to certain types of data caps (heavy-users or profit-maximizing). We find that most proponents’ claims about data caps in fixed broadband service are incorrect, and that most proponents’ claims about data caps in mobile broadband service are likely to be correct if and only if data caps increase competition. We also discuss how data caps may be evaluated under the FCC's 2015 Open Internet Order. We find that heavy-users caps on mobile broadband service are likely to satisfy the Order's rules, that profit-maximizing caps on mobile broadband service may or may not satisfy the rules, and that caps on fixed broadband service are unlikely to satisfy the rules. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Broadband Internet access service; Data caps; Network management; Open internet; Usage-based pricing",""

In relation to efficiency, spectrum caps or set asides for new entrants can be incorporated to combat the exercise of market power downstream. In relation to equity objectives, licence conditions may specify obligations to provide coverage in non-commercial areas, or promises of the attainment of social objectives can be given a weighting, with revenue, in the determination of winning bids.

Two alternative approaches have been proposed to replace or to be applied next to governmental control: (1) property rights; and (2) a commons, with restrictions in the type of use or users. Although elements of both proposals have been implemented, the resulting mixed regime is still a top down process with many rigidities and a government in control. Proper implementation of these alternative approaches requires a shift in the role of the government from a controller of the spectrum management process to a facilitator of decentralized coordination in the market in a multi-actor spectrum governance process. The role of the government shifts to market design, monitoring and facilitation. This shift in the role of the government is relatively absent in the debate on spectrum management. This paper makes a proposal for this shifting role of the government, provides the rationale for this shift and includes guidance on its implementation.

It focuses on aspects of compliance, monitoring, and enforcement of policy objective relating to ordinary consumer interest, areas that receive inadequate attention in policy literature. The study is conducted using the new institutional economics framework. It adapts and extends the Saleth and Dinar (1999) institution decomposition model to deconstruct the mobile institution into four major components: policy, law, administration and enforcement for analytical purposes. Using document analysis, supplemented by semi-structured interviews, the study provides insights into how the regulatory framework engages with the ordinary consumer and the implications this has for the delivery of the policy objective of protecting ordinary consumer interest. The main findings reveal that (1) due to weak institutional structures, the regulator and mobile service providers do not hold ordinary consumer's interest at levels consistent with policy and law (2) there is no special intervention to make basic mobile services accessible and affordable for low-income ordinary consumers and (3) the pervasive violation of consumer interest persists due to laxity in enforcement of existing rules. The public interest in telecommunications policy has so far benefitted mobile companies in Nigeria rather than ordinary consumers. The existing policy failure, as discussed in this case study, can provide inspiration for rethinking the place of the ordinary consumer. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Enforcement; Institution decomposition; New institution economics; Nigeria; Regulation; Telecommunications policy failure",""

In light of this, federal policy efforts have switched from focusing mainly on the provision of infrastructure to more explicit adoption-oriented efforts. One of those efforts was the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC's) Low-income Broadband Lifeline Pilot Projects, which ran from 2013 to 2014. The program worked with 14 private telecommunications firms to subsidize household broadband adoption for low-income households by providing discounted monthly and equipment costs. Low-income households are an important component of the broadband adoption puzzle: between 2003 and 2013, the adoption gap between low-income and high-income households actually increased by 5% points. This paper focuses on two specific FCC Broadband Lifeline Pilot projects that allowed consumers to make choices among different options, such as data allowance, speed, and wireless vs. wired connections. Conditional logit models are used to develop estimates of consumer's willingness-to-pay for specific broadband attributes. The results indicate that low-income consumers have a preference for smartphone connections (versus aircards) – and that this effect is even more pronounced for those households earning less than $20,000; that low-income consumers have a preference for wired connections (versus wireless); and that there is evidence that low-income consumers are willing to pay for an extra GB of data each month – but not for the speed of their connection. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Broadband; Lifeline pilot projects; Willingness-to-pay",""

WAPECS aimed to introduce more flexibility into the European spectrum management framework by allowing technology and service neutrality. Internationally, the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) have been keen to introduce more flexibility into the international service allocation framework. One of the main findings of this paper is the identification of different negative perceptions and disagreement about WAPECS among industry and regulatory stakeholders. Moreover, it is shown that concerns over WAPECS include that the flexibility associated with it may contradict with spectrum use efficiency and that the responsibility of resolving interference issues moves from the regulator to operators. The assessment of the influence of WAPECS on the market shows that while the concept was aimed mainly towards removing the spectrum usage restriction for industry, they have not appreciated this mainly due to the high cost and uncertainty associated with flexibility.

This study assesses the cost implications for the rollout of fixed access networks capable of providing citizens with downstream broadband capacities of 30 Mbps or 100 Mbps, which have been defined in the European Digital Agenda as targets that should be met by 2020. A cost model was employed to determine the cost of a home passed and the cost of a home connected for various fibre- and copper-based networks in rural areas. It was found that the cost of deploying a network outside a town or village in a rural area is on average 80% higher than the cost of deploying the network in the town or village. This situation may lead to a digital divide within the same rural area. For all the geotypes analysed, the following order of costs (in descending order) was identified: FTTH, FTTdp-Building, FTTdp-Street, FTTRN, FTTC and CO-VDSL. Given the long lengths of distribution, feeder and drop segments required, some network architectures will not be able to provide all households in some areas with the minimum bandwidth of 30 Mbps as defined in the European Digital Agenda. Overall, it is possible that operators will need to create a combination of various broadband access networks, due to the significant cost differences between networks. Policymakers will need to address several topics to promote the rollout of broadband networks in rural areas: how the digital divide within a rural area can be avoided; a National Broadband Plan that clearly addresses the provisioning of broadband in rural areas; elaboration of studies on broadband demand in rural areas; and the assessment of costs and technical capacity of wireless networks in rural areas. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Broadband; Cost; Fixed networks; Rural",""

Given that a notable characteristic of Japan's economy is that small as well as older firms play a much greater role than in other economies, particularly the United States, our analysis mainly focuses on firms' size and age. As a first step of our investigation, using firm-level data, we examine whether larger and/or younger firms tend to have a higher ICT intensity. We find that larger firms indeed have a higher ICT intensity. In the case of firm age, there was no simple linear relationship between firm age and ICT intensity. As a next step, we estimate a Cobb-Douglas type production function and test whether the ICT input coefficient differs across different firm-size groups and firm-age groups. We find that larger firms and younger firms tend to have a higher ICT input coefficient. Another factor that may be responsible for differences in ICT intensity by firm size and firm age is constraints on ICT input. To check whether this is the case, we calculate the marginal product of ICT input by firm-size group and firm-age group using the production function estimates. We find that smaller firms and younger firms tend to have a higher marginal product of ICT input. These findings suggest that smaller firms and younger firms face constraints that prevent them from increasing ICT input. We also examine impediments to the full use of ICT by Japanese firms, based on our analysis as well as preceding studies. We find that to enhance ICT input, the government should develop the market for business process outsourcing, which includes outsourcing of ICT processes, and resolve the scarcity of ICT experts, by supporting the training of ICT experts at universities and making it easier for foreign ICT experts to work in Japan. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The study concludes by pointing out the lack of certain themes in the professional discourses, such as the themes of user communities, open access, and advocacy. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","",""

In this paper we argue that these two facts are related. Using the EU KLEMS dataset we test the capital-skill complementarity hypothesis in a cross-section of sectors in Spain. We find that the substitutability between workers and ICT assets falls as worker skill level rises, and that this feature holds across all sectors. Furthermore, the ICT assets are complementary with skilled workers. The fraction of workers employed with medium and high skills across sectors rose by 21% and 12%, respectively, to the disadvantage of low skilled workers, due to an adjustment within sectors more than to a composition effect between sectors. Finally, using a regression analysis, we conclude that some labor market institutions are likely behind the evolution of sectorial productivity and ICT investment in Spain. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Under this model, regulation is designed to enable entrants to make progressively greater investments in their own networks, whilst decreasing their dependence on the network of the incumbent fixed operator. The ultimate goal of the LoI approach is to achieve, where feasible, inter-platform competition. However, it is unclear, from a theoretical perspective, whether the LoI approach to regulation will necessarily lead to inter-platform competition. Whether and under what circumstances it would is thus an empirical question. There is a rich literature which has empirically estimated the degree to which the LoI describes the evolution of competition in Western European (WE) countries. The contribution of this paper is to empirically test whether the LoI also explains the development of telecommunications markets in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. Our analysis finds that the telecommunications entrants in CEE countries largely chose to by-pass the LoI, by directly investing in their own networks. There are good reasons for this, as some of the necessary conditions which underpin the LoI theory, such as good quality and widely available copper networks, and the relatively high cost and risk of investing in alternative infrastructure, do not necessarily hold in CEE countries. The implication of this result is that the LoI should not be considered a universally applicable theory which explains the evolution of competition in all broadband markets. Rather its applicability depends on several country specific factors which were not present to the same degree in CEE countries compared with WE countries. Policy makers, regulators and competition authorities therefore need to take this into account when dealing with the issues of entry, investment and competition in broadband markets across the CEE region. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper applies conjoint analysis to evaluate consumers’ willingness to pay for each of the attributes of a Super Wi-Fi service and estimates by how much consumer welfare could be increased by the introduction of a Super Wi-Fi service. The attributes of a Super Wi-Fi service are coverage, a reduction in communication expenses when using mobile data, the ability to use multiple screens, and a wide range of Wi-Fi service providers. The results based on user surveys indicated that the marginal willingness to pay per month for a Super Wi-Fi service is KRW 4717 (USD$4.6). Moreover, marginal willingness to pay in nonurban areas for this service is greater than that in urban areas, which implies that the introduction of a Super Wi-Fi service is expected to increase consumer welfare, especially in nonurban areas. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Conjoint analysis; Consumer welfare; Super Wi-Fi; Willingness to pay",""

Concerning demand side factors the paper demonstrates how potential market size and existing technology trajectory work in favor of IoT diffusion. As a related demand side factor the paper argues that, in terms of the technological trajectory, China has started farther from the frontier than most industrialized countries. The degree of incremental benefit from the IoT is thus higher in the country. As to the supply side factors, the article promotes an understanding of how Chinese technology companies have capitalized on a huge user base to develop IoT-based applications. It also suggests that technologies and expertise provided by foreign multinationals have also played crucial roles. Regarding formal institutions, the government's proactive policies have been a major factor in the IoT's evolution. It is also in the Chinese government's interest to develop IoT products to make censorship and surveillance more effective. Regarding informal institutions, Chinese consumers are less concerned than Westerners about being tracked and monitored, which provides a favorable condition for the adoption of IoT-enabled devices. Nonetheless, this condition is changing due to increasing abuse of consumer privacy. China and the U.S. are compared in terms of diffusion, key determinants, performance indicators and impacts of the IoT in order to understand the areas that China outperforms—and underperforms—the U.S. Some indicators are proposed to gauge the IoT-related performance and the impacts of the IoT. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","China; Institutions; Internet of Things; Leapfrogging; Smart city; Standardization",""

Indeed, one such contract brings down the portion of the investment cost borne by the ISPs (for a given cost of investment), increases end users' demand for improved connectivity and internalizes investment externalities. It is studied how a departure from network neutrality (NN) regulation of the Internet, allowing the ISP to negotiate with the CP a fee for (priority) delivery of content, affects firms' investment incentives. Using a simple model, it is shown that the ISP may invest more with than without NN, since the CP may have high bargaining power ex post (after NGA investment is sunk). Instead, the CP may be more willing to co-invest when NN is abandoned, either to evade high ex post fees (if the investment cost is low), or to foster NGA deployment (if the investment cost is high and the ISP has low bargaining power ex post). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It commands a 55% share in the global market for IT services. India's IT sector value proposition in terms of low cost with large supply of high quality talent is compelling. As a result, India has become the premier choice not only for outsourcing IT services by the developed-world's multinational corporations (MNCs) but also for locating their own Global In-house Centers (GICs), which simultaneously compete and partner with local firms. This gave rise to six additional clusters beyond the earliest, largest and robust cluster, Bangalore. The paper provides a review of relevant literature; develops a conceptual framework for evaluation of clusters; and presents data and analysis with respect to relative size, growth, specialization, MNC presence and connectivity to local firms through expatriates and returning Indians, innovation; and discusses adequacy of ICT infrastructure for future growth. Although there are clear signs that the Indian IT sector has been moving towards a regime of providing high-end value added services, the sector's value proposition – lower cost combined with a large supply of high quality talent – remains the single most compelling reason for the rise and growth of multiple export clusters. Thus the sector's growth appears to be a case of growth by replication rather than innovation. The paper concludes that the Indian IT sector's value proposition in terms of lower cost combined with large supply of high quality talent remains the single most compelling reason for the rise and growth of multiple IT services export clusters. While the old adage, “people follow jobs” still holds for large part of the labor force, there is little doubt that the sprawling IT services clusters in India - with more to come from Tier II and Tier III cities – indicate, in fact, that “jobs follow talent.” Both local firms and the MNCs, through their GICs, are pushing the boundaries of location farther and farther to continue to leverage cost advantage and available pools of talent. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","High-tech clusters; Indian IT clusters; IT services exports; MNC linkages; Off-shoring of services",""

This positive relationship, however, is weaker for news and cultural programs than for dramas and variety shows, and is absent for unpopular television programs. Based on the study results, several implications are offered to television broadcasters, advertisers and broadcasting regulators. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Distribution channel; IPTV; Media; Total screening rate; Video on demand",""

We employ a half-yearly dataset for 20 EU countries for the 2008–2011 period and apply dynamic panel data methods. Our analysis demonstrates strong access substitution between fixed-lines and mobiles and provides indicative evidence on the substitution between fixed-lines and VoIP. Overall, we find evidence in favor of access substitution and therefore of joint market definition. Regulatory obligations imposed on the market for access to fixed telephone networks might therefore be redundant. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","(De)regulation; Dynamic panel data analysis; Fixed-mobile-VoIP substitution; Market definition; Telecommunications markets",""

While the number of subscriptions reaches population saturation levels, the bandwidth divide continuous to be dynamic. The article measures the nationally installed bandwidth potential of 172 countries from 1986 to 2014. The overarching finding is that the divide in terms of bandwidth does not show any clear monotonic pattern. It fluctuates up and down over the decades as the result of an intricate interplay between incessant technological progress and diffusion of technology. The bandwidth divide between high- and low income countries has first increased and only decreased below historic levels very recently during 2012-2014. In general it shows that the bandwidth divide is linked to the income divide, which is notoriously persistent. The bandwidth distribution among all countries is undergoing a new process of global concentration, during which North America and Europe is being replaced by Asia as the new global leader. In 2014 only 3 countries host 50% of the globally installed bandwidth potential (10 countries almost 75%). The U.S. lost its global leadership in 2011, being replaced by China, which contributes more than twice as much national bandwidth potential in 2014 (29% versus 13%). Despite this bad news about the continuous persistence of the digital access divide among countries, exploratory analysis from a global perspective brings the good news that many more individual people seem to enjoy more equal access to global bandwidth. All of this showcases the urgency to systematically develop indicators to track the digital divide in terms of bandwidth. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper considers how this issue can be addressed. It notes that, if the spectrum assignment in question has no impact on the output of the services competing for it, value generated is unchanged, and the spectrum allocation problem reduces to the minimisation of the aggregate cost of non-spectrum inputs for the relevant services.

QRA has many benefits, such as providing a more complete and nuanced analysis than worst-case assessment; providing a common currency for comparing different hazard types; and providing an objective basis for decision making. As seen in the MetSat case, quantitative risk assessment provides a more complete analysis of risk than using a single scenario worst-case analysis, in this case, combining co-channel, OOBE and ABI hazards in a single assessment. A single consequence metric for all hazards provides a common currency for comparing different hazards.

This exploratory observation study examines how 15 Australian preschool children (aged three to five) used information technologies in their homes to orient themselves in daily life and to solve problems. Children engaged in various ways with the digital technologies available to them and with parents and siblings during play activities. The results explore the value of artistic play, sociodramatic play, and early literacy and numeracy activities in shaping young children's ‘way of life’ and ‘mastery of life’ as outlined in Savolainen's (1995) ELIS model. Observed technology engagement provided an opportunity to explore children's social worlds and the ways that they gathered information during technology play that will inform future learning activities and support child development. By using ELIS theory as an analytic lens, the results demonstrate how children's developmental play with technology tools helps them to internalize social and cultural norms.

An experiment was conducted to test the effects of two psychological constructs in the persuasion process, namely, user's knowledge of and involvement with a literary genre. A novel aspect of the study is that the participants were exposed to reviews contradictory to their initial impression. Contrary to negativity bias widely found in previous studies of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM), a positivity effect of online reviews was found. High and low involvement readers were found to rely on different judgment cues. Furthermore, it is argued that when applied in cultural consumption, the measurement of these constructs demands special treatment because of its “infinite variety” and strong hedonistic character. Involvement at the genre level helped enhance preference stability. However, such effects were not found with users' subjective knowledge at the genre level.

For example, their involvement in research data management (RDM) implies a much deeper relationship with researchers throughout the research lifecycle. Perhaps we are witnessing a shift from support to partnership. This study examines how librarians, IT staff, and research administrators see research and their own relation to it. Within an interpretative methodology, 20 semi-structured interviews with librarians, IT staff, and research administrators were analyzed thematically. Librarians often talked about research via the discourse of research-led teaching. They also conceived of it via notions of collection and to a lesser extent through reference work or copyright expertise. They saw some of their own continuing professional development or service development work as akin to the work of university researchers, but at the other end of a spectrum. Some saw a categorical difference and considered that research was only conducted by people who had a job title of researcher. IT managers tended to see research via infrastructure or specialist expertise. However, at least one IT staff member saw himself as both partly a researcher and a bridge between research and support. Research administrators tended to see research through the roles of administrative support and policy influence. In summary, seven broad narratives about research were identified: influencing researchers to align with policy; being a researcher; being a bridge with research; offering expertise; providing infrastructure; supporting a research/teaching nexus; and relieving researchers of administrative burdens. As institutions develop research partnerships, e.g., around RDM, training and curricula will need to expand existing conceptions and build deeper empathetic relationships with research. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","",""

Introducing university assignments as a contextual construct for disciplinary studies of IL, this study demonstrates how students' and educators' conceptions and experiences of real university assignments and their constructive participation in conceptualization of IL helped to uncover the actual nature of information need in the discipline of geographic information science/systems (GIS) and to gain a better understanding of the concept of, and requirements for, determining information need in this discipline. Adopting an embedded case study design and a participatory approach for fieldwork, the data were mainly gathered from 27 semistructured interviews focused on GIS students' and educators' lived experiences of university assignments and their reflections on various aspects of IL in a master's degree GIS program jointly delivered by universities in the UK and USA. Each learning and teaching experience was treated as a unit of analysis. GIS assignments were found to be geospatial, technology mediated, subject free, and unique in requirements. Each characteristic uncovered a new facet for the concept of information need in GIS.

Farmers relied on informal sources of information, mainly from family, friends, neighbors, extension officers, researchers, and radio. Information that had direct impact on poultry well-being was the most frequently accessed. The major challenges that limited farmers in information seeking were lack of availability of extension officers, lack of awareness, lack of availability of information, lack of electricity, and poor infrastructure.

This study is one of the first to explore the function of the IGF model in a regional context by investigating the impacts of the East African Community's (EAC) East Africa Internet Governance Forum (EAIGF), the first regional IGF established globally. International regime theory, the theory of elite competition, and a modified version of the actor-centered institutionalism model were used to examine the power of stakeholders, including impacts of institutional endowments on stakeholder influence within the EAIGF and impacts of participation in the EAIGF on member country Internet governance tactics. Data were collected through semi-structured in-depth interviews with EAIGF participants, observations of the 2012 EAIGF meeting, and qualitative document analysis of EAIGF documents and related policy documents from EAC member states. Findings reveal the EAIGF promotes capacity building, knowledge sharing, and policy transfer within the region and has contributed to a shift in the balance of power in policymaking processes from state-centric to multistakeholder.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a proxy variable for cloud computing usage - cloud adaptiveness - based on survey panel data from European firms. Observations based on a descriptive analysis suggest three important aspects for further research. First, cloud studies should be conducted at the industry level as cloud computing adaptiveness differs widely across industry sectors. Second, it is important to know what firms do with cloud computing to understand the economic mechanisms and effects triggered by this innovation. And third, cloud adaptiveness is potentially correlated to a firm's position in the supply chain and thus the type of output it produces as well as the market in which it operates.

For this purpose, governments are allocating large parts of the valuable low frequency spectrum to MNOs. This expansion also adds pressure to better optimize the intra-MNO and inter-MNO spectrum usage. Regulators are concerned about problems such as network blackouts, coverage disparities and congestion. Latest technology developments provide new mechanisms to address these problems through two alternative evolution paths, operator-driven and user-driven. The operator-driven path permits operators to trade network capacity and spectrum through, for instance, national roaming and dynamic spectrum access mechanisms, respectively. On the other hand, the user-driven path enables users (and traffic) to rapidly switch between networks through an end-user multihoming mechanism which intensifies retail competition. MNOs are reluctant to adopt these mechanisms if they involve risks. However, regulators can facilitate the deployment of these mechanisms by guiding the level of inter-MNO transaction costs and end-user switching costs. This paper analyzes the market dynamics of these three core mechanisms by employing agent-based modeling. Initial results indicate that each mechanism improves allocative efficiency on a dynamic basis and that such mechanisms become necessary if the current static market model based on vertically integrated MNOs is not able to meet the requirements of service quality, capacity and coverage. One promising use case of the proposed mechanisms is the indoor femto-cellular deployment which suffers from coverage disparity due to static single-MNO base stations. Moreover, either end-user multihoming or national roaming may provide MNOs a feasible business case for building indoor infrastructure by solving coverage disparity problems, by means of competition or cooperation, respectively. Dynamic spectrum access may work as an extension of the previous mechanisms for solving congestion; however, it requires higher technical and business coordination. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

While in Kenya upwards of 50 percent of the population uses mobile payments platforms, in Mexico the proportion is barely above 2 percent. Drawing on interviews and secondary sources, this paper finds that the actors and the politics surrounding diffusion are key to success. Specifically, regulatory capture sheds light on the extent to which a highly regulated financial sector may seek to protect itself from competition from the telecommunication sector via mobile payments regulation they advocate for and even help formulate. In Mexico, the bank-led regulatory model of mobile payments has limited the diffusion of the service to the unbanked population because of regulatory capture by the banking industry. In Kenya, by contrast, the Mobile Network Operator (MNO)-led model has resulted in much higher rates of diffusion and reflects the extent to which telecommunications firms have played a decisive role in designing the regulatory regime and the limiting the impact of financial industry capture in that country. The implications for policymaking and regulation are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bank-led; Financial inclusion; MNO-led; Mobile money; Mobile payments; Mobile payments; Unbanked",""

We examine the impact of service- and facility-based competition on firm-level investment as well as the strategic effects underlying infrastructure investment decisions. At the same time we explicitly model the structural dynamics of broadband investment by means of a flexible accelerator model. The empirical specification employs dynamic panel estimation techniques which allow us to account for various sources of endogeneity. We find that facility-based competition exerts a positive and significant impact on both incumbents and entrants implying that incumbents’ and entrants’ investment decisions are strategic complements. Moreover, we find that intermodal competition in terms of fixed-mobile substitution exerts different effects at the firm level. Finally, we show that service-based competition appears to have no significant impact on the investment decision of incumbents and entrants. However, with respect to the later phase of market liberalization, service-based competition exerts a negative impact on entrants’ investment. Our results thus also provide relevant policy guidance on the role of service-based competition in regulating emerging high-speed broadband infrastructure. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Facility-based competition; Investment dynamics; Regulation; Service-based competition; Strategic effects",""

The objective of the study was to identify consumer preferences for the following characteristics of mobile plans: the importance of using the same provider as friends and family (calling club network effects), the market share of the provider (pure network effects), the length of the commitment period, monthly fee/recharge obligations and per minute call charges for calls made within and outside the provider network. A discrete choice experiment was used as a preference elicitation method and implemented in face-to-face interviews. We present results regarding willingness to pay for the described features as well as their relationship to socio-demographic variables. Consumers are willing to pay 1.3 Euro per month more to reduce the commitment period from 1 year to 6 months and willing to pay 2.5 euros per month more to be part of a larger network. Consumers are also twice as much more sensitive to within-network price variations than extra-network price variations. These results remain unchanged in the sub-sample of those that have internet access suggesting that a web-based surveys are capable of producing unbiased results.

New mobile technologies in the market offer enhanced voice capability, high-speed data service, and expanded service coverage. In India, the spread of second-generation mobile technologies - global system for mobile (GSM) and code division multiple access (CDMA) - has led to a dramatic rise in teledensity, from approximately 1% in 1985 to 76.86% in 2011. This presents an interesting opportunity to study the competitive effects of the two technologies. In this paper, we analyze the effect of a new technology (CDMA) on an existing technology's (GSM) diffusion process and vice versa using an epidemic diffusion model that incorporates the competition effect. The results showed that the diffusion of CDMA was faster than that of GSM in India and CDMA diffusion had a positive effect on GSM. Further, despite competition, GSM continues to remain the dominant mobile technology in India. These findings offer useful insights into the diffusion process of mobile telephony in countries with multiple technology standards.

Increased ICT investment explains an important part of the acceleration of economic growth in the United States since 1995. An objective of this study is to verify if the same happened in Latin America. The analysis is presented at two levels. First, the study takes into account the aggregate level of the economy, for a set of 18 countries in the region. Second, it analyzes the relationship of ICT, economic growth and productivity by sector in five countries, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, which are part of a project on sectoral growth analysis using a growth accounting approach (LA-KLEMS project). The decomposition of the factors that determine the gap in GDP per capita with the US showed that improvements in the labor factor have helped to reduce the gap in GDP per capita relative to the US and conversely poor labor productivity has contributed negatively. The main cause that the labor productivity gap remains is the widening gap in ICT capital that counteracts improvements in human capital in Latin America. The role of ICT has been very low, representing less than one sixth of the total capital contribution. The analysis by economic activity, using the LA-KLEMS data base for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, shows that the contribution of capital is the main source of growth in the fastest growing industry, the transportation industry and communications, and went hand in hand with high investment especially in ICT. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A MMP is capable of offering great utilities to its users and content providers (CPs) because such parties do not need to access multiple Internet media platforms to find their trading partners. However, a MMP operator (MMPO) can have a significant negative impact upon social welfare whenever it attempts to maximize profits via abuses of its own monopolistic power. The aims of this paper are as follows: firstly, we construct a model of a monopolistic media platform market to identify and analyze the decisions of a MMPO based on two-sided market theory. Secondly, we demonstrate how three factors – matching technology, prosumer strategy and advertising technology – impact on the size of the network and social welfare. Finally, we provide both policy makers and media platform operators (MPOs) with useful suggestions on how to promote the Internet media industry and deter MMPOs from abusing their own powers. From the analysis of the modified new model we suggest, matching technology and prosumer policy are demonstrated to increase the number of users and CPs of the platform and increase social welfare. Advertising policy is also one way of increasing social welfare, however, the necessity of monitoring of government for MMPO is proven because it may harm the utility of users. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Advertising; Media platform; Prosumer; Technology; Two-sided market",""

Generally speaking, China's telecommunications development has been driven by investments from government-allied entities and features a strong industrial policy. However, the Chinese government has chosen a somewhat soft-intervention approach in broadband development and relied on the market itself to grow by creating a competitive market structure. As the market has recently evolved to a certain degree of saturation, there is a seemingly shift of emphasis in China's broadband policy from infrastructure buildup and service provision to application creation and user demand stimulation. However, China's broadband future is uncertain due to unsettled but important institutional and financial issues. Policy changes appear not to keep up with the broadband ecosystem evolution. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Broadband; China; Ecosystem; Policy",""

Using firm level data and instrumental variable estimation strategy, it finds that the relationship is inverted-U shaped. The investment maximising intensity of competition is reached when operators' gross profits represent 37 or 40 per cent of their revenues, depending on whether capital expenditures are normalised by the number of subscribers. This finding means that investment increases with competition as long as operators' profits are above the thresholds of 37 or 40 per cent of their revenues. Under these thresholds, there is a tradeoff between competition and investment.

The impact of ICT on economic growth is analyzed via two main channels. The direct contribution of ICT investment to aggregate economy and manufacturing growth, and the indirect impact of ICT on Total Factor Productivity Growth (TFPG) in ICT using and ICT producing sectors. The results suggest an increasing role of ICT investment in driving aggregate economic growth in India, though largely limited to the service sector. Moreover, the economy has not been successful in spreading the ICT spillover effect across the board, thus limiting the productivity gain from ICT use. Whereas we see an improving productivity growth in ICT using market services and their contribution to aggregate productivity growth, the manufacturing sectors lags quite behind.

Regardless whether the investment sharing agreement occurs, market exclusion of the facility-based outsider does not hold. Considering the prevalence of the investment sharing agreement, it is not necessarily true that each insider contributes with an investment share of 50% since there may exist a trade-off between bargaining power and investment participation. Although full integration avoids duplication of investment costs, social welfare may be higher under partial integration. Presuming the increasing run for fiber, the framework proposes the inclusion of a fourth service-based operator that requires access to the fiber network infrastructure held by the consortium. This may define a tight oligopoly with simultaneous presence of investment sharing agreement. The service-based outsider is excluded from the retail market when the wholesale access price is unregulated. Subsequently, market exclusion depends on the competitive nature of the outsider firm. Finally, the framework reveals the conditions that legitimize ex-post regulation of the wholesale access price of fiber. An asymmetric regulatory intervention at the wholesale access price level is justified as a means of improving social welfare if the investment effort is excessively high. The same applies if the investment effort is intermediate, provided that an excessively high gap exists between the vertical spillover that affects the fiber consortium in relation to the vertical spillover that affects the cable operator. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Access price regulation; Basic investment sharing agreements; Exclusion",""

However, there are some particular features of Luxembourg's ‘informed follower’ mode of market liberalisation, which are sociospatially distinct and therefore warrant investigation. In particular, the government of Luxembourg has sought to proactively intervene in the direct provision of telecommunications services, in the form of two competing but 100% state-owned operators, whilst simultaneously supporting market liberalisation. An understanding of the role of the state in this process is clarified through the conceptual lens of the state as policy-maker, regulator and operator. Through examining the multiple roles performed by the Luxembourgish state in the wider context of the EU telecommunications reform packages, the paper reveals the competitive tension that exists between each of the different arms of the state, that is, between POST and Luxconnect.

For futuristic cognitive radio (CR) based applications and communication networks, white space detection plays an important role. In fact, the proper white space understanding is a prerequisite for effective communication in support of a wide range of information technology systems. Moreover, by clearly defining the white space, the business and technical scenarios for white space usage can be clearly defined and their implementation will be simplified. Also, the decisions of regulatory bodies and telecommunications policy makers for auctions of particular spectrum bands can be facilitated by a thorough white space understanding. White space detection is a critical aspect of Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) which ultimately can help in overcoming bandwidth shortages. A major portion of the DSA research to date has been limited to the dimensions of time, frequency, and geographical location while neglecting other perspectives for the detection of white spaces. Generally, what exactly is a white space and how do white spaces differ in various modern contexts of wireless networks? This paper strives to answer these questions by reviewing the conventional white space definitions and exploring advanced perspectives on white spaces that can be used for CR communications.

Through a two-year ethnographic analysis comprising archives analysis, participant-observation, and 31 interviews, the data revealed that the forum's structure illustrated characteristics of a community of practice (CoP), a construct that has rarely been used in examining online health communities. Newcomers began as legitimate peripheral participants who progressed through the community from being novices, to novice/mentors, to mentor/experts. This progression represented a cycle of identification with three phases: a) an introductory phase, where novices made themselves known to the community and began to wrestle with breast cancer; b) learning the community's social practices and building identity as they evolved into novice/mentors who became more knowledgeable; and c) becoming mentor/experts who were looked up to and could provide information and support to others. Attaining mentor/expert status indicated a completion of the cycle in that mentor/experts were identified as being central to the community, and were also participating in the introduction phase by welcoming novices.

According to the Recommendation, in order to reconcile investment and competition, wholesale prices should have nonlinear characteristics and only partly vary by the number of accesses. It demonstrates that a cost standard for the economic replicability test, which implies fully fixed and variable cost recovery for the access seeker, including the total wholesale price, would be incompatible with the economics of NGA networks and that such a test would deter NGA investment. Therefore, the cost standard should include only the variable part of the wholesale price. However, this paper underlines that during a transition phase, until competitors have secured access to NGA infrastructure, a second temporary test called the ""competition migration test"" should be added to ensure incumbent NGA retail prices do not foreclose efficient copper-based entrants. The two proposed tests surpass the limits of the ""ladder of investment"" theory by including the ""business migration effect"" developed by Bourreau, Cambini, and Dogan (2012). © 2015 The Authors.","Margin squeeze test; Next-generation access networks; Regulation",""

In this paper, we reviewed the literature on the motives behind the consumer's decision to purchase a bundle and found that holistic frameworks of purchasing factors, especially in bundle purchasing, are rare. To reach a more comprehensive framework, we examined the bundle purchasing process through an empirical study that incorporates old and new elements in the purchasing of bundled services. Starting with the customer's concerns in the purchasing process, we widened the scope to include considerations of usage convenience and life-cycle costs related to bundles, and we covered various other potential open question specific to bundling. By means of exploratory factor analysis, following the K-1 rule, we extracted eight factors and gave them preliminary names. Moreover, we conducted a linear regression analysis on how these eight factors influence the customer's willingness to buy a bundle service. Therefore, these factors can serve as a framework for further studies on the bundle purchasing process. In this paper, we also discussed newly discovered emotional factors affecting the purchasing process. In particular, usage convenience and self-image seem to be self-standing factors affecting the willingness to buy.

Based on these dimensions we articulate four ideal types of discourse that permeate ICT and development efforts: stakeholder-based discourses that emphasize consensus, networked efforts among actors collaborating in network arrangements, mobilization discourses that account for contestation over meanings of participation, and oppositional discourses from ׳grassroots׳ actors that also include conflict.

This article analyzes two potential competition problems in online social networks from a legal perspective. Attention is paid to the extent to which switching costs and network effects give rise to data portability and social network interoperability issues. It is discussed whether competition enforcement or newly devised regulation may serve to resolve these potential competition issues. A comparison is made with the telecommunication sector where similar concerns were addressed by way of regulation imposing obligations of number portability and network interoperability on all market players. Because of this similarity, it is worth considering if any lessons can be drawn from the regulatory approach applied in telecommunications for online social networking. The fact that the portability and interoperability issues in social networks relate to personal data and not 'merely' to technology like in the telecommunication sector, leads to additional considerations in the data protection regime. As a result, data protection concerns also have to be taken into account when devising remedies for the online social network industry. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Competition law; Data portability; Interoperability; Network effects; Online social networks; Switching costs",""

These individuals are able to make voice calls and browse the Internet with the same mobile device. Hence, for mobile network operators (MNOs) the question to what extent mobile Internet (MI) use substitutes or supplements or does not affect established mobile voice (MV) calling gains economic relevance. Unfortunately, the literature on usage interdependencies between these two mobile communication service categories is scarce. Therefore, this study examines the relationship between the monthly number of outgoing MV minutes and monthly MI data traffic in a sample of 11,614 residential postpaid subscribers over 25 months from October 2011 to October 2013. Actual consumption and customer data was extracted from the billing system of the German subsidiary of a multinational MNO. Multi-level analysis of the time-varying and -constant study variables reveals large heterogeneity between sample subjects with regard to their MI-MV associations. At the mean/median monthly level, the demand for conventional MV telephony decreases within the time window under investigation. However, for the majority of customers the relationship between the usage of the two service categories is complementary. Subscribers who are most likely to replace at least some of their MV minutes by MI traffic (1) are heavy MV users in the initial period (October 2011), (2) are heavy SMS users within the time window under study, (3) are male, (4) are older, (5) have a longer tenure with the MNO, (6) have not opted for a MV flat rate, (7) started operating their current handset more recently and (8) are currently not equipped with an Apple iPhone. Implications of the findings for MNO strategies seeking to respond to market changes and for future research are discussed. This study contributes to the literature regarding substitution, reinforcement or neutral effects of MI usage on established mobile communication services. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

If is found that China has fared well in some projects (usually at the construction or technical level) while encountered difficulties in some others (at semantic, service, and even higher levels), due to variance in the enforceability of differing institutional arrangements. China has arguably succeeded, at best, in the supply-side (""access"" level) of the rural informatization ecosystem; this is partly because that the Chinese model has emphasized primarily on the formal side of institutions but considerably less so on the informal side. Accordingly, factors contributing to implementation success have, path-dependently, highlighted the functioning of regulative institutions but considerably less so of the normative-cognitive institutions.

The results illustrate that a group focusing on an iOS platform achieves a high average efficiency with low variance within the group because the iOS ecosystem manages the content novelty and uncertainty risk in the selection process. This quality control enables a CP to maximize value once the CP enters the ecosystem. From the meta-frontier viewpoint, however, Android-group firms have a higher efficiency level than iOS-group firms. Android transfers risk management to CPs who can conduct additional trial and error, causing CPs to endure the tough selection process. This explains the low initial technical efficiency, but in the long term, this group has the potential to achieve high efficiency. In addition, the group providing content to both platforms was the most efficient group because of the economies of scale. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A close historical analysis reveals that this seemingly unprofitable rural informatization service was originally conceived by competing carriers as a marketing strategy to gain a competitive advantage in less lucrative markets. However, when the government decided to promulgate such an informatization program nationwide, the business practice turned into one of the carrier׳s de facto obligations.

While EU's regulatory policy towards NGA originally has been falling somewhere between the first two, the recent developments affirm the influence of long-standing conventional approach over the emerging NGA platforms, and related competition and investment strategies. While US experience clearly exhibits full deregulation, some other countries' (e.g., Turkey, Brazil) NGA policy decisions represent an approach corresponding to the third category in general. This study mainly focuses on the EU's regulatory history from the beginning till its current NGA strategy under the light of 2010 and 2013 Recommendations with an emphasis on recent pricing policy adopted by the latter. In the paper, after examining EU regulatory perspective and broadband market indicators in general, 'ladder of investment' theory which has driven growth of EU investment policies, was found having limited success and stuck to LLU rung. This study, putting an emphasis to 2020 Digital Agenda targets, focuses on price-based investment trade-offs, and in lieu of such trade-off policies proposes larger scale optimisation displacing the historical regulatory access and pricing schemes that are vulnerable and exposed to regulatory commitment and dynamic consistency problems. It is considered that rather than 2013 Recommendation's way of fine-tuning over conventional wisdom of regulation, an overhaul consisting of some elements derivable from regulatory holiday - as is found preferable to full deregulation - is applicable under certain conditions, particularly symmetric obligations for sharing civil engineering infrastructure. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Competition; Deregulation; EU regulatory framework; European Commission; Investment; NGA; Regulation; Regulatory holiday",""

The proposed tool provides useful suggestions about what information to include in newly created records. Thus, it assists catalogers with their task, as they are typically unfamiliar with the heterogeneous nature of the incoming material. The suggester tool applies case-based reasoning to generate suggestions taken from material previously cataloged in the SciELO scientific electronic library.

The tool has been evaluated through a human-subject study with catalogers and through an automatic test using a collection consisting of 5742 training examples and 120 test cases from 12 different subject areas. In both experiments the system has shown very good performance. These evaluations indicate that the use of case-based reasoning provides a powerful alternative to traditional ways of identifying subject areas and keywords in library resources. In addition, a heuristic evaluation of the tool was carried out by taking as a starting point the Sirius heuristic-based framework, resulting in a very good score.

As an example of this development, public and university libraries are studied from the point of view of teleworking. Although work still only accounts for a small amount of the activities that take place in libraries, its transformations can be seen as a 'weak signal' of newly emerging spatial arrangements. In addition to the home and workplace, teleworkers are using a network of public, semi-public and private spaces (so-called third places) for different types of working. The research used the concept ""spatial portfolio"" to address this phenomenon of spatial modalities. The new role of public libraries within this context is discussed. In addition to their traditional functions of lending books and providing spaces for reading newspapers and magazines, libraries are now becoming more multifunctional, providing space for different activities, including work. This new phenomenon has been studied empirically by conducting a qualitative interview and observing teleworkers in two public libraries and one university library in the City of Helsinki, Finland. The objective was to find and analyze different profiles of workers in libraries, thus providing input for future planning and design of these spaces, as well as the urban fabric around them. The results show that a considerable range of activities within research and education, art and culture, information technology, business and finance, and social services and government are performed in the libraries, all of which are in part supported by the new concepts and policies of the city. Libraries can be seen as 'transitory workspaces' where people work at least a couple of hours per week and for different reasons such as free wifi connection and location. Also, libraries might be considered 'spatial incubators' or rather places able to attract people who start up their own activities.

The consequences of this divergence are profound. As technology transitions within the public switched telecommunications network proceed, the U.S. imposes fewer obligations on broadband and Internet service providers and provides a much-diminished level of consumer protection relative to that in Canada. The role of differing administrative procedures and policymaking forums is an important factor contributing to recent policy divergence. Historical analysis also reveals the importance of the role of path dependence from some early differences in U.S. and Canadian policy choices made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These differences in early policy choices emerged from (1) differences in federalism structures between the U.S. and Canada; (2) negation of Bell patents in Canada that triggered an earlier era of telephony competition as well as both federal and provincial policy experimentation; and (3) AT&T's unique public relations campaign of regulated monopoly developed in the U.S. in response to this earlier policy experimentation in Canada. AT&T's public relations campaign has induced a false memory in the U.S. - not found in Canada - as to the origins of regulated monopoly for telephony. This false memory has contributed to the efficacy of telecommunications carriers' false monopoly theory argument - that their historical duties have been based on the existence of monopoly, and thus are not applicable in a competitive environment - which has and continues to distort telecommunications policy development in the U.S. including the network neutrality debate. Yet, telecommunications carriers' dual status as common carriers and public utilities under the common law has created confusion in both the U.S. and Canada. This confusion has created a tendency to misattribute the duty to serve to the existence of monopoly, providing a different - although still historically flawed - basis for asserting a monopoly theory argument for the purpose of eliminating regulation. This confusion, however, is more easily corrected in Canada where there was no comparable public relations campaign of regulated monopoly for proponents of deregulation to leverage. The resonance of early policy differences between the U.S. and Canada illustrates the complexity of pursuing telecommunications policy debates within multi-jurisdictional legal frameworks - a challenge that the European Union currently faces in developing a Telecommunications Single Market. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Broadband; Common carrier; Deregulation; Federalism; Internet protocol; Monopoly; Path dependence; Policy experimentation; Public relations; Public utility",""

One of the interesting characteristics of the Chinese market, for both academicians and practitioners, is that, although m-payment evolved from the convergence of payment and telecommunication industries (traditionally dominated by state-owned enterprises in China), it was private, third party payment companies that developed m-payment platforms, which gained a competitive edge over state-owned enterprises. While standardization, regulation and policy play an important role in stimulating the Chinese m-payment market, these factors alone are not sufficient to establish a sustainable two-sided market and generate a critical mass of merchants and end-users. Although merchants play a crucial role in the m-payment ecosystem, there is a lack of insight into merchant behavior, and their interaction with other actors in the m-payment ecosystem. In this study, we propose a framework for the analyses of the m-payment ecosystem. Starting from a set of propositions, we conducted in-depth interviews to analyze the multifaceted nature of the Chinese m-payment market. We identified the connection between the adoption process and the business ecosystem configurations. The proposed framework can be used as a basis for future studies of complex business ecosystems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, relatively few studies examine the mechanisms by which spatial inequality explains the existing digital divide in a developing country. Applying the normalisation and stratification thesis in diffusion theory, this study examines the ways in which spatial inequality is related to the Internet divide in Indonesia, a developing country that is currently growing in its use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), but that has experienced unequal regional development in the last three decades. Data comes from the Indonesian national socio-economic survey (Susenas) 2010–2012, which comprises 3.3 million individuals, 750,000 households and 292 districts. Far from moving towards convergence, the Internet divide expanded during this period; the inequality of Internet access by age, gender, income, and education deepens and widens across urban–rural, city–countryside, and remote island–mainland island areas. The results of analyses using both stratified and multilevel models indicate that supply factors across districts – particularly district disparities in telecommunications infrastructures, human capital and education services – are associated with the Internet divide. The results are robust against individual, household and district socio-economic characteristics associated with the Internet divide. Enlarging the distribution of telecommunication infrastructures and education facilities, particularly across districts in rural, countryside and remote islands, may thus help to bridge the Internet divide in Indonesia. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Indonesia; Internet divide; Spatial inequality",""

To maximize consumer surplus and profit of Internet service provider at the same time, it is necessary to investigate the consumeŕs willingness to pay for a given quality of service (QoS) level. This study investigates consumer preferences for Internet access services that provide different levels of QoS for different applications. We collect stated preference data via conjoint analysis method and estimate consumer preference using mixed logit model. Based on the estimation results, we find that consumers react most sensitively to changes in the quality of the web browsing service among internet access services and have the highest marginal willingness to pay for improvements in the quality of this service. On the other hand, marginal willingness to pays are relatively low for voice over IP (VoIP) and IP television (IPTV), which are sensitive to latency time. However, if service users of VoIP/IPTV are separated from non-users or if it is assumed that there is no substitute for VoIP and IPTV, marginal willingness to pays of VoIP and IPTV increase. It implies that Internet service providers can profit by providing high QoS to VoIP and IPTV as the markets for VoIP and IPTV services mature and user numbers increase. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study applied a customer satisfaction index (CSI) model to the smart mobile sector in order to derive a smart-service CSI (SCSI). The SCSI model and its hypotheses were then tested using partial least square analysis and index calculation. The findings showed that the perceived value and customer satisfaction are key variables mediating the relationship between quality and customer loyalty. The proposed model demonstrated strong explanatory power, with satisfactory reliability and validity. The SCSI model establishes a foundation for future smart service categories on the basis of providing a powerful tool for quality assessment.

This situation has generated important anticompetitive concerns, leading some authorities to contemplate (and even impose) a ban on such practice. In this paper I propose a model of the mobile industry to simulate the short-run welfare impact of this regulatory intervention. This ban will force the market to offer prices that do not depend on what network the call is terminated thereby increasing current on-net prices and decreasing current off-net prices. Thus, the short-run effect of the policy, for both consumers and producers, is a priori ambiguous. The model simulates how consumer and producer welfare would be affected under various scenarios for the ex-post undifferentiated (average market) price. Importantly, the model allows policy makers to determine the maximum ex-post undifferentiated market price that would guarantee no welfare loss. I illustrate the model using results from Chile where the competition authority recently banned this practice; using firms' actual choices of undifferentiated post-ban prices in the market (together with the corresponding observed call volumes) and the model results lead the analysis to the conclusion that in this particular case this regulatory intervention has (in the short-run) likely harmed consumers and benefited firms.

From the literature review, it is anticipated that the use of both media can positively effect social capital and civic participation, which are essential for an efficient recovery. However, as this can be questioned it is important to understand and demonstrate how media can affect people's perception and behaviour in post-disaster recovery, especially considering the current complex media environment. The two media in consideration are very different, but at the same time are highly intertwined. Currently, few previous studies on this question can be found because suitable case studies limited as nature disaster of such a scale rarely occur and the media environment is rapidly changing. This study proposes a two-model approach to examine the effects of ICT and mass media in post-disaster recovery from two different perspectives in media studies: the active and passive audience perspectives. Using data collected from the three prefectures that were directly hit by the disaster, the results of the two models demonstrate a consistent pattern that the use of both ICT and mass media can create positive effects in post-disaster recovery. They increase the level of social capital through building bonding trust, network bridging and civic participation, as well as increase a person's intention to participate in post-disaster related activities. Thus, it can now be argued that both ICT and mass media can have positively contributed to the recovery. These findings have important implications for NGOs as well as policy makers that are working on the recovery. The two models also serve as the foundation for future studies that would further explore the underlying mechanisms of the media's effect and role in post-disaster recovery. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Great East Japan Earthquake; ICT media; Mass media; Post-disaster recovery; Social capital; Social media",""

This article describes the use of participatory design, a method commonly used in human-computer interaction (HCI), for investigating design and deployment challenges to create a new hybrid question-answer (Q&A) system. A set of three design sessions was conducted with 17 experts from academia and industry. These semi-guided discussions asked the experts for their opinions and suggestions on various issues concerning what a potential hybrid Q&A system could look like. In addition, the participants were encouraged to provide design and implementation ideas based on expertise in their relative fields. The suggestions, comments, and ideas resulted in the development of 11 themes within three categories: (1) provision of more information; (2) provision of control; and (3) focus on user-friendly design. This paper provides details of the method, the sessions, and the design suggestions including the 11 themes and three broad categories. The paper provides a synthesis of the implications of the findings for virtual reference and social Q&A service providers and system designers.

A methodology that can analyse the effectiveness of the digital services provided by public organizations is proposed. The methodology was applied to the digital services provided by the Municipal Library of Prague (MLP). This methodology allows comparison of the effectiveness of the different services provided. This contributes to the effectiveness of the decisions of public representatives and overall social effectiveness of the digital services provided. The results show that the effectiveness of digital services (provided by remote access) at the MLP in 2012 is 4.02 (this means that each unit of financial investment brings benefits in the amount of 4.02 units). In contrast, digital services provided directly in the library have a very low effectiveness, i.e. 1:0.89, thus they are clearly ineffective. In addition, when compared to all the services that are provided, digital services have the highest effectiveness of all.

Using “before and after” studies we attempt to identify and understand mechanisms through which ICT (and broadband, in particular), may have an impact on poverty alleviation. Using a combination of the Capabilities Approach and Livelihoods Perspective, this research shows that mobile broadband access (as opposed to fixed shared access) and effective training through the role of infomediaries enables low-income communities to develop new skills, to engage in new practices and to find useful applications for old and new abilities, needs and interests. A specific finding that has not received attention in the literature is the productive role of immediate family members as infomediaries; the weight of family networks plays a crucial role in learning about ICTs. These networks fuel a sense of confidence required to handle knowledge and practices that are initially alien in this sector.

G.fast is a copper-based access technology that can, in theory, provide a combined downstream and upstream transmission capacity of up to 1 Gbps over a distance of 100 m. In this article, we analyse the cost of fibre to the distribution point (FTTdp) with G.fast and assess the cost reductions that can be achieved in comparison with FTTH networks. Two types of FTTdp networks have been employed: fibre to the building (FTTdp-Building) and fibre to the street (FTTdp-Street). The results show that, for all the network scenarios studied, the cost of a home passed for FTTH and FTTdp-Building is the same, but the cost of a home passed for FTTdp-Street is on average 17.2% lower than the cost for FTTH. Regarding the cost per home connected, the usage of FTTdp-Building and FTTdp-Street leads to average cost reductions compared with FTTH of 1.1% and 10.8%, respectively. The cost reductions achieved when employing FTTdp are higher in urban areas than in suburban and rural areas. Several measures could be taken by policymakers to promote the deployment of FTTdp networks that work with G.fast: these include the coordination of frequency bands to avoid the interference of G.fast with very high speed digital subscriber line 2 (VDSL2) equipment and the speeding up of permissions for the installation of FTTdp equipment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Copper; Cost; FTTdp; FTTH; G.fast",""

Thus, academic librarians have expressed concern about the under-utilization of resources provided through library Web portals. Studies of technology acceptance and success indicate that user training can positively influence individuals' use of information systems. Even so, there has been no investigation of the longterm effects of user education on the use of library Web portals. This longitudinal study fills this gap in the literature by determining whether a semester-long, credit-bearing, general education course integrated with an information literacy component positively alters undergraduate students' perceptions and increases their use of the university libraries' web portal at a mid-size research institution. A mixed methods approach was employed, collecting data through three rounds of survey (pre-course, post-course, and follow-up) as well as one-on-one interviews. Results from the quantitative analysis indicated variance in participants' perceptions and use of the libraries' portal from the short-term to a longer term.

Although a majority of LIS faculty considers OA journals to be comparable to traditional journals, a sizable minority remains unconvinced of the purported benefits of open-access journals.

Higher education institutions have to understand the Internet information-seeking behaviors of students and how they perceive electronic resources in order to effectively fulfill their mission of equipping students with relevant and contemporary knowledge and skills. The influence of four background variables (gender, level of study, enrollment status, and field of study) was examined in the analysis of data from 900 students at one Croatian university. The results show that students mostly use Wikipedia and similar online resources, as well as university websites, including websites of university libraries. The level and field of study are strong predictors of differences in the frequency of use of certain Internet sources. Factor analysis revealed four factors: tendency to use, advantages of using, incentives and reasons for using, and prerequisites for using electronic resources. These factors represent the underlying constructs by which students' perceptions of electronic resources can be classified. The findings further indicate that students only slightly prefer electronic over printed resources, although they highly value the benefits of the use of electronic formats. In addition, it has been revealed that students believe that they are well equipped and possess competencies for the effective use of electronic resources.

Using the theory of work values, job satisfaction of information professionals working in academic, special, public and school libraries as well as in archives and private companies is examined. Data were obtained through a questionnaire distributed to different types of information organizations. The results showed that the information professionals were satisfied with their jobs. Job satisfaction was predicted by intrinsic work values, namely the opportunities for learning, expression of creativity, autonomy, use of knowledge and abilities, and adoption of innovative technological developments. The analysis also indicated significant differences in the sources of job satisfaction (extrinsic, social and prestige work values) among professionals employed in four types of information organizations (academic libraries, public libraries, special libraries and archives). Professionals in special libraries were more satisfied with extrinsic work values than those in public libraries and archives. Professionals working in public libraries were more satisfied with prestige work values than those employed in academic libraries and archives. Finally, it was indicated that professionals in archives were less satisfied with social work values than their colleagues in public and special libraries. A relationship between job satisfaction and years of experience was also examined. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","",""

Thus, measuring the countries information development can gain numerous benefits since comparisons and rankings create a major challenge for countries' further advancement and development. The aim of this paper is multiple. It firstly elaborates the term of the information society and examines countries' ICT development. Secondly, it debates on the importance of measurement and ranking, emphasizing the methods of measuring the information society. It reviews the ICT Development Index (IDI) as one of these methods, pointing to its drawbacks. The disadvantages of the IDI are mostly related to its bias and uncertainty. This paper accentuates the importance of the stability and objectiveness of a measurement method, and for this reason it presents the Composite I-distance Indicator (CIDI) methodology for measuring countries' ICT development that overcomes these drawbacks. In the case study, we analysed a dataset of 157 countries. The results presented in this study clearly indicate that the CIDI ranking methodology is unbiased and more stable than the official IDI ranking methodology, and can be used as an appropriate framework for information society evaluation measurement. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","CIDI methodology; Composite indicators; I-distance method; ICT Development Index (IDI); Information and Communication Technologies (ICT); Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis",""

Based on the theory of planned behavior, a research model focusing on beliefs, attitudes, norms, and resource factors was proposed. The research model was tested with a total of 1298 responses from a national survey in the United States (US). The data analysis results, using the partial least squares (PLS) technique, show that attitudinal beliefs (including perceived career benefit, risk, and perceived effort), disciplinary norms, and perceived availability of data repositories all have significant impacts on STEM researchers' attitudes toward data sharing, and further, both the attitude toward data sharing and the availability of data repositories have strong influences on researchers' data sharing behaviors. These results demonstrate that the theory of planned behavior is a useful theoretical framework for explaining STEM researchers' data sharing behaviors. From the practical perspective, this research suggests that information professionals can better serve STEM researchers by allocating their efforts in two ways: (1) Providing appropriate data services and tools to reduce researchers' efforts involved in data sharing, and (2) providing data repositories to facilitate researchers' data sharing behaviors. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","",""

Academic libraries and librarians have taken the lead in the development of information literacy programmes. Whilst there has been much sharing of good practise, there has been less consideration of alternative models of the outcomes of information literacy programmes. To contribute to addressing this gap, this article reports on an evaluation of student peer delivery of an information literacy scheme in the specific context of a medical and health information portal. The Student Champion Scheme (SCS) is an initiative designed to promote the use of a national specialist health and social care information portal, Evidence Search, amongst students in the health professions, and thereby to further embed evidence-based practise. The SCS run by NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, UK), uses a model of training, in which student champions are first trained by NICE staff, and then the champions train their peers. This study evaluates the scheme on the basis of secondary data gathered by NICE during the evaluation processes associated with two annual cycles of the SCS, together with focus groups with champions, and interviews with prospective university-based co-facilitators of the scheme. Findings suggest that the scheme is successful in promoting use of the portal, Evidence Search, and in developing advocates amongst champions. The evaluation offers a range of insights into the benefits and challenges associated with such a scheme, whose interest and implications extend beyond this specific scheme. To be successful the quality of peer training and peers' identification with and belief in the value of both the training they deliver, and specific information sources is pivotal. In addition, training is strengthened by contributions from librarians and academics, and a climate in which all participants are clear about their specific contribution. It is recommended that academic libraries should seek to develop a range of differentiated information literacy programmes, each with specific objectives, to suit different audiences, and undertake regular evaluation as a basis for improvement and innovation. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","",""

Using a dataset collected from 48 participants searching on four tasks, this study examined these questions while also validating the task difficulty reason scheme. Results suggest that the 19 difficulty reasons elicited after a search task are rarely correlated, and are, instead, independent. Several difficulty reasons, such as “task requirements too specific” and “low topic knowledge,” contribute significantly to difficulty levels.

The findings demonstrate significant regional variations in accessibility that have been persistent over time and cannot be explained by simple population distribution measures alone. Distances to the nearest public library are higher in the South compared to other regions, with statistically significant clusters of states with lower accessibility than average. The national average population-weighted distance to the nearest public library is 2.1 miles. While this supports the use of a two-mile buffer employed in many LIS studies to measure library service areas, the degree of variation that exists between regions and states suggests that local measures should be applied to local areas. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","",""

These businesses create value by bringing advertisers and users together. Access to user data is critical to this process. On the basis of economic literature, the features of multi-sided platforms will be discussed. It will be argued that the characteristics of multi-sided platforms increase the likelihood that successful companies become dominant due to the existence of indirect network effects. In these circumstances, dominant platforms may foreclose competition by raising barriers to entry in the large collections of user data. This may give rise to access problems for competitors and new entrants that need access to data gathered by dominant platforms in order to provide competing or complementary services. A comparative legal analysis will be used to assess the standards that are applicable in the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) for finding liability for refusals to deal under antitrust or competition law. The private antitrust cases that have already occurred regarding access to user data in the US show that the scope of applicability of the US essential facilities doctrine is very limited after the judgment of the Supreme Court in Trinko. Although the European Commission and the European Court of Justice seem to be willing to accept liability for a refusal to deal more easily than their US counterparts, high legal hurdles still have to be met under the essential facilities doctrine in the EU. Nevertheless, there are scenarios in which liability for refusals to give access to data will likely be accepted in the EU. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Access regulation; E-commerce platforms; Essential facilities; Multi-sided platforms; Online social networks; Search engines; User data",""

Comparing existing business models in the three countries, we argue that regulation has affected both the industry structure and the vertical linkages of the different participants in the mobile payments ecosystem. We predict that rather than converging onto the mobile payment models of Japan or South Korea, the Chinese mobile payment industry is likely to see the coexistence of competing business models in the intermediate term.

Determining the right price is a central challenge in this context. Despite known limitations, the Contingent Valuation (CV) method, which elicits information on the Willingness to Pay (WTP), is a useful guide to pricing decisions. The present study draws on data generated using the CV method to examine whether mobile use is sensitive to small declines in the current per-minute price of use for low income households in six countries of Asia: Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. A Heckman model is used to correct for the sample selection problem arising from the study of mobile phone owners alone. We find that demographic criteria, including income, are not significant in explaining whether usage is responsive to price fall, although they appear important in determining mobile phone ownership. Instead, subscription to multiple service providers has an important association with the price sensitivity of use: Those with multiple SIM cards are likely to increase usage when price falls whereas those who report that they would not switch service providers are unlikely to do so. The study further finds that consumption would increase among those with a more diversified use of mobile services (to participate in competitions and to access government services) and among more ׳limited’ users (those who attach a greater importance to the emergency uses of the phone). Overall the findings suggest that there exists a latent demand for mobile minutes among low income households that can be tapped through a small reduction in price. However, given the relatively low profit margins in these markets and the ability of users to switch between service providers quickly and at low cost, competing on price could threaten the long term survival of firms. Non-price strategies would therefore be important for firm survival and sustainable service delivery. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Asia; Economic development; Information and Communication  Technologies (ICTs); Mobile phones; Price elasticity of demand",""

This unique approach to spatial analysis can be used across library and information settings (or in other spaces with large amounts of human traffic) to map patterns in user behavior. Results of the visual analyses can be triangulated with other methods (e.g., questionnaires or interviews) to better inform library policy and space planning decisions. Findings from a study that used VTS in the business library of a large, urban university illustrate the potential application of this technique across library settings. Specific findings (e.g., patrons' preferences for certain spaces for laptop use, despite the library reserving other space for laptops) demonstrate the power of visualization techniques for analyzing results in ways that are not possible with standard statistical analysis approaches. In addition, the visual maps that result from the analysis process are useful for the presentation of visual data in conference presentations and/or to library stakeholders.

This phenomenon results in drastic shift in customer attitude and behavior on how to connect and interact with others. MIM service has been replacing telecommunications operators (telcos) short message service, and because third-party MIM applications are those gaining meaningful traction, this trend is threatening the telecommunications industry as it leads to losses in telcos̈ revenues. To cope with this onslaught of third-party MIM applications, telcos launched Joyn, their own MIM application. However, despite their similar technical characteristics, Joyn still lacks user traction. It is critical, therefore, to understand the antecedents to continuance use intention of MIM applications in both contexts. Based on the expanded expectation-confirmation model (ECM), the present research develops a benefit-confirmation model that examines the antecedents to continuance intention to use MIM applications, while provides a comparative analysis of two popular MIM applications in Korea - KakaoTalk (third-party) and Joyn (telcos). A total of 467 data point were collected online. The structural equation modeling results of the total sample provide support for ECM-related hypotheses as well as for significant effects of net benefits and network benefits on continuance intention to use MIM applications, while the comparative analysis suggests that KakaoTalks prominent features are hedonic in nature, whereas, Joyńs main attribute is its interoperability.

As a first investigation, we seek unknown breakpoints in countries' investment series. Market opening and unbundling obligations are found to be temporally associated with investment breaks only in some countries, and both upward and downward shifts are detected. In order to understand causes behind cross-country heterogeneity, a micro-econometric model of incumbent's investments is estimated. Neither unbundling obligations nor competition intensity, alone, have a significant effect, but they spur incumbent's investments in combination. Overall, our results support the view that competition does not depress investments at firm and country levels. Conditionally on their ability to foster competition, unbundling obligations play a positive role. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Breakpoint; Competition; Investment; Telecommunications; Unbundling",""

However, prior measures leave room for extensions. Therefore, this paper introduces a new second-order overall index assessing the availability, adoption and usage intensity of telecommunication networks and services at the country level. The proposed Telecommunications Development Index (TDI) integrates 11 indicators, which are grouped into three first-level subindices labeled Supply, Adoption and Usage. Indicator and subindex weights used in combining them into higher-order measures are computed drawing on Partial Least Squares (PLS) structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques. The modeling rests on the assumption that TDI weights should be outcome-specific and thus constructed in a way that maximizes the indicators and subindices capability, respectively to predict socially desirable national performance criteria such as per capita gross domestic product (GDP) change or a countrys Human Development Index (HDI) value. Based on data from 111 countries, this approach was used to calculate weights of the indicators and subindices merged into a total TDI predicting either GDP per capita change or a countrys HDI. In both TDI variants the Adoption subindex variable fixed broadband subscriptions per household and the Supply subindex variable international bandwidth capacity available per Internet user achieved the highest relative weights of all indicators in the prediction of the two studied social outcome criteria. The PLS SEM results were used to calculate scores of the two TDI variations for each of the sample countries.

Three sources of discourse, which were coded for common themes, were analyzed.

Second, they constructed public institutions as symbols of the community that must represent their values and aid parents in their difficult role as boundary setters. Finally, challengers demonstrated a reverence for the books as a material object and employed common sense interpretive strategies.

The three cases examined illustrate the challenges that the Chinese government faces in implementing the policies. Most of all, while the government has actively promoted indigenous innovation as a latecomer strategy for global standardization, there are possibilities of clash with the international norms for free competition and economic liberalization which China is supposed to comply with. There are also oppositions from those domestic firms that mainly export products compliant with the international standards set by advanced countries, and from local authorities that support those firms.

High scores in EU benchmarking have contributed to increasing the institutionally-perceived quality but not necessarily the real quality and utility of e-government services. The article concludes by outlining implications for policy and practical recommendations for filling the gaps identified in measurement and evaluation of e-government.

The paper constructs an exploratory conceptual model of technology utilization and expenditures in Japan, induced from prior literature. Ten dependent ICT utilization and expenditure factors are posited to be related to 12 independent demographic, economic, infrastructure, education, innovation and openness factors. The relationship of the independent to dependent factors is moderated by analysis of spatial patterns of technology utilization to examine proximities and reduce spatial bias. Based on the model, a multivariate analysis identifies correlates of the nations digital divide, including patents registered by Japanese citizens, newspaper circulation, students and pupils per capita, household expenditures on education, rural/urban status, and Japans aged population structure which has wide generational gaps. Spatial clusters and outliers of ICTs in prefectures are analyzed, with attention to their policy impacts. Findings suggest modifications to the conceptual model.

The state-of-the-art method for collecting data for activity based traffic models is a combination of travel diaries and GPS tracking data, an approach which is not well suited for capturing data on experiences surrounding trips. Currently increasing research is being done on how to incorporate such data in traffic models, and there is therefore a need for a method, which is suited to collect such data. The new method presented in this article builds on ideas from experience sampling methods (ESM) and it is well suited specifically for collecting such experience data. Given the use of SMS technology, this method makes it possible to reach a wide range of respondents. The usefulness of the new method is proven on a theoretical level and illustrated in practice through a case study. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It identifies two emerging models: (1) interconnection and compensation arrangements that increase the total payments to Internet Service Providers (""ISPs"") from end users, upstream ISPs and content providers; and (2) strategies by content creators and distributors to achieve congestion-free delivery at the lowest cost. While supportive of commercially negotiated agreements, the paper suggests that the two emerging models will trigger more disputes as interconnecting parties increasingly lack motivation to cooperate in finding ways to balance traffic flows and instead seek ever increasing compensation. The paper recommends that National Regulatory Authorities require ISPs to engage in transparent network management practices, backed up with reporting requirements that can help identify the causes of congestion and degraded service. The paper also suggests ways for regulators to resolve disputes between ISPs and content providers that could harm consumers, particularly when retail ISPs, providing the first and last kilometer of service, seek to leverage access to end users by demanding surcharges from upstream carriers and content providers. By creating such a bottleneck, retail ISPs may reduce the value of Internet access subscriptions, or increase costs even when congestion remedies do not require more broadband network capacity. Reporting requirements can provide empirical data for necessary forensic investigations that can determine whether a massive increase in traffic volume has caused congestion, or a carrier has artificially created it by strategic allocation of existing bandwidth and switching capacity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

There are many detection approaches, some performed primarily by network operators and some by application-layer agents. This paper describes capabilities, limitations, privacy issues, and policy implications of detection technologies and their countermeasures, in part through quantitative analysis of empirical data. Different approaches are better for different purposes. Network operators are well-positioned to estimate how widespread copyright violations are, but application-layer detection from outside entities has important advantages when the purpose is punishment. Detection is also imperfect, so policies should require more transparency regarding how it is done than we see today. It is shown that, although network operators may not detect every transfer, and they typically miss more video than audio, they can identify most individuals who share copyrighted files via P2P after several weeks of monitoring provided that traffic is unencrypted, which is useful for some purposes. However, it is also shown that encryption is already in use, and it effectively prevents network operators from detecting transfers of copyrighted content. Thus, if network operators are held responsible for monitoring illegal file sharing, there is a tension between using detection to identify violators of copyright law for punishment, which may motivate even greater use of encryption, and using detection for other purposes such as creating fair compensation schemes for copyright-holders, warning users that they may be violating copyright law, or allocating network resources. Alternatively, there are forms of detection that are not evaded through encryption, and application-layer agents rather than network operators are primarily responsible for these. These copyright policy issues are intertwined with network neutrality policy in subtle ways. Network neutrality rules do not protect illegal transfers of copyrighted content, but if network operators are responsible for enforcement (as in ""graduated response"") then regulators must determine when it is reasonable to terminate or degrade service based on allegations of copyright violation given the limitations of detection technology to prove those allegations. Allegations of copyright violation should be considered invalid unless they are accompanied with information about how detection was performed and an opportunity for rebuttal. Such transparency has been routinely lacking in both laws and industry agreements. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Copyright; Deep packet inspection; Graduated response; Network neutrality; Open Internet; Peer to peer file sharing (P2P)",""

The optimal two-part tariffs that the regulator should set under the following three regulatory rules are derived: no flexibility (the monopolist only offers the regulated plan), partial flexibility (the monopolist can offer alternative plans, but these - and the regulated one - must be available to all customers), and full flexibility (the regulated plan must be available to all customers, but the alternative ones could be offered to specific clients). The solutions under the three schemes are characterized, and they provide an unambiguous ranking of regulatory rules: total flexibility is weakly better than partial flexibility, and partial flexibility is strictly better than no flexibility. As the regulatory scheme becomes more flexible, the optimally regulated two-part tariff increases its fixed component and decreases the variable one. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Monopoly regulation; Network utilities; Non-linear tariffs; Universal service obligation",""

There has been a long-running debate on the use of indicators based on citation counts to measure research quality. The key argument is that using indicators based on raw citation counts to evaluate research quality lacks measurement validity. Traditional reference formats do not present any quality related evaluations of the citing authors toward their references. It can be argued that the strength of peer evaluation to a research output, which is taken to represent its quality, is the elementary unit in the evaluation and comparison of research performance. A good candidate for evaluating a piece of research is a researcher who cites the research and knows it well. By accumulating different citing authors' evaluations of their references based on a uniform evaluation scheme and synthesizing the evaluations into a single indicator, the qualities of research works, scientists, journals, research groups, and institutions in different disciplines can be assessed and compared. A method consisting of three components is proposed: a reference evaluation scheme, a new reference format, and a new indicator, called the average evaluation intensity. This method combines the advantages of citation count analysis, citation motivation analysis, and peer review, and may help to advance the debate. The potential advantages of and main concerns about the proposed method are discussed. The proposed method may serve as a preliminary theoretical framework that can inspire and advance a quality-oriented approach to the evaluation of research performance.

Anecdotal and editorial based observations express concerns regarding this situation but there is a lack of research exploring it. The research which does exist has been conducted at a generic level with little relevance to specific disciplines of librarianship therefore weakening its impact and applicability at discipline level. To date, there have been no studies that examine issues of research engagement exclusively within the context of UK health librarianship. This study reports on the findings of a focus group conducted as part of a larger study which attempted to redress this current gap in the evidence base. The focus group aimed specifically to gain consensus on the top five key barriers and top five key priorities for research engagement in the UK health librarianship. The main findings suggest that barriers to research engagement are mainly contextualised within research addressing key matters for the profession of health librarianship, whilst priorities are mainly contextualised within the role health librarians have in supporting the research of the health professionals to whom they provide library services. Outcomes of the focus group provide early empirical evidence to confirm that whilst there is considerable goodwill towards research and the development of the evidence base in health librarianship, there are existing challenges between working for the interests of both the library service user and development of the evidence base in healthcare, and the evidence based progression of the health librarianship profession. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","",""

The purpose of this paper is to suggest a new regional clustering approach of China from the perspective of mobile telecommunications based on the diffusion characteristics of estimated innovation and imitation coefficients in the mobile telecommunications market. While China has traditionally identified three groups of regions, a cluster analysis based on those diffusion characteristics shows that the 31 provinces in China can be classified into six groups. This empirical result implies that the traditional regional classification seems too simple and that the market should be segmented further in order to develop policies more relevant to Chinese mobile telecommunications. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

For its classic case, copyright can only increase welfare in a dynamic setting, when the static welfare losses are offset by dynamic welfare gains: monopolistic rents give producers an incentive to produce more, offering consumers more innovation in return. In the digital age, many economists have remained skeptical about the welfare benefits of strong copyright policies, notwithstanding the lack of indicators of the actual effects of such policies, especially in terms of the production of new cultural goods. While accepting this conclusion, the paper argues that, in order to construct a more realistic landscape of indicators to inform copyright policy makers, the economic case of copyright needs to be broadened to include not only the direct producers of the work in its material form, but also the producers of the meaning and value of the work (the overall perception of its ""quality""). Once both symbolic and material production are theoretically and empirically incorporated in the economic case of copyright policy, a new set of hypothesis and indicators can be constructed and tested in relation to changes in the telecommunication system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Lost subscribers were much less inclined to name any reason at all for their defection notice than the two remaining groups. The share of subjects stating that a mismatch between their personal communication needs and their postpaid arrangement was the main driver to quit, was significantly higher in the partially restored group than in the rest of the sample.

This paper describes and quantifies the economic and technical challenges associated with deepening wireless networks to meet this growing demand. Methods of capacity expansion divide into three general categories: the deployment of more radio spectrum; more intensive geographic reuse of spectrum; and increasing the throughput capacity of each MHz of spectrum within a given geographic area. The paper describes these several basic methods to deepen mobile wireless capacity. It goes on to measure the contribution of each of these methods to historical capacity growth within U.S. networks. The paper then describes the capabilities of 4G LTE wireless technology, and further innovations off of it, to further improve network capacity. These capacity expansion capabilities of LTE-Advanced along with traditional spectrum reuse are quantified and compared to forecasts of future demand to evaluate the ability of U.S. networks to match future demand. Without significantly increasing current spectrum allocations by 560 MHz over the 2014-2022 period, the presented model suggests that U.S. wireless capacity expansion will be inadequate to accommodate expected demand growth.

In broadband networks, the use of open access policy usually refers to the infrastructure parts, which are considered a bottleneck. Many regulators have generally focused open access policy on fixed broadband networks, especially digital subscriber line (DSL) technology, in the last decade. Local loop unbundling (LLU) regulation is one of the main strategies for the regulator to open access to an incumbent's bottleneck network in order to soften its monopoly power and encourage competition in the DSL broadband market. The OECD countries have different strategies regarding unbundling local loop and infrastructure competition, as the characteristics and infrastructure networks of countries vary. There are currently more choices of next generation network (NGN) technologies to develop. While local loop unbundling may not be applied fully to NGN development (the cost is not sunk, more technologies are available to implement, incentive of investment by operator), it can indicate benefits and drawbacks of open access policy in the past decade that can be adapted to NGN. The empirical results of this study show that during 2002-2008, LLU regulation was one of the strategies used to increase broadband adoption in countries that had difficulty encouraging infrastructure competition. Unbundling regulation can therefore be implemented carefully and differently in each country that has inefficiency that is harmful to consumers in its market from a monopoly incumbent. Infrastructure competition, on the other hand, is introduced as another strategy to increase broadband adoption. The empirical results of this study indicate that infrastructure competition can be used as a strategy when there are already enough infrastructures in the area or country. These results support the idea of using open access and infrastructure competition policy depending on the existing competition of broadband infrastructure in each country. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Availability data from the National Broadband Map aggregated to county level is used in conjunction with county-level adoption data from Federal Communication Commission. Economic variables of interest include median household income, number of firms with paid employees, total employed, percentage in poverty, and the percentage of employees classified as either creative class or non-farm proprietors. A propensity score matching technique (between a ""treated"" group associated with various broadband thresholds and a control group) is used to make preliminary causal statements regarding broadband and economic health. Growth rates between 2001 and 2010 for different economic measures are tested for statistical differences between the treated and non-treated groups, restricting the analysis to non-metropolitan counties. Results suggest that high levels of broadband adoption in rural areas positively (and potentially causally) impacted income growth between 2001 and 2010, and negatively influenced unemployment growth. Similarly, low levels of broadband adoption in rural areas lead to declines in the number of firms and total employment numbers in the county.

Standardization is regarded primarily as a technical issue, and hence receives only limited high-level policy support. However, technical standards contribute at least as much as patents to economic growth. As a key mechanism for the diffusion of technological knowledge and due to the dominant leadership by advanced countries in patenting, technical standards have emerged in latecomer countries as an alternative to patenting. However, latecomer countries and their firms have a set of capabilities and constraints that are fundamentally different from that of advanced countries and firms. This paper argues that latecomer countries should adopt assessment criteria that are more fitted with latecomer contexts which emphasize learning effects and building dynamic capabilities. The paper discusses current issues that are essential in understanding the rise of Asian countries in standardization. We also examine the critical role that patents play for standardization and argue that ""strategic patenting"" to generate rents from de facto industry standards can stifle latecomer economic development. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It draws on in-depth case studies of South Africa, Namibia and Kenya where regulators have reduced termination rates towards the cost of an efficient operator. To varying degrees these have all led to lower retail prices and significant market expansion. While retail prices in both Namibia and Kenya dropped following substantial termination rate reductions, the South African case demonstrates that termination rate reductions are not always passed on to consumers as is hoped by such regulatory interventions. In South Africa, it was only after the second reduction in March 2012 that smaller operators were able to reduce their off-net prices to a level that could tempt the subscribers to dominant operators to switch. All the case studies confirm nevertheless that retail prices do not go up in response to termination rates going down as contended by dominant mobile operators around the world. This is in contrast to a body of literature stating that termination rates and mobile retail prices constitute a two-sided market and that termination rate reductions will lead to a so-called ""waterbed effect"". © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Careful study reveals that the label ""virtual"", while useful in a descriptive way, does not identify anything economically unique. Virtual economies tend to behave like any other economy and also increasingly interact in predictable ways with the so-called real economy. Yet, these interactions raise important and unresolved questions for law and policy. While most of the legal questions have been addressed by scholars, at this point, most remain unresolved by the courts. In addition, there is little systematic analysis of policy issues for virtual worlds. This paper identifies a number of reasons why the boundaries between the real and virtual worlds are eroding. In doing so, it addresses a few of the major policy issues faced by virtual world operators as the boundaries of their creations push against the real world. It also demonstrates how the developers of virtual worlds already behave as policy makers, and how their own actions continue to blur the boundary between themselves and national governments. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A potentially disruptive technology would be to have unlicensed transmission in the lower UHF bands at power levels up to, e.g. 2 W EIRP. This would give citizens a share of the best spectrum for free use. Tools against congestion could be based on mandatory stochastic channel back-off or, if multiple users are present, on adaptive power and bandwidth control. Compared to the FCC TV white space regulation, no back link would be needed as the spectrum would be used exclusively by wireless devices. In an environment of shrinking interest in terrestrial TV broadcasting, such a regulation is expected to create a new market for high-range consumer devices, competing with licensed communication, while also being suitable for offloading traffic from licensed operations. Furthermore, the approach will allow for efficient digitization of equipment for Programme Making and Special Events (PMSE), but could also be made compatible with novel disaster relief services. To enable accurate interference prediction, it is proposed that, instead of only providing transmitter regulation, receivers should also be regulated, such as be required to adhere to a certain minimum selectivity.

The research is conducted through a techno-economic assessment in an infrastructure competition scenario. A discounted cash flow method is used to determine the total cost of the deployment for the operator and the minimum average revenue per user (ARPU) which would be required to recover the investment in both approaches: passive network sharing and non-sharing. On the other hand, the three demand scenarios that were considered, depending on the envisaged Spanish broadband penetration by 2020, attempt to calculate what take-up and ARPU are likely in the targeted rural areas. As mobile operators' coverage obligation stipulates covering 90% of the municipalities with less than 5000 inhabitants, extreme rural areas, which correspond to the final 0.7% of the population, are excluded from this assessment. The results indicate that, given the socio-economic characteristics of the assessed area, demand is very sensitive to price and that the existence of other broadband products forces the operator to lower the ARPU. As a result, only very high take-up ratios would make the deployment feasible. The research shows that passive network sharing does not constitute a solution; nevertheless, a single network deployment could solve the unfeasibility problem in rural areas. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Its aggressive marketing and data collection practices, however, have placed Facebook at the center of public policy debates over consumer privacy in the Big Data era. This paper explores those controversial practices, focusing especially on their effects on youth. More than 80% of teens use social media, which have become an essential arena for personal and social development, and which may well be altering some of young peoples' behavior patterns. But except for a handful of studies (mostly published in marketing journals) the growing body of academic literature on social media and youth has ignored the role of marketplace forces. Yet economic imperatives and powerful e-commerce business models are fueling the growth of these new platforms, shaping their structures and operations, and both responding to and influencing user behaviors. The driving force behind the growth of social media-and, indeed, all digital media-is a complex set of data collection, tracking, and targeting systems that monitor and monetize individual users' behaviors as well as their interactions with friends and acquaintances. Facebook's marketing, data collection, tracking, and targeting operations are specially attuned to key aspects of adolescent development, both tapping into young peoples' needs and taking advantage of their unique vulnerabilities. Because of adolescents' emotional volatility and their tendency to act impulsively, they are more vulnerable than adults to such techniques as real-time bidding, location targeting (especially when the user is near a point of purchase), and ""dynamic creative"" ads tailored to their individual profile and behavioral patterns. Given the unique role that digital media play in the lives of young people, new strategies will be required to ensure that their privacy is enshrined as a fundamental right. One way to accomplish this is to develop a set of ""Fair Information and Marketing Principles for Children and Teens,"" drawn from the long-established and well-recognized Fair Information Privacy Practices. These principles should take into account the unique needs and vulnerabilities of youth, and be designed to balance the ability of young people to participate fully in the contemporary media culture-as producers, consumers, and citizens-with the governmental and industry obligation to ensure they are not subjected to unfair, manipulative, and deceptive data collection and marketing practices. In order to achieve these goals, advocacy organizations, educators, parents, scholars, and youth need to work together as part of a broad, social movement, making privacy for children and youth part of the larger policy agenda on behalf of all consumers and citizens. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The results are strikingly divergent. Japanese involvement in Internet standardization began early and Japan was, for many years, second only to the U.S. in terms of IETF participation. Though Japanese participation has declined since the early 2000s, Japan remains a major contributor to IETF standardization. Korean involvement in IETF has always been significant, but below the levels of Japan and major European countries. Korean participation in IETF has also declined over the past decade, and has been dominated by one firm, Samsung. Though meaningful Chinese involvement in IETF did not begin until the mid-2000s, it has rapidly expanded in recent years. Today, China is a major player in numerous areas of Internet standardization in terms of three metrics (participation, patenting and leadership), and is rapidly gaining in terms of document authorship as well. Most of China's recent IETF involvement can be attributed to Huawei, though other Chinese firms have recently begun to increase their participation in the organization. Thus, contrary to some views that China's engagement with standardization is primarily one of indigenous innovation and ""catching up"", China's experience with IETF demonstrates deliberate and effective engagement with a major Western standards-development organization on its own terms. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The USA is clearly the top global player in ICT in many respects. In both ICT Manufacturing and ICT Services it has the largest Value Added, BERD, BERD intensity and labour productivity. We further observe that China has, by far, the largest number of employees in both ICT Manufacturing and Services, while its level of ICT BERD remains low.

Replacing the dominant positions that questionnaire survey and historical method previously held, content analysis, experiment, and theoretical approach have become the top choices of research methods in the field. This study also examines two recurring themes regarding research methods in the LIS field, namely, use of multiple methods in one study and adoption of the qualitative approach, but finds no conclusive evidence of increased implementation of either practice. More efforts in the form of education, training and advocacy are therefore needed to help LIS scholars gain a better understanding of research methods and make more informed decisions on research method selection and implementation in their scholarly endeavors. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","",""

Situation, task, and practice are some of the ways of conceptualizing the context of information activities. Differences between these concepts are rarely discussed, and their theoretical underpinnings are not necessarily well understood. This analysis describes the historical background of the person-in-situation approach, task theory, and practice theory. The underlying assumptions are brought into view and analyzed in detail. Practice theory, task theory, and person-in-situation theories guide researchers to carve out and define their research foci in divergent and incompatible ways. It is argued that it would also be possible to understand and define these concepts within an integrated theoretical framework. Practice theory is a theoretical framework within which both situations and tasks can be understood as distinct parts of a situated activity setting.

This study focuses on how this differs according to the geographical location of the researcher, specifically in terms of the country's level of development. Data were collected by a questionnaire survey of 3650 authors who had published articles in international journals. The human development index (HDI) was used to compare authors' scholarly behavior. The findings show that researchers from less developed countries such as India and China (medium HDI) compared to those in developed countries, such as the USA and UK (very high HDI) are more reliant on external factors and those criteria that are related to authority, brand and reputation, such as authors' names, affiliation, country and journal name. Even when deciding where to publish, the publisher of the journal is more important for developing countries than it is for researchers from the US and UK. Scholars from high HDI countries also differ in these aspects: a) they are less discriminatory than authors from developing countries in their citation practices; b) for them the fact that a source is peer reviewed is the most important factor when deciding where to publish; c) they are more negative towards the use of repositories and social media for publishing and more skeptical about their potential for increasing usage or reaching a wider audience. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","",""

The methodology is a combination of market and cash flow valuation and consists of two main steps. First, prices for spectrum corresponding to that of the licences to be extended are derived from the auction outcome. Second, the relative value addition of the extension period for the new licensee, compared to the value of the licences auctioned, is derived by using a model for the development of EBITDA for an operator over time. A combination of these two is used to calculate fees that match the opportunity costs of extension. Thus, optimum alignment is achieved with the policy objective of using licence fees only to promote efficient use of spectrum, while avoiding state aid at the same time. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose a composite measure of digital inclusion/exclusion which combines three sub-indexes, each integrating a number of variables into a single indicator. This framework covers access (to ICT devices and technological connectivity), basic skills (individual know-how for elementary uses), and complex capabilities (higher-level ability for creative engagement and ICT-mediated interaction). On the basis of a composite measure ranging from 0 to 100 we provide quantitative assessments of informational inequality levels amongst individuals and by employing an ordered probit model we are able to identify its key determinants. We explore a large and rather under-exploited nationally representative dataset - the official large-scale survey of information and knowledge society, a Eurostat standardised data collection instrument. In Portugal this is implemented by the Portuguese National Statistics Office, which for 2011 reached a sample of 7175 respondents. Results show a high level of inequality, especially in terms of ability for basic as well as complex ICT utilisation. This particular inequality configuration seems to be mostly explained by age, education, employment situation, household type, and income distribution. Methodological approaches such as ours, which may be extended to other national cases, can be considered as an increasingly appropriate way to address the need for a new generation of equality-friendly ICT policies that go beyond the early notions of ""digital divide"" focusing on the availability of ICT tools (to have or to not have resources) and start addressing individual and interactive uses (emerging behavioural developments). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite an increasing growth of broadband networks combined with a rising number of studies calculating in great detail the direct costs and benefits of these deployments, less attention has been paid to the indirect effects resulting from those emerging applications. As these effects have proven to contribute to economic growth, this paper argues that that they should be taken into account when evaluating a cost-benefit analysis and proposes a model for conceptualization, measurement and quantification. It studies these indirect benefits in the area of e-government (related in particular to savings on travel and waiting time by introducing an e-counter) and e-business (related to reducing traffic jams by allowing employees to work at home). In a bottom up manner, the paper quantifies the indirect benefits in these two sectors by studying two cities: Ghent (Belgium) and Eindhoven (the Netherlands). By quantifying these benefits per actor, the paper shows that the indirect benefits would provide large business and local authorities additional incentives to stimulate investment in broadband networks. The model and results of the paper could be used by decision-makers to improve the business case for new investments in fibre networks and allows evaluating existing and future investment cases. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This study uses the stochastic distance function approach to capture the role of institutions in explaining efficiency differences across 70 countries. The empirical analysis reveals that policy stability in the form of substantive checks and balances on executive power is the most important aspect for successful reform.

As a first step, we estimate the returns from broadband infrastructure for the period 2005-2011, differentiating the impact of broadband by levels of adoption and speed while accounting for reverse causality and extensive heterogeneity. In the second step, the cost of broadband roll-out is assessed under different assumptions of technical performance and contrasted with the forecasted benefits that derive from increased broadband coverage. We find that in the base case scenario the overall future benefits outweigh the investment costs for the European Union as a whole for the highest performance technologies. This holds also for the majority of member states individually. We further extrapolate the returns by country under different scenarios of implementation. In most cases the benefits are substantially well above the costs. Private sector is reluctant to invest, as investors in broadband infrastructure only can partially appropriate benefits.

Since this approach offers only limited assessments in absolute terms, it is difficult for decision-makers to track and improve overall performance. Therefore, the use of non-parametric frontier methods, namely free disposal hull (FDH) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) is presented as an alternative technique for benchmarking the performance of organizations in relative terms.

One of the main motivations behind the Commission's introduction of the Framework was the promotion of competition in electronic communications sector in regard to the welfare of EU citizens and the creation of a common market for electronic communications. Notwithstanding the fact that the telecommunications market has opened and new operators with new service offerings have emerged, a lot of criticism has been voiced regarding the Framework's effectiveness on several fronts (e.g. infrastructure based competition, wholesale/retail costs, uniform market structure across Europe). The paper takes another look at the implementation of the current Regulatory Framework and the ex ante remedies imposed across Member States. The implementation of the Framework is related to the evolution and competition of the fixed narrowband, fixed broadband and mobile group of markets, using indicators for an empirical discussion of the market analysis process in the EU. It uses data derived mainly from the European Commission itself and calculates indices that paint a clearer picture with respect to the evolution and competition in the above group of markets. Based on this process, the paper provides very strong indications that the current Regulatory Framework and in particular the market analysis process promotes competition both at wholesale and retail level. Finally, the paper suggests that the decision to remove market 15 from the list of markets susceptible for ex ante regulation should be revisited. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The model considers two potentially coexisting and partially competing technologies (the ""old generation network"" - OGN - and the ""new"" generation network - NGN). This framework allows us to show that the ""regulation defining access charge in order to maximize infrastructure deployment"" is strictly equivalent to the case in which ""no regulation applies"". We also derive from the model that these two types of regulation induce higher social welfare, but lower numbers of NGN consumers, compared to the ""ex post access prices"" regulation. Finally, we show that the level of infrastructure deployment (as well as social welfare and number of NGN consumers) will be highest if both investment and access charge decisions are taken by the welfare maximizing regulator.

So said then-Chairman of the FCC Genachowski in a recent proceeding, and this sentiment is widely heard. However, we are aware of very few engineering studies that have a bearing on this matter, and their conclusions are equivocal. Beyond this, evidence for ""congestion problems"" in the 2.4 GHz ISM band is anecdotal at best. While some users no doubt sometimes have service difficulties they ascribe to congestion, that is not sufficient to prove that there is a policy problem. In order to provide a basis for policy decisions, we offer an analysis of congestion metrics and results in the engineering literature. We conclude that there is little consensus on how to measure congestion, and that network metrics are difficult to correlate with user experience. We therefore propose a list of user experience-oriented service impairment criteria that, if met, would demonstrate that congestion exists to a degree that justifies regulatory intervention: For more than one of the key scenarios that are supported by an operator or technology there is a significant increase in the percentage of users who cannot complete a valuable task on a persistent, ubiquitous basis in spite of the use of state-of-the-art engineering/deployment best practices, and users' willingness to pay the market rate for the best available service level. Based on our assessment of public reports and experimental data, we conclude that there is currently no evidence for pervasive Wi-Fi congestion. We do not claim that the absence of evidence of congestion amounts to evidence for the absence of congestion. However, we do question the argument that congestion occurring somewhere, sometimes is a justification for regulatory intervention. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper particularly focuses on two issues. Firstly, it addresses the relationship between the mobile operator choice and the subscriber bases and average prices of the operators (size effects and price mediated effects, respectively). Then, it identifies the effect of the other households' choices on the operator choice of the respondents (social network effects). The results are in line with the theory that the prices and the subscriber base-and to a greater extent, the household effects - are important factors taken into account during the subscription decisions. The results also indicate that, compared with the period in which prices were loosely regulated, the estimated effects of prices and installed bases for the whole observed period are almost halved, while the effect of household network roughly keeps its level. These results make the focusing on narrower sub-networks i.e. calling clubs or social networks, an appealing strategy for the operators with relatively smaller networks. The paper suggests that the regulatory authorities should consider the possible sources of network effects in their market power analysis and future regulations. Meanwhile, the policy makers should be careful regarding the network quality regulations since the competition in Turkish mobile market seems to take the form of an intensified quality competition. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Logistic regression; Mobile telecommunications; Network effects; Social network effects",""

As opposed to UHF broadcast spectrum, which contains unassigned or idle segments known as white spaces, the 400 MHz band is characterised by intensive licence usage. However, productive spectrum usage does not guarantee allocative efficiency, which would require knowledge of the highest value service for each licence. 400 MHz frequencies are not priced on opportunity cost. It is therefore difficult to ascertain the economically efficient mix of services to deploy in the 400 MHz band. Drawing parallels with the high-economic value revealed and generated through the operations of unlicensed white space devices in UHF broadcast spectrum, we identify untapped 400 MHz spectrum capacity, which we refer to as narrowband spaces. Encouraging dynamic spectrum usage of narrowband spaces could, similarly to TV white space usage help realise the efficient allocation of the 400 MHz band. However, the narrowband nature of the 400 MHz licences and high licensing turnover imply a significantly different concept of dynamic spectrum access than that considered for TV Bands. The paper discusses regulatory implications and the type of services suited to exploit narrowband spaces. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Dynamic spectrum access; Gray space; Narrowband licences; Spectrum management; White space",""

Finally, by means of a second stage regression, we investigate the effect on technical efficiency of set of variables representing the competitive environment, the ownership structure and the degree of vertical separation. Our results show that the assumptions embedded in the DDF model influence relevantly the technical efficiency estimates, where important potential bias can arise if the duality of outputs is ignored, with a subsequent relevant impact also on the second stage results. These findings highlight the relevance of choosing benchmarking models consistent with the features of the analysed technology and show that the DDF approach is a flexible tool able to accommodate even complex output structures. ©2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The Structure-Conduct-Performance paradigm provides the theoretical grounding. Structural equations modelling was applied to determine the statistically significant factors and components in the path model. The data set was derived from public sources combined with a questionnaire completed by the national regulatory authorities. The data collection took place in the period May 2012-December 2012. In this contribution we focus on fixed broadband. The Broadband Performance Index resulting from the analysis consists of: the cumulative broadband uptake (across all technology platforms); the average monthly revenues per user; and the percentage of broadband households with a data rate above 10 Mbit/s on the down link. The most important factor representing firm conduct and the main driver of broadband performance is the level of investment, which is in turn driven by GDP/capita. The factor best representing market structure is a modified Herfindal Hirschman Index (HHI∗) capturing the platform-based competition (PSTN, CATV, FttH, and the market shares of access-based competitors). The HHI∗ is in turn driven by the wholesale price for unbundling and by the degree of urbanization. The resulting performance index values range from 73 to 121, with the EU average set at 100. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The proportion of Scopus LIS articles mentioning some aspect of computing in their title, abstract, or keywords increased steadily from 1986 to 2000, then stabilised at about two thirds, indicating a continuing dominance of computers in most LIS research. Within this general trend, many computer-related terms have peaked and then declined in popularity. For example, the proportion of Scopus LIS article titles, abstracts, or keywords that included the terms ""computer"" or ""computing"" decreased fairly steadily from about 20% in 1975 to 5% in 2013, and the proportion explicitly mentioning the web peaked at 18% in 2002.

Following this trajectory, this paper addresses governance by social media rather than governance of social media. Informed by conceptual frameworks from Internet governance and Science and Technology Studies, it examines the extent to which these platforms either promote or constrain rights in three thematic areas: (1) anonymous speech and individual privacy; (2) the ability to express ideas or, stated as a negative liberty, freedom from censorship; and (3) technical affordances of interoperability and permissionless innovation. Because of their unique role as the intermediaries providing citizens with access to the digital public sphere, social media platforms are central points of control on the Internet. Viewing these private platforms through an Internet governance lens, rather than a content lens, suggests that social media technical architectures and policies actually pose several challenges to communication rights as well as to the open Internet. There is an opportunity for Internet governance studies, which have primarily focused on governmental policies and new global institutions, to give greater consideration to the direct policymaking role of private intermediaries and the accompanying phenomenon of the privatization of human rights. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Experienced academic users were also found to create more tags per bookmark comparing to the other two groups. Most novice academic users, however, only created one tag per bookmark, which just met Connotea's minimum requirement. Surprisingly different from the collaborative design nature of the social bookmarking systems, the study finds that our participants, particularly experienced academic users, prefer to create and use their own bookmarks rather than sharing bookmarks created by others. In fact, experienced users have significantly higher frequency (once every two weeks) of creating bookmarks than the other two groups (once a month or less). In addition, website design features and functions, such as automatic collection of bibliographic information, are regarded by all participants as helpful for information discovery.

Even though the natural growth in the demand continues, the growth in traffic volumes can be limited by reducing unnecessary content copying and redundant transportation of the same content. Information-centric networking (ICN), featuring globally unique naming of content and optimized in-network caching, has been suggested as a potential future solution to significantly reduce unnecessary traffic, but its economic feasibility has not been widely studied. This paper evaluates the economic feasibility of ICN by using the two-sided markets theory to analyze four Internet content delivery models: the client-server model, content delivery network (CDN) model, peer-to-peer model and ICN model. Value networks and two-sided markets of these content delivery models are identified in the process. The results suggest that content providers can be willing to pay for the lower delay of content delivery in ICN, if ICN can solve its coordination problems related to cost-allocation, contracting, quality of service guarantees, and content usage statistics. These incentive challenges are essentially the same as in-network web caching originally faced and could not overcome. Internet access providers may also consider investing in the deployment of ICN due to reduced interconnection costs. However, the ICN model may require a revenue-creating business model to make it more attractive to Internet access providers than the CDN model that provides similar cost savings. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Despite of its increasing availability, its level of adoption has not been satisfying. On the other hand, over the last years, coinciding with the web 2.0 trend, the e-government services co-produced by citizens start to appear, often without the support, acknowledgement and even awareness of the government. This trend stems from a well-established tradition of offline co- production of public services, i.e. services provided by the voluntary sector, but brought to an unprecedented scale thanks to the advent of web 2.0. Still, the concept remains not well-defined and its impact is not yet well studied. The paper explores on a limited sets of cases what does it mean to collaboratively deliver online public services; what are the success factors based on the cases under study and what are the incentives for service providers (other than public administration), citizens as users and public administration. The authors propose an ostensive definition of the collaborative delivery of public services: collaborative public services are created and run by government, civil society or by private sector building on the re-use of government data or citizens data. Those services are focused on public goods delivery (e.g. health, education, public transport) and are meant to change the traditional government services by engaging in an open dialogue with public administration about the best way to deliver those services. The analysis of six case studies of innovative collaborative online public services suggests that the online collaborative public service delivery increases its quality with the users growth contrary to the traditional offline service delivery. The study results indicate that the current developers interest lies in delivering complementary services to the government run services rather than substitutive services.

Finally, the Chow test and multiple regression models were also utilized to investigate the impact of telecommunications policy on productivity change of CHT. Results of empirical examination indicate that on average TFP scores obtained by the bootstrapping technique are smaller than those obtained by the MPI technique. In addition, there is no difference in productivity change of CHT between pre- and post-privatization according to the MPI and bootstrapping MPI. The results show that the effect of privatization on productivity change is insignificant. Instead, the operational efficiency of CHT is affected by the government involvement in decision-making under its private/public joint ownership, which causes CHT to be a firm with little managerial profit orientation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Bootstrap; Malmquist; Productivity; Telecommunications",""

Spectrum auctions have raised hundreds of billion dollars worldwide and have become a role model for market-based approaches in the public and private sectors. The PCS spectrum was sold via a simultaneous multi-round auction, which forces bidders to compete for licenses individually even though they typically value certain combinations. This exposes bidders to risk when they bid aggressively for a desired combination but end up winning an inferior subset. Foreseeing this possibility, bidders may act cautiously with adverse effects for revenue and efficiency. Combinatorial auctions allow for bids on combinations of licenses and thus hold the promise of improved performance. Recently, a number of countries worldwide have switched to the combinatorial clock auction to sell spectrum. This two-stage auction uses a core-selecting payment rule. The number of possible packages a bidder can submit grows exponentially with the number of licenses, which adds complexity to the auction. For larger auctions with dozens of licenses bidders cannot be expected to reveal all their valuations during such an auction. We analyze the impact of two main design choices on efficiency and revenue: simple ""compact"" bid languages versus complex ""fully expressive"" bid languages and simple ""pay-as-bid"" payment rules versus complex ""core-selecting"" payment rules. We consider these design choices both for ascending and sealed-bid formats. We find that simplicity of the bid language has a substantial positive impact on the auction's efficiency and simplicity of the payment rule has as a substantial positive impact on the auction's revenue. The currently popular combinatorial clock auction, which uses a complex bid language and payment rule, achieves the lowest efficiency and revenue among all treatment combinations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Bid languages; Laboratory experiments; Spectrum auctions",""

Estimating the value of radio spectrum, however, creates significant challenges not found in valuing some other assets. Spectrum is somewhat of a special case; market transactions provide a basis for valuation, but almost always require significant adjustments. Some adjustments are best made using discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis or econometric evidence. A review of past work on spectrum valuations suggests that focusing on a single valuation technique leaves critical information about spectrum value unused. This paper presents the theoretical underpinnings of spectrum value, and describes how these principles of spectrum value manifest in various empirical applications. Similar to most scarce resources, the value of spectrum is determined by the value generated by its deployment. This concept is typically understood as economic rent. In the case of radio spectrum, economic rent can be thought of as having two components: a sea level spectrum value driven by the general profitability of spectrum based services, and band or license specific adjustments to spectrum value due to band or license specific characteristics. Clarity about these different sources of value can inform how to apply traditional valuation techniques in a hybrid approach to spectrum valuation. The key is to capture the useful information from disparate and incomplete valuation methodologies and then combine them in a meaningful and structured manner. We then demonstrate these proposed valuation techniques empirically. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Net present value (NPV); Spectrum; Valuation",""

This trend will continue due to the seemingly ever greater use of these technologies, with broadband data traffic generated by the usage of telecommunication networks as a primary component. In fact, in response to user demand, the telecommunications industry is initiating the deployment of next generation networks (NGNs). However, energy consumption is mostly absent from the debate on these deployments, in spite of the potential impact on both expenses and sustainability. In addition, consumers are unaware of the energy impact of their choices in ultra-broadband services. This paper focuses on forecasting energy consumption in the access part of NGNs by modelling the combined effect of the deployment of two different ultra-broadband technologies (FTTH-GPON and LTE), the evolution of traffic per user, and the energy consumption in each of the networks and user devices. Conclusions are presented on the levels of energy consumption, their cost and the impact of different network design parameters. The effect of technological developments, techno-economic and policy decisions on energy consumption is highlighted.

We select WAPI and ZUC for case studies, and examine their legal aspects, particularly from the perspective of WTO's TBT (technical barriers to trade) principles. We have found that China's standardization strategy becomes international-bound and, in fact, the manner in which the Chinese government handles standardization projects has become refined, flexible, and communicative with foreign stakeholders. We see that the changes are responses to the trade concerns raised by foreign stakeholders in various TBT Committee meetings and bilateral meetings. In addition, the Chinese government appears to become market-oriented even in the field of information security where it previously maintained a rigid stance on the ground of national security.

Factors that determine the multiple services strategy include product discount, service provider and customer characteristics. Consequently, this study addresses the fundamental question: what are the key determining factors that explain the probability that a consumer buys multiple services? A generalized Poisson regression model is employed to examine whether the product discount, service provider, socio-economic variables and geographical location impact consumer decisions. Data from a national survey in 2009 commissioned by Post-och Telestyrelsen, the Swedish telecommunications regulator, are analyzed. The results clearly show that the discount, service provider and income of the consumer affect the consumers buying decision. A consumer who receives a discount or has a high income is more likely to buy multiple services or select more services from the current service provider into his basket than a consumer who does not receive discount or has lower income. Service providers, cable TV operators and telecommunications carriers can also lock-in their consumer and expand their market position from one particular service to another using bundling service.

While dichotomous coding of de jure independence has served as a proxy to measure whether an agency's regulatory governance is transparent, non-arbitrary, and free from political influence, we view measuring multiple components of regulatory governance including incorporating measures of regulatory independence into a composite index as providing a more nuanced understanding of facilitating or inhibiting factors. This paper compares composite telecommunications regulatory independence indices and regulatory governance indices available in the literature in order to construct more parsimonious indices. Using a methodology labeled ""qualitative meta-synthesis"" based on synthesizing previously published indices, we construct six different indices using combinations of 32 different variables, and different weights. Data from the OECD database are used to re-create the five original indices from the literature as well as our own six composites. Some of these indices (original and composites) were found to be negatively correlated with independent measures of regulatory governance such as the World Bank's Government Effectiveness Index and the Rule of Law Index; this may be attributable to the fact that countries, and especially those with poor overall governance standards, may need to put in place stronger telecommunications governance institutions in order to attract telecommunications investment to the country. The analysis suggests that a parsimonious index of as few as seven variables is capable of measuring the quality of telecommunications governance in a country, at the same time making the selection of variables and their weighting in the index more systematic than in previously available indices. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Index; Indicators; Reform; Regulation; Regulatory agencies; Telecommunications governance",""

Studies combining groups (e.g., Lane et al., 2012) have shown high correlations between two factors, suggesting the possibility that a two-factor model may fit as well as the three-factor model theorized by the developers. Also, previous studies have not closely examined residuals to analyze local misfit in the context of theory but instead have often correlated error terms to improve model fit. This study uses LibQUAL. + responses from undergraduates at a public, comprehensive university to test three-factor, two-factor, and one-factor models of user perceptions of library service quality. Global fit indices indicated that both two-factor and three-factor models were empirically supported, but the three-factor model had better theoretical support. Furthermore, this article adds to the literature the unique perspective of residual analysis and builds theoretical arguments in the interpretation of the final model. Areas of local misfit suggest the need for independent studies to examine residuals. If areas of misfit repeat across institutional populations, that could suggest the potential for further instrument development, while if areas of misfit are unique to institutional populations, this could target areas for institutions to investigate more closely. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","",""

Through statistical analysis differences among the three participant groups, how the background characteristics influenced their assessments, and the relationships between characteristics of the content of answers and quality evaluation criteria were each considered in detail. Librarians and nurses shared similar ratings of answer quality, but had differences in their level of medical knowledge and the types of services they offer, resulting in minor differences across criteria. Users perceived the quality of health answers in social Q&A to be higher than librarians and nurses for almost all criteria. Depending on the sources of information presented in health answers, librarians, nurses, and users gave different quality assessments.

This paper discusses how these major challenges are addressed by means of ICT-enabled system innovations in public services. Recent developments in ICT enable the realisation of novel solutions for public transport that can be subsumed under the headline of intelligent transport systems (ITS). However, while the advances in information and communication technology are very fast, the transformation of transport systems and infrastructures tends to take a long time. In parallel, public sector reforms of the past decade, often characterised by the introduction of New Public Management principles, have changed the organisational and institutional conditions for transport service provision and innovation, with the private sector playing an increasingly prominent role. Public-private innovation networks in services (ServPPINs) have been suggested as a concept to foster the realisation of system innovations. This paper analyses the conditions, determinants and instruments for managing ServPPINs successfully, by comparing four cases of ServPPINs in intelligent transport systems, which all aim at establishing system innovations. The four cases are: ITS Vienna Region, a dynamic intermodal traffic information service; compano, a novel ride-sharing scheme in Austria; SIS, a real-time traffic information services, displays and management system in Oslo; and Flexus, an electronic ticket system for public transportation in Oslo. The paper shows the importance of organisational and institutional conditions of ServPPINs for realising these system innovations, and the crucial role of entrepreneurial individuals, both in public and private sector organisations. It also points to the importance of making clear strategic choices at the right moments in time in the course of the life-cycle of ServPPINs. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

First, we offer a comprehensive measurement of advances in digital government that is not circumscribed to a single domain (e.g. administrative procedures of public administrations) but is rather aimed to capture a wide spectrum of public e-services (e-government, e-education, Intelligent Transport Systems, e-health). Second, we tackle a major drawback of existing statistics and benchmarking studies which are largely based on the count of services provided online, by including more sophisticated indicators on the quality of services offered and on back office changes. The results - both in terms of scores and regional rankings - highlight the presence of different patterns of adoption and use of public e-services at the local level.

In many cases, teachers present the only opportunity for students to develop information literacy proficiency. With semi-structured interviews, this study explored eight secondary teachers' perceptions of information literacy and their experiences with IL as educational professionals. Confusion around the phrase information literacy was a dominant theme as participants were unfamiliar with the term and were inconsistent in defining the scope of what it might mean. Although there are references to information literacy skills in the core curriculum and support documents, participants varied in their instruction and understanding of this skill set. Participants unanimously agreed that information literacy skills, as explained using the Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Standards for Higher Education (ACRL, 2000), were important for their students. However, the extent of IL skills required varied by student. Pursuing post-secondary studies warranted advanced IL, and these students were more likely to be taught higher-level skills. IL skill development was also assumed to be the responsibility of the student, and passive acquisition was anticipated. Assumptions regarding student need and ability informed instruction. These results suggest that the current curricular mandates are insufficient to ensure IL is incorporated into instruction and that teachers are ill-prepared to instruct IL effectively. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","",""

The article describes the cost reductions that can be achieved when a co-investment scheme is used, as well as the relationship between market shares and the cost per home connected. A cost model was employed to calculate the investment per home passed and the investment per home connected. The investment per home passed for an alternative operator indicates significant cost reductions when a co-investment scheme is used. On the other hand, the results show that when the incumbent's market share is equal or higher than the total market share of all the alternative operators that share the network infrastructure, the investment per home connected for an alternative operator is higher than that for the incumbent operator. Moreover, to be cost competitive with the incumbent operator, the necessary market share that each alternative operator should achieve is much lower than that of the incumbent operator. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Co-investment; Cost model; FTTH; Network sharing; PON",""

The applied approach combines network deployment, user demand levels, cost, and capacity issues, which are integrated in the application in the opportunity cost approach for spectrum. The opportunity cost of spectrum is compared with prices paid at spectrum auctions. The analysis includes a discussion of drivers that determine the willingness to pay for spectrum.

The telecommunications sector has played an important role in stimulating economic growth in the country during the last few years, with an annual growth rate higher than that of other sectors. This contribution is supported to a great extent by the rapid diffusion of telephony, in particular cellular telephony, as the number of subscribers increased from just 2.1 million in 1999 to 170 million in 2011. Previous studies investigating the impact of the telecommunications sector on the economy aggregate the impact of the sectors on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) without further scrutiny of what sources of growth telecommunications has contributed. Hence, an interesting question arises as to whether the achievement of cellular diffusion is also followed by structural change in the telecommunications sector. That said, this study aims to decompose the output of telecommunications into several sources of growth: domestic final demand, export effect, import substitution effect and technological coefficient effect. A particular interest in this study is to compare the source of growth concerning domestic final demand and the technological coefficient effect. The main tool for analysis in this study is the Input-Output (IO) method, while the time series of the investigation covers the period 1975-2008, allowing comparison of structural changes in the telecommunications sector between the pre- and post-cellular eras. The study found that the coefficient multiplier of the telecommunications sector, which was approximately 1.8 during the 1980s, had decreased to only 1.3 by the end of 2008. Consequently, the final demand from the telecommunications sector contributed less to economic output in the late 2000s compared to the impact in the 1980. Moreover, the cellular era that started in the early 2000s also brought about a trend of changes in telecommunications output. While final demand remains very dominant, the technological coefficient effect has diminished as the source of telecommunications output. This finding indicates a lower ability of the telecommunications sector to build an inter-industry relationship with other sectors. A possible explanation for this result is the cellular uses which are much less related to business activities than that of fixed telephony dating back to the 1970s in Indonesia. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Decomposition; Growth; Indonesia; Input-Output; Telecommunication",""

In addition, this paper presents a discussion on the policy instruments derived from econometric results. Although repealing the horizontal integration cap in the cable TV industry could generate economies of scale, doing so may encourage monopolization over several franchises. The efficacy of intra-platform competition is reserved only for certain cases.

Should they keep the usual forward looking long-run incremental cost standard charge, or should they move to some different approach? The authors propose to price copper access based on the modern equivalent asset (MEA) of fiber access. Since fiber access is superior to copper access, the cost of fiber access (as a basis for pricing copper access) should, however, be corrected by the performance delta between copper and fiber access. Instead of using quality of service (QoS) differences, the authors determine the performance delta based on the market valuation of services provided over the copper and fiber access represented by the end-user prices of services and corrected by cost differences downstream of the access provision. Under this approach an access seeker becomes indifferent (on the margin) between using the copper or the fiber access network and wholesale pricing (or regulation) becomes competitively neutral towards technology choice between copper and fiber access and does not distort the platform competition towards cable. To test its practicability numerical simulations of the approach are performed by means of a quantitative competition model. The model analysis suggests that the approach leads to unique and robust results. Its main conclusion is that the method tends to be conservative relative to the theoretical case of pure vertical product differentiation, meaning that the measured performance delta underestimates the theoretical performance delta. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Copper access; Fiber to the home (FTTH); Long-run incremental costs (LRIC); Modern equivalent asset; Performance delta",""

In doing so, it looks at the characteristics of the two countries in terms of competition and entry of new operators, at the motivations behind the entry of MVNOs, and at the performance of different companies. Results show that the most successful MVNOs are those characterized by the ability to find a perfect match between their core competencies (large network management, strong brand reputation) and the needs of specific segments of demand that had not been previously fulfilled. In this context, companies with ICT network management skills, whether coming from the telecom sector or from other network-based service industries such as postal operators, have been particularly successful in the market. From a policy perspective, despite the failure of some MVNOs, customers have benefited from the increased competition between MNOs and MVNOs in terms of range of service offerings and prices. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the important properties of this network structure is referred to as social capital, which is the network of contacts and the associated values attached to these networks of contacts. This study provides empirical evidence of the influence of social capital and performance within the context of academic collaboration (coauthorship) and suggests that the collaborative process involves social capital embedded within relationships and network structures among direct coauthors. Association between scholars' social capital and their citation-based performance measures is examined. To overcome the limitations of traditional social network metrics for measuring the influence of scholars' social capital within coauthorship networks, the traditional social network metrics is extended by proposing two new measures, of which one is non-weighted (the power-diversity index) and the other (power-tie-diversity index) is weighted by the number of collaboration instances. The Spearman's correlation rank test is used to examine the association between scholars' social capital measures and their citation-based performance. Results suggest that research performance of authors is positively correlated with their social capital measures.

The former is considered to be a predictor of student academic achievement while the latter is considered a key factor in developing information literacy self-efficacy. Today, many students undertake paid employment in conjunction with their academic studies and little is known about the effect this may have on their information literacy self-efficacy and academic motivation. As such, the relationship between information literacy self-efficacy, academic motivation, and employment has been unexplored. Data were collected via a questionnaire, comprised of existing scales, which was administered to undergraduate business students in an Australian higher education (HE) institution. A response rate of 58% resulted in 585 completed questionnaires. Findings suggest that whether or not students were engaged in paid employment did not appear to influence information literacy self-efficacy, although students in paid employment did exhibit significantly lower intrinsic motivation than students not in paid employment. Additionally, for students not in paid employment a significant relationship was found between amount of time spent on study and information literacy self-efficacy. Of some concern, the small amount of time students reported spending in academic pursuits outside of scheduled classes raises issues regarding the placement of information literacy instruction.

Adoption of new technology in rural Iran has been the main challenge and focal point of all agricultural extension activities since the modernization era of the 1950s. Consequently the rapidly growing gap between urban and rural economy has reinforced the critical role of ICT in creating an equal society. Identifying the factors which foster adoption of ICT is among the important challenges of alleviating digital divide. ICT centers attract different groups within rural communities and create a forum for unprivileged rural settlers to learn about and to use computer and internet. This paper attempts to identify the factors influencing the adoption of ICT in rural Gharn Abad's ICT center of Golestan Province. The sample included 218 individuals, who were selected by stratified random sampling method. Survey method was used, and data was analyzed by correlation as well as multiple regression techniques. Based on the results, the existence of ICT center itself, with various funding sources, reinforced the adoption regardless of the users' economic status. At the same time, the other factors such as individual, social, the households' informative & communicative, as well as the innovation related factors were found influential.

In spite of this, however, public pay phones and their revenue are also sharply declining due to the ever increasing encroachment of mobile phone technology. The researcher therefore undertook a study to empirically examine the key determinant factors for individual consumers using public payphones. A discrete choice model is employed together with the analysis of data from a 2011 national survey commissioned by the NBTC. Payphone usage is determined by the ownership of fixed phones, mobile phones and income which all play an important role with payphone being a necessary service for low-income people. Hence, NBTC should continue support through the USO fund and reassess the areas and groups of people who need this service in order to ensure that the USO policy is effectively and beneficially implemented. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

If entrants tend to overinvest, the regulator sets the access price as low as possible in order to prevent or limit infrastructure duplication.

Enormous increases in Eircom's debt levels as a result of the LBOs resulted in the company's bankruptcy in 2012. This paper argues that this outcome was largely attributable to the short-termist strategies adopted by the private equity groups that assumed ownership of the enterprise. These strategies included high leverage, cash extraction and underinvestment in the fixed-line network which contributed to the demise of the enterprise and had wider economic and social effects. The Eircom case demonstrates the risks attendant to ownership of important network infrastructure by private equity groups and the need for regulatory safeguards to protect the public interest. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Part of the holdback on large-scale commercial deployment has been the strategic concern that the commons model to spectrum management lacks the incentives for service providers to invest due to the limited ability to manage interference in the unlicensed band. Today, however, this situation appears to have changed. To explain the new confidence by service providers in commercial Wi-Fi, the activities of the Wi-Fi Alliance and IEEE 802.11 standards body are analyzed to show how these groups essentially replicate many, but not all, of the functions traditionally employed by an effective band manager that is optimizing efficiency on a licensed spectrum block more typically associated with the deployment of commercial services. Consequently, with the Wi-Fi ecosystem functioning as an effective spectrum manager, it is concluded that the service provider investment in Public Wi-Fi networks is rational and the risk posed by saturation or overuse has been reduced to an acceptable level. The strategic implications of this finding on the Wi-Fi platform are the examined. How the requirements from service providers are already significantly influencing the evolution of the Wi-Fi standard is discussed, and an attempt is made to address the risks and liabilities associated with the unlicensed spectrum management model. Thus, service providers increasingly need functionality in Wi-Fi technology to manage interference, and monitor and improve network performance. The current ideas under discussion are elaborated for the next version of Wi-Fi to support both commercial Wi-Fi requirements, which address the interference concerns, but only up to a point, as the unlicensed model intrinsically leaves some risk to participants of spectrum saturation through overuse. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the increasing attention devoted to public e-services only partially captures the extreme variety of aspects and implications of the diffusion of information and communication technologies at all levels of public administrations. The paper aims to develop a meta-analysis of the literature on the delivery, diffusion, adoption and impact of public e-services and examines differences in methodologies, approaches and key indicators across five service categories: e-government, e-education, e-health, Infomobility and e-procurement. We examined 751 articles appeared in 2000-2010 in the top international academic journals listed in the SSCI-ISI, as classified in the following fields: Communication, Economics, Education, Environmental Studies, Geography, Health Policy and Services, Information Science and Library Science, Law, Management, Planning and Development, Public Administration, Transportation and Urban Studies. We highlight a significant heterogeneity in scientific production across service categories, indicators used, and affiliation of authors. We also show an increasing diffusion of quantitative methods applied to different research fields which still appears to be constrained by data limitations. The overall picture emerging from the analysis is one characterized by largely unexplored domains as well as scarcely analyzed issues both across and within individual service categories. Thus many research opportunities seem to emerge and need to be exploited from different disciplinary perspectives in this field of analysis. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Bibliometrics; Innovation in services; Meta-analysis; Public e-services",""

A Scottish Parliament and devolved administration were created in 1999, though without powers over telecommunications or competition law. The Scottish administration has its own economic strategy in which the deployment and adoption of broadband play a part. The creation of new countries has been commonplace in recent years (e.g., in the fission of the USSR and Yugoslavia), but are not precedents for the independence of one part of a regulatory state in which markets deliver services. Less than one-tenth of the UK market would be separated, with all the laws, rules and institutional arrangements to be replicated. The biggest challenge would be to split the existing licences and market operations, one for Scotland and one for the rest of the UK.

Thus, a regulatory non-commitment setting in which the regulator sets the access price after the deployment of the NGA network is used. In particular, it is assumed that the regulator sets the access price at the marginal cost of providing the access with some probability and gives an access markup, which equals the average cost of the investments, with the complementary probability. It is found that when the slope of the marginal investment cost function is not particularly steep in relation to the impact of investments on demand, the incumbent underinvests compared to the socially optimal investment level. On the contrary, in a more realistic case when the impact of investments on demand is low in relation to the slope of the marginal investment cost function, the incumbent may overinvest or underinvest depending on the probability of incorporating an access markup into the access price. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Access regulation; Dynamic efficiency; Investment incentives; Regulatory uncertainty; Social welfare; Telecommunications",""

However, greater proximity increases the risk of service breakdowns caused both by poor interference tolerance in receivers and by inappropriate signals radiated by transmitters. In order to maximize the value of radio operation, a system view that facilitates trade-offs between receiver and transmitter performance is required. However, radio operation has traditionally been regulated using limits on transmitters, with few if any explicit constraints on receivers. This paper brings receivers into the regulatory picture by using harm claim thresholds, that is, interfering signal levels set by the regulator or spectrum manager that have to be exceeded before a receiving system operator can claim harmful interference; the specification of receiver performance (aka receiver standards) is left to manufacturers and operators. The paper explains how harm claim thresholds would be defined from both radio engineering and regulatory perspectives, and outlines how parameter values can be derived for television service and for a new allocation with cellular service in the adjacent band. Harm claim thresholds benefit both radio system operators and regulators by providing greater clarity about the entitlements that are entailed in assignments. They reduce business risk, and allow regulators to delegate both engineering design and boundary adjustment decisions to operators, thus allowing market forces to work more efficiently. These attributes will be particularly useful in bands with many, diverse and rapidly changing services and devices. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Interference; Radio; Receivers; Regulation; Rights; Spectrum; Wireless",""

A key feature of the auction design proposed by the regulator TRAI is the benchmarking of the reserve price of 1800 MHz to the price of 2100 - 3G spectrum revealed in the 2010 auction. In the context of the low number of LTE devices available and the fragmentation in the 1800 MHz band, this paper proposes reducing the duration of spectrum holding to ten years (from the current level of twenty years), and calibrating the reserve price of 1800 MHz with its value with GSM deployment. An economic model is used to compute the value of startup and incremental 1800 MHz spectrum. The estimated values are shown to differ from the value of 2100 MHz spectrum at a pan-India level and also in their distribution across circles.

That time span coincided with tumultuous political, social and economic transformation inside Korea including the growth of such powerful chaebol industry groups as Samsung, LG and SK. Globally, the period covered by this study featured the growth of new and more powerful digital networks epitomized by the internet. It also marked South Korea's transition from a development to a network state, allowing assessment of what the experience implies for developmental state theory. This research shows that the most convincing explanation for the decline of the Korean developmental state lies in its transformation into a network state. Nevertheless, it illustrates the continuing explanatory power of key concepts from the developmental state model, including a competent bureaucracy, a political system that allows the bureaucracy sufficient autonomy, market conforming methods for state intervention, and a ""control tower,"" to guide industrial policy in the networked era. Korea's success suggests the value of technically trained leaders in the ICT sector, and in sharp contrast with Japan, the importance of the cross cultural experience and global outlook that many of them gained while studying at top universities in the U.S. For most of the three-plus decades in this study, the MIC served as Korea's control tower for the ICT sector, guiding policy and technology projects, and culminating in the 2006 U-Korea Master Plan, an ambitious blueprint for becoming the world's first ubiquitously networked nation. However, only two years later the Lee Myung-bak administration dismantled the ICT control tower in favor of a five year experiment with a liberal, market oriented approach to the ICT sector, much like policy in the United States. It was widely considered a failure and in 2013 President Park Geun-hye restored the control tower function within the new ""super"" Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning. The Korea experience also has more general implications for policymakers in the information age. These include the need for national, long-term policies, the vital role of education, ranging from highly specialized R&D to broadly-based public-private sector efforts to ensure demand for services. While Korea's past success depended heavily on the manufacture and export of hardware and infrastructure, the President Park Geun-hye administration, with its emphasis on building a ""creative economy"" signaled recognition that software, content and services will be more important than hardware in the future. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Chaebol; Developmental state; Digital convergence; Governance; ICT4D; Innovation; Restructuring",""

In recent years they have invested in IPTV platforms and launched their own IPTV services. This has brought a new question on the regulatory agenda: shall network operators be obliged to offer wholesale access to their IPTV platform? And if yes, should the new wholesale IPTV product be regulated in the same way as traditional wholesale access? Or should traditional regulation be modified? While the majority of countries have so far no regulatory rules in place, some national regulators have started to become active in this market segment. In order for alternative network operators to realise multiple play offers including IPTV they must be able to match the offers of the incumbent operators. Such replicability with respect to telecoms infrastructure is in principle no problem as long as regulatory rules on local loop unbundling and related facilities are in place. But what if incumbent operators are neither required to offer unbundled access to their FTTH local loops nor do alternative network operators have access to sub-loop unbundling? It is for this reason that many argue some form of direct access to the incumbent multicast equipment needs to be provided. Otherwise the provision of IPTV services will be restricted to large network operators. The paper demonstrates that the regulation of wholesale access to IPTV depends above all on country specific conditions. Ex-ante regulation of access to wholesale broadband services over any DSL technology and any transport technology (ATM and Ethernet) in the sense that the SMP operator is obliged to offer a multicast functionality that allows competitors to offer TV services should be bound to a number of requirements: (1) the demand characteristics such as demand for bundled products. A precondition for determining regulatory obligations with respect to the provision of wholesale access to IPTV platforms should be that multiple play offers are the dominant form of providing telecom services. (2) The lack of cable TV operators exerting competitive pressure at the retail level for triple play products. (3) A lack of LLU in the country, so that alternative operators need a multicast WBA access to offer multiple play services. The paper is organised as follows. The first section of the paper briefly describes the technical and market characteristics of wholesale IPTV access. The second section considers the impact of IPTV wholesale access regulation on competition, investment and broadband diffusion. The third section examines regulatory issues concerning access to wholesale IPTV in more detail. The final section gives key recommendations for a regulatory strategy on wholesale broadband access to IPTV. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Broadband; Fibre network; IPTV; Regulation; Wholesale access",""

We estimate a structural model of household's demand for access to: (i) fixed-line only; (ii) mobile only; and (iii) both fixed-line and mobile. We find that growing Internet usage increases the share of 'fixed + mobile' households, which suggests that households keep their fixed-line connection to access Internet. However, the spread of 3G and cable broadband access decreases the share of 'fixed + mobile' households and increases the share of 'mobile only' households. Hence, fixed-to-mobile substitution was slowed down by the spread of Internet but it may continue with the spread of mobile broadband. Furthermore, bundling of telecommunications services increases the share of 'fixed + mobile' households and decreases the shares of 'mobile only' and 'fixed only' households. Therefore, operators which can bundle fixed-line connection with Internet or mobile services may slow down fixed-to-mobile substitution. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Bundling; Fixed-to-mobile substitution; Internet; Mobile broadband",""

These include Afghanistan, Australia, Brazil, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, Sweden, UK and USA and the European Union as a whole. Despite the initiatives of developing countries, the broadband gap in terms of deployment and adoption between them and developed countries is increasing. There is recognition that there are significant challenges in designing the institutional infrastructure required for broadband deployment, which are accentuated in a developing country context due to the weak existing institutional environment. But since the impact of telecom and, broadband in particular, is more significant in developing countries than in developed ones, policy makers in developing countries are increasingly focusing on National Broadband Plans (NBPs). For example, policy makers in India realize that broadband can accelerate the increasing contribution of the service and knowledge sectors to India's economy and also help to alleviate its poor physical service delivery in areas such as health, education, banking, etc. and have adopted a broadband plan. This paper documents the development of the Indian NBP. Based on prior studies, we identify key factors that contribute to success of broadband deployment and adoption and based on these, we assess the Indian NBP. Further, it uses the framework of multiple streams (Kingdon, 1995) to critique the policy formulation and agenda setting aspects of NBP in an emerging economy. We also highlight the key differences in the policy making processes in developed and developing economies. Given the inter-linkages and complexities of implementing a broadband strategy, we identify the role and attributes of a policy entrepreneur that are critical to evolving the policy, in a developing country context and how these differences lead to the primacy of the role of policy entrepreneur. Thus, the contribution of this paper is in assessing the Indian NBP and providing insights in theoretical aspects of policy making in the realm of broadband in emerging economies, an area that has received little attention. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Broadband; Developing countries; National broadband plans; Policy entrepreneur; Policy making",""

Taking the Swedish market as the case, the result shows that each type of adopters has a different diffusion pattern as a result of different saturation levels and delay factor for diffusion growth.

Therefore, EU regions should spend more money to overcome regional weaknesses than to improve existing assets. In this paper we explore the different strategies of the EU's lagging regions through the analysis of the allocation of 2007-13 Structural Funds. Then, we verify whether such strategies respond to territorial conditions by comparing strategic choices made with the actual characteristics of local contexts. Results show that EU regions tend to invest more resources in those aspects in which they already demonstrate good relative performances.

Two different kinds of investment sharing contractual forms are analyzed, a basic investment sharing, where no side-payment is given for the use of the NGN between co-investors, and joint-venture, where a side-payment is set by the co-investing firms. Results show that investment sharing can potentially be beneficial in terms of competition and investments, but the number of firms involved matters and so does the choice of the NGN access price, for insiders and outsiders of the agreement. Even when the presence of firms outside of the agreement force insiders to compete more fiercely, there might be a concern with the potential exclusion of the outsiders from the NGN. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Access pricing; Investment; Keywords; New technology; Regulation; Risk sharing",""

The analysis revealed that participants constructed their mental models of MedlinePlus based on the schemas that they have of information-rich web spaces. The model construction process involved changes and development in three parallel dimensions: cognition, emotion, and behavior.

The analysis is based on a survey of plans and tariffs conducted by the authors during Q2 2010. Their results suggest that fixed broadband services in LAC are generally expensive and of poor quality when benchmarked against Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, although there is significant variance between markets in the region. In order to isolate the effect of prices on broadband adoption they use an instrumental-variable approach. Their findings show that broadband demand is relatively elastic to price in LAC but not in the OECD. They estimate that an average price reduction of 10% would result in an increase of almost 22% in the penetration rate in LAC, equivalent to almost 8.5 million additional broadband connections. Several policy implications result from these findings. First, national broadband policies in LAC should pay a closer attention to a deficit of competition in fixed broadband services, as households and firms face high prices for poor quality services, thus deterring adoption. Second, while their findings generally suggest that price reductions could significantly increase penetration, they elasticity estimates reveal that price effects might not be sufficient to achieve the penetration goals set in national broadband plans. This validates the need for complementary policy strategies that affect other determinants of broadband demand. The example of Brazil is used to illustrate this finding. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Broadband; Latin America; Price elasticity; Tariffs",""

While educational impact is likely to be the primary objective, such investments can also affect residential adoption and adult utilization of ICT in the communities, thereby reducing the digital divide. Using a census survey of Thailand for a time when ICT was available in roughly half of the nation's schools, this study employs logistic regression and propensity score matching (PSM) to show that placing ICT in schools does have significant spill-over effects outside schools. This effect is larger for ICT in primary schools than secondary schools, and larger in schools with both Internet and computers than schools with just computers. The effects are observed in households of all incomes and educational levels. Considering these spill-over effects when allocating resources should lead to greater welfare gains for the amount of resources spent. The study also finds that there is a sizable portion of the adult population that chooses not to use ICT even after adopting this ICT in their households for their children, thereby eliminating any barriers to use related to cost and convenience.

Furthermore, it investigates the extent to which personal and mobile appliance characteristics explain variance in actual MI use intensity. Data on two demographic variables, three MNO relationship characteristics and actual MI use intensity (average monthly volume of mobile IP traffic generated by a subscriber in May and June 2011) of 9321 adult consumers with a flat MI pricing scheme are extracted from customer files of the German subsidiary of a large international MNO. 959, 2213, 2410 and 3739 of the sample members use an Apple iPhone 3, an Apple iPhone 4, a model running with Google's Android operating system (OS) and other Ml-enabled mobile OS/phone types, respectively. Compared to the adult population in Germany, persons at least 50 years of age are clearly underrepresented among MI adopters with the four studied device types. Differences between the four phone type groups with regard to gender, age, time from enrollment and MI use experience emerge as statistically significant, but they achieve only minor substantial relevance. MI use intensity is highly positively skewed: In each of the four appliance groups, a small number of users disproportionately add to the total MI traffic generated by the subjects. Consumers' advanced OS/handset type strongly contributes towards explaining MI use intensity variance. iPhone subscribers generate more traffic than Android customers who in turn show a higher MI activity level than individuals running other web-enabled mobile models. Age is the only studied personal characteristic consistently showing a (negative) association with MI usage, which both is statistically and materially significant. Conclusions are drawn for MNO on MI marketing issues. Implications of study limitations for research on MI adoption and use behaviors on the MI are also outlined. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Advanced mobile handset types; Android; Apple; Consumer characteristics; Mobile Internet; Mobile phone operating system; Tariff type; Use intensity",""

The private commons model introduced by FCC in 2004 allows spectrum licensees to provide secondary access to spectrum on an opportunistic basis while retaining ownership. Since wireless communication systems are typically overprovisioned in order to deliver service-level guarantees to (primary) users under short-term load variations, this model bears significant potential by facilitating utilization of temporal and spatial surplus of capacity through serving secondary users at possibly different service levels. A potential barrier to adoption of the private commons model is the uncertainty about secondary price-demand relationship which is difficult to predict in an emerging market: A selected price for secondary access may be profitable for some values of secondary demand but not for others, leading to a profound uncertainty about ultimate benefit of spectrum sharing. This paper aims to eliminate such an uncertainty by devising concrete guidelines and methods for profitability. The paper establishes that the price of secondary spectrum access can be chosen to guarantee profitability for any value of secondary demand: It is shown that for both the coordinated and uncoordinated commons regimes a profitable price should exceed a threshold value, which can be calculated. Hence profitability of private commons is insensitive to the demand function. This observation has two complementary interpretations: From a business perspective it provides a constructive approach to profitability; and from a regulatory perspective it provides reassurance that private commons is a healthy model. The paper also leverages the insensitivity property and outlines a technique to further enhance revenue via iterative spectrum offerings. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Pricing; Private commons; Secondary spectrum access",""

Nowhere are these dynamics more pronounced than in China, where a wide range of economic and institutional factors characterize the highly uneven state of informatization2 throughout the country. Through a case study on Guangdong Province, China, this paper offers an in-depth examination of institutional issues in rolling out advanced information services (such as Internet) in rural China. The experiences from Guangdong help identify a number of systemic issues: (1) inefficient and wasteful spending resulting from interdepartmental rivalry (2) lack of policy continuity and institutional learning (3) lack of accountability and credible measurements (4) central planning resulting in gap between services and local needs. This paper calls for more emphasis on outcome assessment and coordination. First of all, in order to reduce waste and more fully exploit the benefits of system-wide reform, the incorporation of better assessment methods into policy measures should precede large-scale network rollout. Meanwhile, high level officials should be appointed to coordinate various departments and legislation may help to achieve coordination and policy continuity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","China; Digital divide; Rural informatization; Universal service",""

A user study was conducted to track traveling paths using the RFID system. Three undergraduate students carried a reader/writer and explored information sources in a library to complete a given set of tasks. Data regarding the traveling paths and information sources used were collected. The information offers insight into participants' information-seeking patterns. For example, all participants started in the online public access catalog zone; they used secondary sources for fact-based tasks more than for topic-based tasks. In addition, they spent the most time exploring the general book zone. A small percentage of tag recordings had to be removed or created because of errors in transmission readings; however, the procedure and results of the experiment were not affected.

The everyday information behavior of older adults' is examined, and the activating role of the media thereon-that is, the use of television, radio, newspapers, magazines, and the Internet. Enactment, an evidence-based concept, is introduced as a theoretical tool that refers to the phenomenon of information and media use leading to action in concrete daily activities. The research strategy was qualitative, consisting of content analysis of semi-structured interviews of 13 retired teachers and the media diaries of 306 older adult Finns. Fifteen categories of information and media use were proposed and grouped into four forms of enactment on the basis of their temporal nature, namely, direct or indirect engagement: 1) general routines and housework, 2) healthy lifestyle, 3) cognitive tasks, and 4) interaction with others. Enactment takes place when older adults' everyday information behavior leads to observable actions, such as organizing their daily activities, preparing food, exercising and engaging in healthy activities, practicing language skills, or filling in crossword puzzles. These findings support the notion that use of information and the media can motivate older adults to stay active in life. Therefore, the concept of enactment may prove useful in gaining a better understanding of certain physical, cognitive, and social aspects of everyday information behavior and their impact on people's well-being.

The secondary spectrum market discussed here is organized by a central entity called the spectrum broker. The auctioned spectrum appears in blocks of available DVB-T channels with some transmit power constraints set-up to protect the primary users (DVB-T receivers). The bidders are institutional spectrum operators (telecommunication companies or service providers), operating in a given area. These players are characterized by heterogeneous demands concerning the spectrum bandwidth, the operation period with temporarily-exclusive rights for using the spectrum and the transmit power needed for successful transmission. Thus, the auctioned objects are non-identical and present different value for different players. Two auction models are proposed. The first one is the simultaneous auction in time domain and combinatorial in frequency and power dimension. The second proposed auction is fully combinatorial. Simulations results are also provided showing effectiveness of the analyzed auctions (high spectrum utilization ratio) and relation between the players' satisfaction, their spectrum valuation and varying competition. Finally the guidelines concerning the spectrum auctions in TVWS for the policy makers are proposed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Spectrum auction; TV white spaces",""

In this study, it is sought to investigate the extent to which the mobile phone would replace or reinforce teens' traditional Internet use through computers. Surveys were conducted on 1875 youths between 12 to 17 years old in 5 digital cities in East Asia: Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, and Tokyo. The findings profile a digital generation that is highly connected in the 21st century. Ninety percent of all respondents used the Internet. Almost 90% of the teens in this study used the mobile phone, and two-thirds of them ever surfed the Web via their mobile devices. Through a factor analysis, three dimensions of teens' use of mobile Internet were identified, namely, task-based activities, information seeking and communication activities, and recreational activities. In general, the teens tend to use the mobile phone for recreation and entertainment purposes, especially playing games and listening to music. They are less likely to use the mobile phone for more sophisticated purposes, such as petitioning, voting, or shopping. Drawing upon the niche theory, the patterns between teens' mobile Internet and PC Internet use were further compared. Our analysis shows that mobile Internet primarily serves as an extension of teens' Internet activities via PC, rather than as a replacement.

However, health-related information and services have a lower profile than other services due to a perceived lack of librarian expertise in searching and evaluating health resources. Although public library users are actively seeking health information, it has become critical for both public librarians and users to develop skills for using and evaluating Internet health resources. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify a set of useful criteria to evaluate online health web sites for both librarians and library users. From a comprehensive literature review, 33 criteria related to health website evaluation were identified. Using this set of criteria, South Korean public librarians and users were asked to rate the importance of each criterion in surveys. A strong consensus was found between the two groups. The top 10 most highly rated criteria from both groups were identified and compared. The results led to the development of an initial set of 12 evaluation criteria for health websites. It is expected that the final set of criteria will be used by public librarians to recommend the best health websites to their users.

Even if incumbent carriers continue to provide basic telephone services via wireless facilities, they will benefit from substantial relaxation of common carriage duties, no longer having to serve as the carrier of last resort and having the opportunity to decide whether and where to provide service. On the other hand, incumbent carriers may have underestimated the substantial financial and marketplace advantages they also will likely lose in the deregulatory process. Legislators and policy makers also may have underestimated the impact of no longer having the ability to impose common carrier mandates that require carriers to interconnect so that end users have complete access to network services regardless of location. This paper will identify the potential problems resulting from prospective decisions by National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs), such as the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC), to grant authority for telecommunications service providers to discontinue PSTN services. The paper also will consider whether in the absence of common carrier duties, private carriers providing telephone services, including Voice over the Internet Protocol (VoIP), voluntarily will agree to interconnect their networks. The paper will examine three recent carrier interconnection issues with an eye toward assessing whether a largely unregulated marketplace will create incentives for carriers to interconnect networks so that consumers will have ubiquitous access to PSTN replacement and other broadband services. The paper concludes that private carrier interconnection models and information service regulatory oversight may not solve all disputes, or promote universal service public policy goals. Recent Internet interconnection and television program carriage disputes involving major players such as Comcast, Level 3, Fox, Cablevision and Google point to the possibility of increasingly contentious negotiations that could result in balkanized telecommunications networks with at least temporary blockages to desired content and services by some consumers. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Common carriage; Deregulation; Information service; Interconnection; Peering; Public switched telecommunications network; Telecommunications service; Universal service",""

However, adjusting to life in a different country can be stressful and require significant effort. Sojourners need to not only maintain and expand their social networks, but they also continuously seek information about their new environment. While international students are a sizable group, their daily information behavior is not well understood. This study posits that social networking sites (SNS), such as Facebook, may play an important role in international students' everyday life information seeking (ELIS). Using descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and structural equation modeling (SEM), the study analyzed international students' everyday life information needs, their usage of SNS for ELIS, and the relationships among demographics, personality traits, SNS usage, and perceived usefulness of the acquired everyday life information. Findings indicate that a majority of the respondents frequently used SNS for ELIS. Younger students, undergraduates, and extroverts were more likely to use SNS for ELIS, while no gender difference was found. Notably, among the nine user characteristics and behavior factors, SNS usage emerged as the only positive predictor of perceived usefulness of acquired information in meeting daily needs. This indicates that SNS serve as a valuable channel for purposeful everyday life information seeking. Beyond its social support value, the ELIS value of SNS is a fruitful area for future research. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","",""

Making white space available is certainly useful, but there are other sharing opportunities as well, some of which have been obscured by dangerous misconceptions about the concept of unused spectrum. This paper discusses allowing more devices to operate safely in gray space spectrum, that is spectrum that is actively being used in that transmissions are underway - something many economic models assume is impossible. The paper focuses on primary-secondary sharing, so devices gaining access to spectrum operate on a secondary basis in a way that never causes harmful interference to primary systems. Examples of primary-secondary gray space sharing mechanisms are described in which devices are allowed to share spectrum with broadcasting, radar, and cellular systems. Quantitative analysis shows that it is technically possible to support significant communications among secondary devices in spectrum that is already heavily used by cellular or radar. However, gray space sharing generally causes primary and secondary systems to be more technically interdependent than white space sharing, so different policy and governance structures are needed. Secondary market rules can support gray space sharing in cases where there is a single primary spectrum user, such as a cellular carrier. In cases where technology is static, the regulator may be able to control access for secondary devices. However, in cases with multiple primary users and multiple secondary users of spectrum, as might be seen in bands with radar for example, a new kind of governance body will be needed to facilitate spectrum sharing. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Cellular; Gray space; Primary-secondary sharing; Radar; Spectrum; White space",""

It is envisaged that cognitive radio systems (CRS) could impact many aspects of communications and in particular could facilitate accommodation of the increasing amount of services and applications in wireless networks. Intensive research on CR aims at maximising the utilisation of the limited radio spectrum resource. There have been many advances in CR regarding the technology development aspects; however supplementary research on regulation, policy and market structure reforms in relation with application specific deployment is still required before any CR-based spectrum access could be implemented for specific broadband mobile applications. Indeed, mobile community is still at an early stage of understanding and development of CR capabilities and it is premature to envisage wide deployment of CRS without careful consideration of regulatory and business issues. Therefore, this paper gives a classification of CR-based network and application scenarios, and investigates the feasibility of them from a regulatory perspective at a global level (ITU-R).

To date, little research has examined emotional labor in library work, even though strong evidence exists to suggest emotional labor is a key component of many library jobs. Research on emotional labor shows that there can be positive and negative effects on individuals such as job satisfaction and job burnout. Research also shows that the negative outcomes from emotional labor may be buffered to some extent by factors such as support from the organization, or job autonomy. Individual differences such as personality traits and attitudes toward customers also impact the effects of emotional labor on employees. Because emotional labor is a critical issue in library work, and because evidence suggests positive outcomes can be fostered, there is a need to study how emotional labor is carried out in libraries, and to identify management techniques for emotional labor that will yield positive outcomes for both employees and organizations.

Geographical information systems (GIS) have been used to investigate library service areas, to aid initial location decisions, and to model the implications of the opening and closure of library services. Recent studies have promoted the use of GIS-based techniques to investigate spatial variations in accessibility to public and private services in relation to socio-economic characteristics of population groups. One such technique, based on floating catchment area (FCA) approaches, has been primarily used to investigate potential inequalities in health services, access to employment and leisure opportunities, as well as planning public transport. In this study, FCA techniques are used to research variations in accessibility to public library facilities using bespoke application tools developed within a commercial GIS package. Drawing on a preliminary analysis of variations in accessibility to library services in a local authority area in south Wales, UK, a case study is presented whereby GIS-based models can be used to investigate spatial variations in digital services provision. As a result, provision gaps of such services can be identified. This study's findings help guide national government delivery programs to promote digital inclusion. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","",""

Library use can be regarded as a form of integration within such institutions. A quantitative approach was applied to demonstrate how institutional data can be combined to examine library use and retention at a single institution. Undergraduate student and library use data were analyzed to identify results that suggested associations between library use and student retention. Library use was measured by log-ins to electronic resources, as well as borrowing from the library. The undergraduate students enrolled for the first time in 2010 comprised the population, Sub-group student characteristics, age and socioeconomic status, underwent further analysis. The findings show retained students log-in to authenticated resources and borrow from the library at higher rates than withdrawn students. Mature age students withdraw from the university at higher rates than younger students. Log-ins to authenticated resources increase as students progress over time through their university programs.

In this paper we assess empirically these relationships in some MENA countries. The empirical study is based on estimation of a dynamic panel model with system GMM estimators. There are three main findings. First, our empirical results join empirical literature that find a negative direct effect of financial development on economic growth. This ambiguous relationship may be linked to many phenomenons but there are not yet clear explanations of this puzzle. Second, the estimates reveal a positive and significant direct effect of ICT proxies on economic growth. This implies that MENA countries need to reinforce their ICT policies and improve using of new Information and Communication Technology.

The actual impact of scientific knowledge is commonly measured by how often peer-reviewed publications are, in turn, cited by other researchers. Therefore, how characteristics such as author team seniority, affiliation diversity, and size affect the overall impact of team publications was examined. Citation information and author demographics were reviewed for 123 articles published in. Physical Review Letters from 2004 to 2006 and written by 476 scientists who used the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory's facilities. Correlation analysis indicated that author teams that were more multi-institutional and had homogeneous seniority tended to have more senior scientists.

In this regard, this study uses data collected from interviews with Peruvian telecommunications professionals, policy makers and regional telecommunication experts, which is supplemented by official reports and statistical data to determine the critical success factors for broadband in this country. The four factors derived are; (i) expand the availability of infrastructure, (ii) define a national broadband policy that aligns the interests of stakeholders, (iii) develop effective competition in the broadband market, and (iv) stimulate the demand for broadband services. Through a MACTOR analysis the authors found that the objectives of sharing infrastructure, the further deployment of infrastructure and the development of competition in the market for broadband services are those that generate the most divergence between actors.

This paper analyzes possible reasons for this situation from the perspective of innovation management and economics. The CR innovation process has developed in a complex environment shaped by a combination of technology-push and market-pull forces. This paper shows that this process is being stifled by two barriers emerging from the current reliance of CR technology on opportunistic dynamic spectrum access as the sole means for entry into the wireless market. The technology-push is affected by the barrier of technological complexities linked to the requirement to protect highly sensitive incumbent systems. The market-pull forces are being negated by market lock-in and a strong status quo of well-established wireless players. This paper argues that overcoming these barriers and revitalizing the practical development of CR could be possible with the aid of light-touch governmental intervention. This could take the form of designating a dedicated CR band, which would benefit CR through less strict spectrum access requirements. A vibrant cognitive environment could flourish in this type of band, supporting CR innovation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Cognitive Radio; Cognitive Radio regulation; Radio spectrum; Wireless telecommunications market",""

This study systematically tested the measurement and structural invariance of LibQUAL+® scores in a sample of 1551 undergraduate students, 707 graduate students, and 134 faculty members. Multi-group confirmatory factor analyses showed that full measurement invariance did hold between students and faculty for the complete instrument. Building on the measurement invariance, structural invariance models showed that factor variances were equivalent across user groups, but factor covariances and means differed. Faculty had higher perceptions of Affect of Service and undergraduate students had higher perceptions of Library as Place compared to the other groups. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","",""

The educational choices of students in library and information science (LIS) departments is an important aspect of the process through which they construct their ambitions, plans, and future capabilities, and so research on students' choices and their educational careers as social processes is also important. Through a detailed consideration of case study accounts of students from LIS departments in Greece, the argument for the importance of social and cultural factors in the formation of students' identity is advanced. Data were collected in two research phases using a questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews. Analysis of data demonstrates the complexity of the process of making educational choices, revealing how individual, family, social, and institutional factors interrelate with the ways young people cope with contingencies, and with social and personal relations. How these complex influences facilitate or impede students' trajectories within higher education institutions is also shown, as well as how they act upon the construction of their pedagogic identities. Of considerable significance is the finding that students from lower social class backgrounds tend to form pedagogic identities that are fragile. By contrast, students from families with significant amounts of cultural and social capital are in a position to exploit the academic and social resources of institutions, and to construct embedded identities with a strong scientific basis. More research is needed to illuminate how LIS departments could develop mechanisms to reduce such discrepancies. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","",""

The credibility associated with these media is sometimes contested, and their acceptance into school practices has been debated. Focus group interviews with teachers and librarians in upper secondary schools in Sweden are used to investigate conceptions and experiences of activities involving the critical evaluation of participatory media, with a particular focus on Wikipedia. Three themes are addressed. The first concerns how the teaching of the critical evaluation of sources is organized and comanaged between teachers and librarians. The second describes educators' experiences of print versus digital media, and their worry because students have problems negotiating the information architecture of print media. The third theme deals with conceptions of the credibility of Wikipedia. Four conceptions of credibility are identified: credibility is associated with the control and stability of a source; it is considered to be strengthened when several sources support a claim; it is viewed as situational and partial, rather than absolute; and it is associated with a multiplicity of voices and democratic forms of production. These findings may be used to inform educational activities around credibility and authority in schools by raising self-awareness among educators of various ways to talk about the credibility of sources with both colleagues and students. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","",""

Research on emotional labor suggests that performing emotional labor results in both positive and negative effects on individual outcomes, such as job satisfaction and job burnout. Since affective events are prevalent in library work and evidence suggests positive outcomes from emotional labor can be fostered, the ways emotional labor is performed in libraries should be studied. This research explores the key components of emotional labor: perceptions of display rules and the emotion regulation strategies of surface and deep acting. Data were collected from a sample of American librarians in 46 states from public, academic, special, and K-12 libraries who completed a survey. Bi-variate and multi-variate correlations, as well as ANOVAs, were used to test relationships among emotional labor constructs, job satisfaction, and job burnout. Results show evidence of significant associations with emotional labor among library employees in both the perception of display rules, as well as in surface and deep acting. Perception of display rules showed mixed results with job burnout and job satisfaction. Surface acting was found to be associated consistently with job burnout and decreased job satisfaction, while deep acting strategies were less strongly associated with negative outcomes. Findings suggest that library managers should clearly communicate display rule expectations to employees and work to build staff support to help meet those expectations. Library employees should be aware of occasions when they use surface acting and work to develop stronger deep acting techniques. The study contributes to an understanding of the influence of emotion management in the library workplace. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","",""

Although many studies have identified the determinants of broadband adoption, this study re-examines the determinants by applying Arellano-Bond GMM dynamic panel data estimation with more complete panel data for OECD countries. The estimation can not only closely capture the dynamics of broadband diffusion but also solve an endogeneity problem existing in the estimations of previous studies. The estimation results indicate that content is also a significant factor, in addition to previous broadband penetration and platform competition, as commonly identified in previous studies. This study further examines and compares determinants in different stages segmented by adopter categories proposed by Rogers. The results reveal different determinants in different stages. The key determinants are income, education, and content in the innovator and early adopter stage; platform competition and previous broadband penetration in the early majority stage; and broadband price in the late majority and laggard stage. Governments should thus devise and implement appropriate strategies for the major potential adopters in each stage instead of adopting a one-size-fits-all strategy. The results of this study provide a valuable reference for countries in early stages of broadband development or for those planning or reviewing their strategies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Adopter categories; Broadband; Determinant; Innovation diffusion; OECD",""

However, uncertainties from technologies, business models and regulatory policies hinder the take-off of TV white spaces exploitation. This paper proposes a bicameral (or two-chambered) geo-location database, which allows/supports both free and paid access to the TV white spaces: i.e., one chamber supports free access through opportunistic or geo-location database access; and the other chamber supports paid usage through secondary spectrum trading. Consequently, four technological scenarios for the acquisition of TV white spaces emerge, namely: sensing only, joint sensing and geo-location database access, geo-location database access only, and broker based secondary spectrum trading. An analysis of these scenarios is performed based on a theoretical framework for emerging technology evaluation while considering technological, business models and regulatory dimensions. The analyses show that free and paid access to TV white space complement each other; and that despite considerable infrastructure costs, the bicameral geo-location database is positioned to create viable TV white spaces exploitation value chains; hence have the most optimal technological, business and regulatory prospects. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Bicameral geo-location database; Business model; Regulatory policies; Spectrum broker; TV white spaces",""

A CVM technique is used to estimate median annual household benefits for Minnesota public library services. Results indicate that CVM likely leads to more conservative estimates than ""cost savings"" approaches, which is probably due to the realities of available substitutes and low patron marginal benefits from additional transactions.

Data were obtained from a national survey in 2010 by the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) of Thailand. The bivariate probit model was employed to examine empirically whether accessibility to fixed telephony infrastructure, socio-economic variables and the area of residence have a systematic link to fixed broadband access in the first stage, and then, specific usage, provided access exists, is estimated. Results of this study show that the variables, together with their potential impact, are as follows: fixed infrastructure, income, gender, level of education, age of consumer and residential area. The impact of these factors varies from service to service (i.e. video download, social network, searching and e-mail). The implications for the NBTC are to encourage competition through the infrastructure and to permit more competition in infrastructure development. This could stimulate the growth of fixed broadband access and use. At the same time, the government could also implement policies to encourage more access and usage, for example income subsidization and training program. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Fixed broadband access; Fixed broadband use; Thailand",""

Among several challenges, the establishment of new base station sites becomes challenging and expensive. This study proposes and analyzes critical aspects of a business case where a mobile operator offloads its mobile LTE network by deploying cognitive femtocells. When aided by a sensor network the cognitive femtocell will be able to use frequencies other than the mobile network and hence increase its power to cover outdoor areas and neighbour buildings. This cognitive femtocell strategy will be compared with an alternative strategy where an operator deploys conventional femtocells and has to build additional base stations to meet the traffic demands. The business case analysis illustrates that there is a potential for cost savings when offloading the mobile network with cognitive femtocells when compared to the alternative strategy. It must be emphasized that the studied concept is innovative and that the business case period starts in 2017, hence, parameter assumptions are uncertain. Therefore, as the most important message of this work, sensitivity analysis is used to reveal the most critical aspects of the cognitive femtocell business case. It is found that the most critical parameters regarding the cognitive femtocell are the price for backhauling, the number of users supported and the coverage. Furthermore, an optimal coverage radius for the cognitive femtocell for lowest possible costs is found. Costs related to the fixed sensor network are found to be less critical since sensors are embedded in the cognitive femtocells. Sensitivity analysis is also presented for spectral efficiency, cognitive and conventional femtocell offloading gain, sensor density and price, customer density and price for base station site establishment. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Business case; Cognitive femtocell; Cognitive radio; LTE; Sensor network; TV white spaces",""

Applying the person-in-environment (PIE) framework designed to integrate individual agency and sociostructural factors in IB research, this study used structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the factors influencing a student's frequency of public library usage for schoolwork, leisure, and Internet access. It mapped and merged a nationally representative survey of 13,000 U.S. 12th graders with census tract data and public library statistics. The SEM findings indicate that school information environment, frequency of school library use, race/ethnicity, and home computer availability were among the top three factors affecting public library usage for schoolwork, leisure, and Internet access. More importantly, library service levels had a positive impact on students' library usage in terms of frequency of use. Specifically, even after personal differences such as each student's socioeconomic status and achievement motivation were controlled for, higher service levels in the student's neighborhood public library contributed to more frequent library usage.

While advanced countries have often used centralized planning and coordination methodology to forecast and allocate the associated spectrum blocks to wireless operators for meeting the demand, it is often ad-hoc in emerging markets dictated by market forces. In this paper, Finland and India are taken to represent advanced and emerging markets, respectively. Different policy options and the policy environment in these two countries for spectrum management are explored. A causal model is constructed to represent the different variables that affect spectrum management practices and possible paths forward in these two extreme cases are highlighted. Using the causal model structure, it is hypothesized that (i) the matured markets such as Finland that practice centralized and harmonized spectrum planning are likely to continue their ex-ante policies and opt for the release of digital dividend spectrum and use of spectrally efficient technologies; (ii) the emerging market in India that is characterized by a market oriented ex-poste regulation is a good candidate to introduce secondary markets including flexible opportunistic spectrum access as exemplified by the wide spread adoption of multi-SIM handsets and the practice of national roaming by 3G service providers. Introductions of policies and regulations in these markets to break away from the extant paths are also highlighted. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Cognitive radios; Economies of scale; Inefficient spectrum allocation; Multi SIMs; Secondary spectrum market; Spectrum sharing; Spectrum trading; System dynamics",""

The research reveals that market size, regulatory environment and government policy are the three most important factors influencing the decision to undertake FDI. Furthermore, the main reasons for deciding to enter SSA are for market and profit growth due to saturation in their existing markets, as well as for diversification of risk. They demonstrate the key competencies that South Africa Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) have in navigating the complexities of doing business in institutional voids. The liability of being from the relatively small emerging market of South Africa and operating in a country of institutional uncertainty has allowed South African companies to internationalise into markets that other MNEs will not venture into and thus turn a liability into an advantage. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This index is a metric measuring the information society in a country and consists of three sub-indices which are access, use and skills. It is an improvement of the ICT development index, proposed by the ITU in 2009. The analysis divides the countries into two groups, the developed and the developing, due to major disparities in their statistical data. The criterion used to define the groups was the income, as expressed by the Gross National Income per capita. The impact of a number of influential parameters on the ICT maturity level is evaluated and it becomes obvious that there is a substantial difference in their impact between developed and developing countries.

Geographical digital divide is measured primarily by teledensity at the provincial level. Changes of the geographical digital divide over time are analyzed within the framework of hardware, software, and other factors. Following this analytical framework, mobile or wireless telecommunications has higher potential of equipping the poor and narrowing the digital divide, especially in developing countries. In terms of hardware, the installation cost of wireless technology is often lower than fixed-line telephone services, especially in remote rural areas and/or areas of difficult terrains. The hardware required by users, notably mobile handsets, is also cheaper to own than personal computers (PCs). In terms of software, a greater variety and more flexible packages are often offered for mobile telecommunication services, and most applications on mobile phones are simpler and more user-friendly. Moreover, the requirements of mobile technologies on some other key factors known to affect information and communication technology (ICT) adoption rates are also lower. In particular, the requirements for language, especially English, proficiency and computer literacy are lower. Furthermore, proactive government measures have been implemented in China to narrow the digital divide through supportive policies influencing the factors named above. Under these circumstances, the well-known association between economic growth and widening digital divide (a difficult dilemma faced by governments of most developing countries) has been reversed in China after 2005. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Though the two systems began this period with a somewhat similar ministerial-bureaucratic decision-making model, and faced similar problems of assimilating new interest groups and responding to international pressures, the paper finds that the decision systems in the two countries evolved in significantly different directions. Chinas telecommunications decision-making is significantly affected by the macro level political rearrangement and is more likely to be non-incremental. On the other hand, confronted by an increasingly litigious environment and a more fractious interest group culture, India represents a somewhat classical textbook case of incremental policy making. Nevertheless, numerous challenges remain in both countries, including institutional capacity and excessive regulatory deference to political authority. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","China; Comparative study; India; Policy making; Telecommunications",""

The proposition is that the major reason for nonlinearity in information practices is a continuous shifting of actors' interests, pressures, and concerns.

The results show that symmetric MTR reduction leads to competition growth among operators, forcing every operator to reduce retail prices and, consequently, to enhancing consumer welfare.

To this end they analyse competition between mobile standards in China across two generations (2G and 3G), with the help of essential notions of economics of standards. Different policy initiatives have been taken to stimulate the domestic innovation and to relieve the burden of foreign IPRs, culminating with the introduction of a 3G domestic standard, TD-SCDMA, to compete with the established global standards. Despite the size of the Chinese market and the strong hold of the government on the telecommunications industry, it is found that the available market data indicate that these path-breaking initiatives have not been successful from a commercial point of view.

The results show that quality factors of mVoIP significantly influence the usefulness and ease of use, which subsequently affect the adoption of the technology. Call and service quality were found to be significant factors, followed by mobility and coverage. The policy and managerial implications of mVoIP are discussed based on the model. In conclusion, this study provides in-depth analysis and heuristic data on the consumer drivers, market dynamics, and policy implication within the mVoIP ecosystem. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Fast- growing China Mobile Multimedia Broadcasting services (CMMB) leads China's mobile TV industry and forms the largest network globally. As mobile TV regulation and technology became stable after the initial stage, this study focuses on CMMB's competitiveness in market/industry subsystem. Using document analysis and expert interviews, it analyzes CMMB's institution-driven and market-driven forces in the Chinese 3G/4G telecommunication market. The socio-technical framework is incorpo- rated with seven forces model to examine commercialized CMMB and investigates its market and technoculture in Shanghai. Institutionally, CMMB business structure was collapsed into three levels which managed extensive and diverse Chinese markets strategically through a unified platform. After the business model switched to a subscription model, CMMB's rollout slowed down but turned it into a sustainable business. Besides, analysis of market forces shows CMMB's good market competiveness due to strong support from suppliers, complementors, and distribution channels and little threat from rivals, new entrants, and substitutes. CMMB users have increasing switching cost because of improved content/services and devices and no data charge fee. In contrast, CMMB faces stronger threat from competitors and substitutes and less loyal consumers in Shanghai than on a national level. CMMB's rapid developmental path provides meaningful implications for other countries in establishing mobile multimedia networks. This study recommends a pro-innovative and technology-neutral regulatory approach to develop mobile TV. Finally, the socio-technical model is found useful for analyzing technological development at different stages and contexts. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.","Culture; Market competitiveness; Mobile TV; Seven forcesmodel; Socio-technical approach; Technoculture",""

While various pure service providers enjoy high performance, the products offered by the incumbents often cannot compete on either price or user experience. Conventional wisdom, however, might suggest the opposite: that coordinating both infrastructure and services might allow the incumbents to reap synergy effects and create superior products. To address this issue, this paper applies a complex systems perspective to the telecommunications industry. It conceptualizes telecommunications firms to be searching for good configurations of interdependent service and infrastructure activities that need to fit together to achieve high-performing product systems. Using a simulation model, the paper shows that integrated operators can indeed take advantage of the interdependencies between the infrastructure and the service domain, resulting in superior product performance. Integrating infrastructure and services, however, can backfire: because learning about both domains and their interdependence requires more time, performance in the short run will be lower than that of pure service providers that can focus on adapting their service-related activities to an infrastructure that is beyond their control.

The NBM is a multiagency effort, including the National Telecommunications Administration (NTIA), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), fifty U.S. states and five U.S. territories, to collect and disseminate information on broadband provision and quality of service for the United States. From a geographic perspective, the NBM represents a marked departure from previous broadband data efforts. Specifically, instead of disseminating FCC Form 477 data on providers at the ZIP code or Census tract level, the NBM reports provision information at the Census block level - the smallest geographic unit in which the Census bureau tabulates survey information. While this increased level of geographic data resolution is a welcome change, there are several notable limitations to these data that are important to consider when conducting spatial econometric analysis for public policy evaluation. With this in mind, the purpose of this paper is twofold. First, this paper explores the salient characteristics of Census block geographic base files, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses as summary units of spatial analysis. This also includes a brief discussion on how the NBM treats geographically large blocks and their use of road segments for aggregating provider data. Second, this paper examines the impacts of empty blocks (i.e. blocks that have no household information associated with them) for the spatial analysis of broadband.

They argue that China's approach to standardization has evolved from techno-nationalism to techno-globalism. In building, developing, and maintaining alliances, relatively more weight is placed on links with foreign firms over time than on those with local firms, and China is increasingly open to foreign firms to gain their support and cooperation, which is required for international standardization and commercialization of locally-developed standards.

Spectrum policy is paramount as spectrum is a scarce resource allocated by regulatory authorities. Hence, when allocating spectrum and determining the potential use of spectrum, the regulatory authorities have a significant influence on the competitive situation in mobile markets. Mobile telecommunications services, especially the growing mobile broadband and mobile data business, use different spectrum bands (typically 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz and 2600 MHz). The propagation characteristics of the different bands vary; this has an impact not only on costs for network rollout but also on the relative value of the spectrum, which is expressed in the prices achieved in allocation proceedings such as auctions. In this paper, the impact of spectrum allocation on the network cost is analyzed. The access network costs are considered based on different spectrum allocations and technologies and compared to the acquisition costs of spectrum. Based on economic modeling and previous research, it is possible to demonstrate that the economic differences between spectrum below 1 GHz and above 1 GHz are considerable. As long as these differences are reflected in the prices, no outcomes on competition exist. As spectrum though is allocated and administered by regulatory authorities, this is not on always the case, which might lead to distorted competition. Hence, the finding of the study is that the propagation characteristics of the spectrum is a factor to be considered when allocating spectrum due to its effect on network costs and hence, eventually competition problems due to asymmetric allocation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Performance was measured using an important metric normally used to measure synergies of firms undergoing mergers. The analysis has revealed that the relative cash flow variable for firms worsened after mergers. If the synergy motive had been primary in influencing merger decisions, and also approvals, then the past mergers approved led to decreased performance levels and corresponding welfare losses for American consumers; thus, the mergers of communications common carriers were not in the interest of the public, the shareholders and customers. On the other hand, given the negative outcomes, views that the quiet life, hubris or a quest for possible market power motivated the mergers could be discarded. The lessons of such contemporary historical analysis have suggested that antitrust oppositions to contemporary telecommunications sector mergers may have basis in fact and salient evidence. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Although several accessibility analyses have been conducted of public libraries, these studies tend to measure the distance from the users' homes to the library using straight lines. This generally serves as a poor measurement of actual travel distances. In order to provide more realistic analysis, and measure patterns of library access more accurately, this study employed geographic information systems (GIS), including descriptive and statistical analyses, and a road network-based distance measure. One finding from the GIS analyses was that distance was a determining factor for library use. Specifically, the evidence shows that distance affected a considerable number of registered users who lived within the areas that were defined through Thiessen polygons. Another finding was that there was a difference in the travel distance between ethnic groups: Caucasians went further to access public libraries than other ethnic groups. Finally, in terms of the relationship between distance and demographic data, household characteristics relative to children and education level were significantly related to the travel distance of users. To improve the accessibility of public libraries, this study recommends librarians define service areas for libraries, develop library programs and services for susceptible user groups, and evaluate user groups' needs. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","",""

Patrons move easily between high and low intensive activities and float between life spheres and roles-student, family member, friend, neighbor, and citizen. The library is a complex arena. It is a public realm, in the sense that most of the visitors are strangers to each other; most of the individual uses belong to a private realm, and the library's community activities constitute it as a parochial realm.

This exponential growth might be hindered by a scarcity of suitable radio spectrum, a necessary but limited natural resource required for all wireless communications. Spectrum scarcity does not only slow down data growth, but may also disrupt existing communications. Cognitive radio may provide a solution to these issues, but although the concept seems promising, few products making use of CR have been brought to the market. This is due to significant uncertainties surrounding the appropriate economic scenario for CR, the regulatory framework and the technology enablers needed for such CR scenario. As business, regulatory and technical constraints are largely co-determined by each other, this paper proposes to align them, paving the road for the implementation of specific economic scenarios with appropriate regulation. First, from the business perspective, a taxonomy of possible economic scenarios for CR is proposed. Second, for each scenario a number of regulatory requirements - based on a European context - and characteristics are given. In doing so, it is argued that the economic scenarios are inherently distinct so that CR regulation should be customized for the type of scenario envisaged. Third, from the technology perspective, this article reviews the possible CR enablers, showing that spectrum sensing, CPC and geolocation database all have their strengths and weaknesses, and receive varying support from business and regulators. Based on the analysis it can be concluded that, although the introduction of CR does not seem problematic for the unlicensed scenario and the flexible operator scenario, more complex measures are required to enable CR to contribute to the implementation of spectrum pool - and spectrum market scenarios. It can also be concluded that, out of the three proposed alternatives, the geolocation database is the most likely candidate to be used for CR purposes. However, although this database is a clear favorite for applications within the TV White Spaces, spectrum sensing should not be discarded as a potential CR enabler for highly sensitive applications in high-density radio environments. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Reasons are that flat rates protect against unexpectedly high costs (insurance effect), are more likely to be chosen if actual usage is overestimated (overestimation effect), and prevent any disutility that is associated with the immediate perception of marginal costs (taximeter effect). This study complements the literature on tariff biases by highlighting that a lack of tariff flexibility is a major impediment to choosing a flat rate: empirical support for this flexibility effect is found, while, at the same time, the insurance and overestimation effect that run in favor of flat rates are confirmed. Finally, the managerial implications of the findings for the introduction of the new cost cap tariff are discussed.

A contingent valuation survey was conducted to demonstrate how altruistic motivations affect WTP estimates for public libraries. Approximately 22% of the WTP value was found to be excluded from the total WTP value, because of motivation by local and nonpaternalistic altruistic attitudes.

Strategic planning is widely recognized as a challenging activity, however, which can be both time consuming and unproductive, and there exists limited guidance regarding how to evaluate documented and disseminated strategic plans, particularly within the not-for-profit sector. In response, this research proposes and tests an inspection-based approach to the evaluation of strategic plans, based upon a rubric specifying the key attributes of each of the core components of a plan, combined with an appropriate assessment scale. The rubric provides a method to identify and assess completeness of strategic plan, extending to qualitative assessment of communication aspects such as specification and terminology, and synergistic aspects such as cohesion and integration.

While this has been quite useful in establishing the technical feasibility of DSA systems, it has missed large sections of the overall DSA problem space. This paper argues that the spatio-temporal operating context of specific environments matters to the selection of the appropriate technology for learning context information. It identifies twelve potential operating environments and compares four context awareness approaches (on-board sensing, databases, sensor network, and cooperative sharing) for these environments. In order for operators, regulators, and users to be interested in deploying DSA based networks, the expected costs should be in proportion to what the users are realistically willing to pay for services. Consequently, it is important to conduct cost analysis for different DSA approaches in parallel with the technical research. Regulators and major stakeholders should pay attention to the operating environment of DSA systems when determining which approaches to context learning to encourage. The incremental capital costs; over a basic software radio; have been compared for the four context awareness approaches after an estimation analysis for each cost component. Since DSA is still a relatively new research field, there is a lot of uncertainty associated with incremental cost analyses. As a result, the cost analysis is parameterized to allow for explicit reasoning about the bounds of cost components. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Fixed effects and dynamic panel data models using Chinese regional panel data over the period 2003-2009 show a consistent positive correlation between the mobile market concentration and mobile network investment in the industry. This phenomenon is attributed mainly to the soft budget constraint problem that occurs under asymmetric market competition between state- owned enterprises. It is suggested that the asymmetric competitive structure has been a potential driving force of overinvestment in the mobile network in China; hence, improving the competitive structure by implementing appropriate regulatory policy rather than by policy allowance or inequitable policy burdens would be an effective way to alleviate overinvestment in network facilities.

For the first time, in the present paper a bootstrap approach for the decomposition of labour productivity change, proposed by Kumar and Russell (2002), is employed. This approach permits to conduct statistical inference on the parameters of interest, and to analyse the effects of ICT technologies on capital accumulation. The results confirm the role of ICT as a general purpose technology that needs organisational and business process changes to fully exploit its growth opportunities. The paper also finds out, by applying a non-parametric test, that ICT technologies positively contribute to the generation of convergence clubs in the evolution of labour productivity. Finally, the empirical evidence offers some basic guidance for future policy intervention in supporting ICT capital investments. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Bootstrap; Convergence; Economic growth; ICT; Labour productivity",""

Questions explored how this community assessed the quality of health information, and what cultural values influenced their understanding of its quality. Accuracy and reliability were identified as the two most valuable quality characteristics. A commercial type of webpage was considered as a negative indicator for reliability, while information described in detail or displayed reiteratively was a positive indicator. In addition to functional quality criteria, nonfunctional characteristics such as sympathy were found. Above all, findings highlighted that cultural differences limited the use of health information. Quality based selection of information is an important part of a health information seeking process. Findings can give the designers of Web-based consumer health information systems important insights into how to support evaluation of the quality of health information by consumers, and how to reduce barriers to health information seeking and use caused by cultural differences. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","",""

The analysis here indicates the demand for TFNs is highly inelastic (the coefficient for own price elasticity for TFNs is approximately -0.04). This has implications for concerns regarding future exhaust of toll-free codes and the price structure for recovery of SMS/800s costs. This article considers the effects of the limited property rights for TFN, and welfare implications of gray markets for vanity TFNs. The FCCs allocation mechanism for new 855 codes is considered and whether other allocation mechanisms, such as auctions, could be welfare superior. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper challenges existing dominant views on spectrum assignment and license fee payments, estimates spectrum fees that MNOs would have paid under royalties and then compares them with upfront lump-sum fees actually paid by 3G licensees. This paper further proposes that governments need to consider assigning additional spectrum to incumbents as needs arise without using auctions and adopting royalties as a way of collecting spectrum fees should they collect them. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Five main types of ethnographic research methods were identified: observation, interviews, fieldwork, focus groups, and cultural probes. The survey shows a recent increase in the use of ethnographic methods in libraries, and identifies an emerging genre of studies associated with library planning that uses rapid ethnographic methods to investigate libraries and their users as part of planning processes. The survey supports comparison across ethnographic studies, settings, and methods; enables the growth of ethnographic methods as a research method in libraries; and provides material for library and information science curriculum development in this area.

To aid policy makers in promoting green ICT at the national level, this paper proposes a comprehensive understanding of green ICT from the perspective of green innovation and develops an analytical framework based on innovation system approaches. Following the framework, policy makers can identify the critical system failures of a green ICT innovation system by assessing the key structural components of the system and, hence, formulate policies to solve them. The framework is used to analyze the green ICT innovation system in China. The findings indicate several critical system failures that hamper the development and diffusion of green ICT in China. Accordingly, policies are suggested to address the failures. This paper aids in the understanding of green ICT and contributes to the development of systematic approaches to formulating green ICT strategies. The Chinese experiences provide practical implications, which can be considered by other countries for reference. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.","Environmental sustainability; Green ICT; Green innovation; Innovation system; System failure",""

The 3G strategic network mainly consists of mobile operators, content/application providers, service providers, handset manufacturers, mobile phone dealers, network equipment manufacturers, chipmakers, the government, and customers. Building from the strategic network concept, this paper identifies some of the features of China's 3G market.More new inter-firm ties have been established in the 3G era, while some old ties have been reshaped. Some firms have multiple positions or roles in one strategic network, which results in competition between former partners in the 3G market. Many firms choose to participate in more than one strategic network to exploit scope economies and mitigate the risks of being stranded on a sinking ship. China's government not only determines the initial status of the strategic networks, but also makes policies that affect the evolution of the 3G strategic networks. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.","3G; Industry convergence; Standards; Strategic network",""

The intersection between the academic library's dynamic space and governing policies and guidelines, and the omnipresent mobile phone user is examined. Data was collected through document analysis and 46 ethnographic observations and interviews. How historical precedents, communication incongruence, and a lack of user studies can result in inconsistencies between academic libraries' visions and users' information practices is illustrated. Recommendations for policy-makers and managers of hybridized information centers are made. Specifically, guidelines regarding mobile phones should be revised to reflect a more in-depth understanding of mediated collaboration through mobile phone use. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","",""
