In recent years, increasing a user's objective (i.e., actual) security knowledge and providing applications with more secure default settings appear among the most ubiquitous tools companies use to broaden their efforts to help users make more secure decisions. Examining both solutions matters because they are widely used, cost effective, and understood by many security practitioners. Additionally, default settings and users’ objective knowledge provide anchors for decision-making. However, human errors and insecure default settings are increasing and raising further questions about the efficacy of such efforts. Using the theory of bounded rationality, we investigated the role of objective, subjective (i.e., self-assessed) security knowledge, and default settings security level on the overall decision security. We found that objective security knowledge can lead to secure decisions when paired with high subjective security knowledge. In the absence of the latter, objective security knowledge is unable to lead to better security decisions. Furthermore, subjective security knowledge reduces the extent to which users fully accept default security settings, thereby mitigating bias toward insecure default settings. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Default settings; Information security; Objective security knowledge; Subjective security knowledge; Theory of bounded rationality"

We theorize the different entrance modes and pathways through which the innovation can join the value co-creation structure of an incumbent ecosystem. We further theorize how the innovation entrance can affect the value appropriation arrangements among innovators and various incumbent ecosystem actors. The automobile ecosystems and Google's initial announcement of its autonomous cars serve as our empirical context. Applying our theories, we first qualitatively prescribe Google's potential actions and predict their value implications on the incumbent automobile ecosystem. Then, through an event study, we empirically validate the predictions. We observe that, on average, the incumbent actors of the automobile ecosystem benefited from Google's announcement. Moreover, car manufacturers particularly benefited from Google's attempted entry, arguably because they held critical gatekeeping positions along Google's entrance pathway. Car component manufacturers, but not other incumbent actors, were also able to benefit because of their tight integration with the gatekeepers. Our theoretical development and empirical exploration contribute to the emerging literature on ecosystem strategies by highlighting the dynamics and value implications when innovations are introduced into incumbent business ecosystems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Autonomous car; Business ecosystem; Event study; Innovation; Value appropriation"

Drawing upon the stressor-strain-outcomes framework, we examined how technology-driven stressors affect the elderly's avoidance behaviors. Results indicate that two types of technology-driven stressors exert opposite influences on the elderly's avoidance behaviors through the mediating effect of technology anxiety. Specifically, the elderly's technology-driven challenge stressors exert a positive influence on their avoidance behaviors, while the elderly's technology-driven hindrance stressors exert a negative influence. Moreover, stigma consciousness plays a moderating role in the relationship between the elderly's technology-driven hindrance stressors and technology anxiety by strengthening the positive influence of the elderly's technology-driven hindrance stressors on technology anxiety. Our findings deepen the understanding of the good and bad of technostress and provide implications for older adults, technology developers, and the government. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Avoidance behaviors; Stigma consciousness; Stressor-strain-outcomes (S-S-O) framework; Technology anxiety; Technology-driven stressors; The elderly"

The present study therefore seeks to examine why and how different types of feedback influence users’ behavior in OIC, and the detailed mechanisms underlying such influences. While our results do not show a significant relationship between receiving peer dynamic feedback and user success, we find that receiving sponsor static feedback in users’ first submission is positively associated with their continued participation in OIC. Also, when compared to peer dynamic feedback, sponsor static feedback has a stronger effect on users’ continued participation. Our goal is to confer a holistic picture of how the timing, source, and form of feedback shape user continuous participation and success in OIC. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Online innovation contests (OIC); Peer dynamic feedback; Sponsor static feedback; Uncertainty reduction; User success"

However, the factors affecting behavioral trends and activity levels in these networks are not well understood. Although social and cognitive theories can help to explain human behavior in traditional social networks, their application to SMNs has not been validated. Traditional social network modeling techniques may not accurately predict real-world SMN activities. This research developed a temporal graph framework for intelligence extraction in SMNs. Theory-based, data-driven models (Conformity Model (COM), Recency-Primacy Model (REM), Trend Interaction Model (TIM), Periodic Interaction Model (PIM)) were developed based on the framework to capture various aspects of user behavior: conformity effect, recency, primacy, periodicity, and dynamic trend. The models capture the activity history and dynamically combine pricing information to enhance predictive accuracy. Using data of 83,536 GitHub software repositories on cryptocurrency, this article reports the results of experiments that compare the models’ performance in predicting SMN activities over time. Experimental results show that the model (REM) that captures recency/primacy effects of human cognitive processing outperformed other models in 9 (out of 18) measures pertaining to engagement, contribution, influence, and popularity. Primacy plays a dominant role in predicting engagement, contribution, and popularity, whereas recency plays a key role in predicting influence. Short-term trend (modeled with TIM) was found to yield significantly better performance on predicting user contribution. The models also outperformed an integrated machine learning (IML) model by most measures. Overall, the effects modeled by REM and TIM were found to be more significant than the effects modeled by COM, PIM, and IML. The research contributes to enhancing understanding of SMN behavior, developing new models to simulate and predict SMN activities, and designing new artifacts for information systems practitioners to manage knowledge assets and to extract SMN intelligence. © 2023","GitHub; Modeling; Primacy; Psychological theory; Recency; Social media analytics; Social media networks; Social theory"

The EP can choose either a non-competing outside supplier or a competing inside supplier that sells a high-quality brand product through the EP. Consumers have complete knowledge about the qualities of the two products, although they remain uncertain about which product best meets their need. We find that the EP has an incentive to disclose information when the ratio of the cost per unit quality of the inside supplier's product relative to that of the EP's own-brand product is high, and it prefers the inside supplier when this ratio is low. We identify the EP's optimal strategy profile. Specifically, when this ratio is low, the EP selects the inside supplier and refrains from disclosing information when the ratio is sufficiently low. However, when the ratio is high, the EP selects the outside supplier and discloses information only if the ratio is sufficiently high. We also find that market competition softens both when the EP selects the inside supplier and when it discloses information. © 2023","Game theory; Quality information provision; Supplier selection; Supply chain management"

It is particularly important for humanitarian nongovernmental organizations (HNGOs), whose work relies on accurate and timely information regarding socially altruistic behavior (donations, volunteerism, etc.). Despite the potential of social media for increasing social capital, tensions in governing social media information across an organization's different operational levels (regional, intermediate, and national) pose a difficult challenge. Prominent governance frameworks offer little guidance, as their focus on control and incremental policymaking is largely incompatible with the processes, roles, standards, and metrics needed for managing self-governing social media. This study offers a notion of dynamic and co-evolutionary process management of multi-level organizations as a means of conceptualizing social media information governance for the accrual of organizational social capital. Based on interviews with members of HNGOs, this study reveals tensions that emerge within eight focus areas of accruing social capital in multi-level organizations, explains how dynamic process management can ease those tensions, and proposes corresponding strategy recommendations. © 2023","Dynamic and co-evolutionary process management; Information governance; Social capital; Social media"

If a particular technology is in vogue and seen as a “hype,” clients are under pressure to buy the technology while, at the same time, skepticism about its claimed benefits might be reinforced. Finding a balance between optimism and skepticism is essential. In this qualitative case study, we examine how an oil and gas supplier company in Norway deals with different pressures when adopting and subsequently implementing digital twin (DT) technologies. DTs offer the promise of creating a digital representation of the physical assets that can keep production facilities operating efficiently and optimally and, as such, have been heralded as enabling the next frontier of productivity improvements. Our results reveal a set of different pressures promoting the decision to adopt the hyped technology. Yet, when descended to the local context, the hype status of DTs evokes multilevel perception segmentation that hype interpreters maneuver by building trust. Based on this analysis, we propose a framework of trust-building mechanisms that contribute to a more nuanced understanding of adoption of hyped technologies and enable practitioners to deal with hype-induced perception obstacles. © 2023 The Author(s)","Digital twins; Hyped technologies, Perception segmentation; Management ideas; Oil and gas industry; Trust"

Drawing on the elaboration likelihood model (ELM), this study develops a theoretical framework to examine the mediation effects of cognitive vs. affective trust on the relationship between dual routes (central route vs. peripheral route) and users’ click-through intention in the context of mobile social platforms. Particularly, users’ prior product experience is incorporated in the research model to examine its moderating effect on the influence processes. A scenario-based survey is conducted in China, and the partial least square method is used to analyze the data. Empirical results suggest that perceived content personalization is positively associated with cognitive trust, and its influence is stronger for experienced users with the recommended product. Social recommendation is positively associated with affective trust, and its impact is higher for users without prior product experience. Advertiser reputation is positively associated with both cognitive trust and affective trust, and its effect on cognitive trust is stronger for users without prior product experience, while its impact on affective trust is higher for users with prior product experience. Moreover, cognitive trust is positively associated with affective trust, and the two trust mechanisms have positive influences on click-through intention toward the recommended product.

Following a patronage model, fundraisers on the platform are forced to use compelling stories to capture the attention of individual donors. As such, conceptualizing a persuasive request narrative for projects posted on the platform becomes one of the most pressing issues. Project writing guidelines, as an important platform design, are widely adopted to help fundraisers. Unfortunately, their role in the market has not been well examined. To fill this research gap, we leverage a unique dataset from a leading donation-based crowdfunding platform in the United States and make full use of its policy change opportunity on writing guidelines to thoroughly investigate its impacts and the underlying mechanism on donors’ contributions. Our empirical results show that the more constraints the guidelines impose on writing, the more likely they are to weaken the persuasiveness of narratives. We specifically focus on three aspects of narrative complexity and find that writing guidelines have a negative impact on linguistic complexity, which in turn diminishes donors’ contribution behavior. Nevertheless, they have positive impacts on both content and structural complexity, with the difference being that increased content complexity weakens donors’ contributions, while higher structural complexity is more likely to attract donations. Moreover, we examine the heterogeneous effects of writing guidelines on fundraisers with varied involvements. These findings deepen our understanding of writing guidance design in online platforms and have implications for charitable crowdfunding platforms and fundraisers. © 2023","Mediation effect; Narrative complexity; Online charitable crowdfunding; Online donation behavior; Platform design; Writing guideline design"

Current recommendation methods generally use online consumer reviews or ratings to predict consumers’ preferences for products. In e-commerce transactions, price plays a significant role in consumers’ purchase decisions. And each consumer's preference for product prices is specific. In this paper, we propose a novel price-aware recommendation method based on the matrix factorization model which fully considers the effect of price. We distill the price preferences of consumers from ratings and discover consumers’ real preferences for products. We further calculate the price sensitivities of consumers, not only considering the difference in price preference between a consumer and others but also focusing on the consumers’ price preferences in a specific price range. The final predicted ratings are calculated by adding the term of price effect into the matrix factorization framework. The results show that the proposed method has achieved high accuracy and performed better than several existing methods in both rating prediction and Top-N recommendation. And the products we recommend for consumers are more in line with their price preferences. Moreover, we find that, to some extent, the proposed method can solve the long-tail product recommendation problem with the consideration of the price effect. © 2023","E-commerce; Matrix factorization; Personalized recommendation; Price preference; Price sensitivity"

However, few studies have considered the dynamic fabric of ICT, especially since its usage is evolving with the development of digital technology and the organization's needs. Therefore, this study conducts a case study of a prominent Taiwanese petrochemical corporation, exploring its ICT practices to underscore the dynamic nature of ICT. Additionally, the study introduces a collective enactment model to investigate the development of evolving ICT practices within the organization. Prior literature on ICT development focuses on organizational applications and its novel technology feature. With the evolution of technology, traditional ICT alone is no longer sufficient to meet digital transformation requirements. In other words, organizations need to integrate other enterprise systems in ICT to continually address their current challenges effectively. To investigate the practices under such evolving ICT, this study suggests viewing ICT as a continuously evolving practice to cope with the rapidly changing organizational environment. From a managerial perspective, this study highlights the dynamic feature of ICT, especially the interaction between ICT and organization members. From a theoretical perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of collective action to ICT development so that enactment theory has been extended. © 2023","Collective enactment; Development process; ICT development; Structural embeddedness"

Drawing on systems theory, this study proposes the synergy of these three key drivers in steering digital transformation. Recent data from 206 Dutch firms support the existence of synergy, showing that digital proactiveness, change commitment, and organizational flexibility contribute jointly to digital transformation. Our analysis reveals that the effect of organizational flexibility on digital transformation is highest when digital proactiveness and change commitment are both at a high level.

With the explosive growth of information availability through online channels such as social media, HIC has become a common and growing phenomenon; however, most information systems research to date has focused on factors surrounding information consumption for utilitarian rather than hedonic purposes. In this paper, we take an initial step to inform theory in this area by applying a NeuroIS lens to explore HIC behavior. We postulate that information is more likely to be hedonically consumed when it is appraised as interesting, and that certain characteristics of the information involved in HIC, namely its novelty and valence, play a role in determining its interestingness. Moreover, we hypothesize that HIC is driven by the neurobiological reactions that take place in response to information novelty and valence. We report the results of a behavioral and an fMRI experiment designed to measure the relationship between these information dimensions and neurocognitive responses in the context of a popular social media platform. Our results provide preliminary evidence for differential processing patterns related to novelty and valence that can inform ongoing theory building surrounding HIC behaviors. © 2023","fMRI; Hedonic Information Consumption; Information Interestingness; NeuroIS; Novelty; Social Media; Valence"

Yet, evidence on its benefits is limited, and IT managers are left without a clear guidance on why to implement it. To solve the problem, this article shows the benefits of gamification for overall job performance and the intermediating mechanisms through which it exercises its advantageous effects. It is theorized that employees’ engagement in gamification favorably alters their cognitions, transferring their effect onto employee attitudes and behaviors in the workplace. First, user engagement in gamification alters cognitions about the performance management system, making employees perceive justice, which, in turn, affects their satisfaction with the performance system. Second, user engagement in gamification alters cognitions about the job, influencing the perceptions of job stressors that affect job satisfaction.

The results from fitness app users show that both personal-oriented features and social-oriented features of fitness apps can significantly improve exercise adherence and social engagement of users. Users’ exercise proficiency level negatively moderates the relationship between social-oriented features and (a) exercise adherence and (b) social engagement. High levels of social engagement promote users’ physical adherence to exercises. Exercise adherence and social engagement both enhance users’ subjective well-being, but their impacts on different dimensions of well-being vary. Furthermore, regardless of specific features, sufficient use of fitness apps, in general, can significantly help users lead more positive and healthier lives by maintaining exercise adherence, reducing emotional exhaustion, and improving their satisfaction with the overall quality of life.

Despite considerable interest in seeker feedback, extant literature lacks a thorough understanding of it. This study, in particular, examines how rating feedback can encourage the submission behavior of solvers from three aspects: the level of rating, the dispersion of rating, and the first rating timing. Based on a sample of 37,881 unique observations from 99design.com, empirical analysis indicates that the level of rating has a curvilinear effect on a solver's submission behavior, suggesting that seekers can benefit the most from a moderate level of ratings in crowdsourcing contests. This study further finds that solvers who receive a large dispersion of ratings are more likely to contribute submissions in a contest. Finally, results show that providing a lower position of first rating is positively related to submission behavior.

To investigate the driving mechanism of the effects of different types of e-government use on trust in government, this research develops a conceptual framework based on the institutional-based trust theory, the process-based trust theory, and the expectancy-disconfirmation model. Based on data collected from 1668 citizen users living in five cities in China, the study verifies the proposed mediated moderation model and then tests the robustness of the results using process analysis. The results reveal that citizens’ use of e-government revitalizes their trust in government indirectly, via influence on citizens’ evaluation of government integrity, performance, and responsiveness from the experience of using e-government, while the mediating effects of citizens’ evaluation of government on relationship between e-government use and public trust are diminished by citizens’ expectations for their government. The analysis also offers strong support for the conclusion that the effects of different types of e-government use on public trust are differentially distributed among multiple levels of governments in China. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Citizens’ expectations; Citizens’ trust in government; e-government use; Government websites; Hierarchical trust in government"

This research therefore explores how and when participative leadership serves as an important antecedent to employees’ cyberloafing. Drawing upon self-concept-based theory, we hypothesize that participative leadership can reduce the cyberloafing of employees with a high need for power by increasing their organization-based self-esteem (OBSE). Analyzing survey data from 212 employee-coworker dyads, we have found that participative leadership is positively related to employees’ OBSE, which, in turn, is negatively related to employees’ cyberloafing. Moreover, employees’ need for power strengthens the relationship between participative leadership and employees’ OBSE as well as the indirect relationship between participative leadership and employees’ cyberloafing through their OBSE. These relationships are significant (versus nonsignificant) when employees’ need for power is high (versus low). Accordingly, this research identifies a novel predictor of employees’ cyberloafing and offers insights for organizational leaders aiming to manage employees’ cyberloafing wisely. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Cyberloafing; Need for power; Organization-based self-esteem; Participative leadership"

Existing studies mainly focus on the detection and the impact of manipulated reviews but are limited in examining the determinants of review legitimacy from the perspective of consumer perception. The current research introduces perceived review manipulation, defined as the extent to which an individual perceives a review as non-authentic with the goal of misleading others and influencing product sales. Using psychological reactance theory as a general framework, we investigate the impact of reviews with deviation from the average ratings on perceived review manipulation and review adoption. We future examine two boundary conditions of the above relationship—the moderating effects of review content concreteness and reviewer rating distribution. We adopt a multi-method approach to the empirical test of the research model. First, three online randomized experiments reveal that: (1) reviews with deviant ratings are more likely to be perceived as manipulated; (2) the relationship in (1) is enhanced when review content is abstract rather than concrete and when a reviewer is usually negative/positive (i.e., his/her rating distribution has positive/negative skewness) based on the deviation direction; and (3) perceived review manipulation negatively influences review adoption. Second, a field study was conducted to support the external validity of our research model.

Smartphones, as the most daily dependent device, have altered and assisted individual shopping decisions in omnichannel retailing. Drawing on the uses and gratifications theory, this research investigates emerging smartphone uses and consumers’ corresponding gratifications in shopping centers. Following a sequential mixed-methods approach, we first conducted semi-structured interviews with forty-three shoppers followed by a targeted survey in the similar fields. The findings allowed us to group nine specific smartphone uses into utilitarian, hedonic and social gratifications; moreover, both utilitarian and hedonic gratifications reduce state anxiety whereas social gratifications do not impact perceived anxiety. Consequently, a reduced level of state anxiety from achieved gratifications will significantly enhance consumer's purchase intentions. We offer insightful theoretical contributions and implications to marketing practitioners. © 2023 The Author(s)","Consumer state anxiety; Shopping centers; Shopping journey; Smartphone uses in-store; Uses and gratifications"

Popular press has linked individuals’ political beliefs and cultural values to the extent to which they believe in false content shared on social networking sites (SNS). However, sweeping generalizations run the risk of helping exacerbate divisiveness in already polarized societies. This study examines the effects of individuals’ political beliefs and espoused cultural values on fake news believability using a repeated-measures design (that exposes individuals to a variety of fake news scenarios). Results from online questionnaire-based survey data collected from participants in the US and India help confirm that conservative individuals tend to exhibit increasing fake news believability and show that collectivists tend to do the same. This study advances knowledge on characteristics that make individuals more susceptible to lending credence to fake news. In addition, this study explores the influence exerted by control variables (i.e., age, sex, and Internet usage). Findings are used to provide implications for theory as well as actionable insights. © 2022 The Author(s)","Espoused cultural values; Fake news believability; Political beliefs; Social media; Social networking sites"

Among those motivating elements, reputation points are the most direct feedback about individuals’ contribution effort, which use numerical units indicating progress. Although some research has found that points can incentivize users to contribute, empirical evidence regarding the influential patterns of such numerical units remains limited. Drawing on numerical cognition literature that an individual's evaluation and judgments may be influenced by certain numerical cues, we particularly focus on the round number bias on knowledge-sharing platforms. Several hypotheses regarding users’ behavioral changes when their accumulated points approach round numbers have been proposed, including their contribution level, contribution quality, and writing style. By analyzing data collected from StackOverflow.com, we find that users perceive round numbers as category boundaries or endpoints and crossing such boundaries can motivate aspirational behaviors. Concretely, users significantly increase their post frequency and length, and write answers with more function words and second-person pronouns. Meanwhile, their posts will be more likely to be accepted as the best answers and gain more votes. We also explore the moderating effects of advanced explicit incentives and numbers’ magnitude. Theoretically, our research contributes to a body of literature on knowledge-sharing platform incentive mechanisms to motivate users’ contributions and sheds light on the utilization of numerical cues to guide individuals’ behaviors in user-generated-content (UGC) provision context. © 2023","Contribution behavior; Incentives; Knowledge-sharing platforms; Round numbers"

Under the endogenous monitoring level, a time-and-materials contract becomes preferable. Although revenue-sharing contract incentivizes more vendor's effort, it also pushes the vendor to inflate the effort, leading to a higher monitoring level.

In recent years, online product sampling has been introduced as a promising promotion instrument for fundraisers. Using a unique dataset of 4,027 campaign-level observations collected from China's highly influential JD Crowdfunding website z.jd.com, this study discusses whether and to what extent a product sampling strategy is beneficial to crowdfunding campaigns. Differences in the strategy's effectiveness across product types are also examined. Empirical results suggest that adopting online product sampling is helpful to crowdfunding performance because it increases the total number of backers, the total fundraising amounts, the average amount of funds raised per backer, the fundraising percentage, and the possibility of campaign success. The strength of product sampling, however, decreases along the search-experience product continuum. © 2022","Experience goods; Fundraising performance; Reward-based Crowdfunding; Search goods; Uncertainty reduction"

We theoretically investigate how a monopolistic digital-good firm may utilize the tool of product demonstration, together with technical and legal antipiracy measures which increase the difficulty or cost of pirating, to optimally manage the impact of piracy on its new product's profitability. We unexpectedly find that, in equilibrium, the firm's profit may strictly decrease with the difficulty of pirating when the true product quality is not especially high, such that the firm chooses not to offer product demonstrations. This is because, with higher piracy costs, the firm has more incentive to offer product demonstrations and, as a result, rational customers’ quality belief conditional on non-demonstration is lower, which leads to a lower profit for the firm. We extend our model to incorporate consumers’ fit uncertainty about the product due to idiosyncratic tastes.

Much research has focused on why, how, or what social content is popular, trending and “hype”. One central challenge is to forecast the spread (cascades) of information that leads to the popularity of content throughout a social network. Online content tends to have bursts and spikes, experiencing a different cascading pattern depending on the viral propagation. In this paper, we propose and test a flexible framework capable of modelling such patterns and trends. We take temporal and network perspectives and develop a model based on the multivariate Hawkes processes that account for social behaviour and network elements such as follower counts, and activity variation observed in collective re-sharing behaviour. We focus on Twitter as the most widely used micro-blogging online social network and measure the popularity of a brand's tweet by analysing the time-series path of three types of subsequent activities (retweets (RTs), replies (REs) and likes (LKs)). The specific model that we propose in this paper is the multidimensional epidemic-type aftershock sequence (METAS) model, a particular case of the multivariate Hawkes process. It consists of a power-law relaxation governing the timing of activities. It also includes an exponential boost as a reinforcement mechanism for the response amplitude to model the impact of influential users on their followers. Earlier attempts to model online cascades have treated all online responses as one type of activity. Rather than aggregating all the activities into one stream, and therefore, ignoring exciting effects among different types of activities, we incorporate the activity variation into the predictive models of content popularity, explicitly accounting for such excitation effects. We develop epidemic-type mutually exciting Hawkes point processes models to quantify such effects and to predict more accurately the number of follow-up activities (i.e., RTs, REs and LKs) on a brand tweet after it is posted. Our results suggest that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of prediction accuracy, as it is able to account for mutual excitations and cross-interactions between sequences of users’ activities from one type to another. These results are relevant for developing and executing a plan for online activities by the brand owners. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Analytics; Brand post popularity; brand post popularity; Brand-generated content; Hawkes process; Online social networks; Social media"

While telemedicine and virtual visits have become popular as a result, they end once a visit is over, hence lacking data persistence and continuity in caring for patients. Using the design science research approach with support from the theory of affordances, this paper proposes the design of a medical system (called wepital) in which patients receive care through their real avatars, enabling hospitals and other medical centers to provide immediate care that can continue for as long as a patient needs it. Real avatars are digital representations of patients that embody their real-time vital signs and health information.

This study adopts a horizontal differentiation model, wherein subscription options are differentiated only in the renewal lengths to make a comparison between the single- and two-option menus. The former offers one option only, whereas the latter offers both the short- and long-length options. Analytical results show that the basic value of the product and the unit misfit cost, which measures consumers’ disutility per unit distance between the actual and ideal subscription lengths, are critical factors in determining the optimal design of the subscription menu. The two-option menu dominates the single-option menu when the basic value and the unit misfit cost exceed certain thresholds. The impact of consumer churn rate on the design of the subscription menu is further examined. The two-option menu is more likely to be the dominant choice as the consumer churn rate increases. Moreover, the effect of the increase in the consumer churn rate on the pricing decision depends on the unit misfit cost. Given a higher consumer churn rate, only if the unit misfit cost is sufficiently low, vendors should improve the price for the short-length option and the price discount level for the long-length option; otherwise, the optimal pricing decision remains unchanged. After endogenizing the length of the long-length option, we discuss how the optimal number of periods of the long-length option varies with the product value, consumers’ cognitive cost, and unit misfit cost. The optimality of the multiple-option menu with more than two options is also explored. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Consumer churn rate; Horizontal differentiation; Price discount; Subscription menu design"

Therefore, it is critical to develop a predictive model capable of identifying areas with high crime intensity and detecting trends of crime occurrence in such areas for the allocation of scarce resources and investment in the prevention and reduction of criminal strategies. This study develops a predictive model based on K-means clustering, signal decomposition technique, and neural networks to identify crime distribution in urban areas and accurately forecast the variation tendency of the number of crimes in each area. We find that the time series of the number of crimes in different areas show a correlation in the long term, but this long-term effect cannot be reflected in the short period. Therefore, we argue that short-term joint law enforcement has no theoretical basis because data show that spatial heterogeneity and time lag cannot be timely reflected in short-term prediction. By combining the temporal and spatial effects, a high-precision anticrime information support system is designed, which can help the police to implement more targeted crime prevention strategies at the micro level. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Crime inference; Machine learning; Public security; Spatial heterogeneity; Time-lag effect"

Modeling and collaborating the key scenario information required for GBDG decision-making can minimize system uncertainties. However, existing scenario-building methods are limited by their rigidity as they are employed in various application contexts and the associated high costs of modeling. In this paper, using a design science paradigm, a model-driven scenario modeling approach is proposed to achieve flexible scenario modeling for various applications through the transfer of generic domain knowledge. The key component of the proposed approach is a scenario meta-model that is built from existing literatures and practices by integrating qualitative, quantitative, and meta-modeling analysis. An instantiation mechanism of the scenario meta-model is also proposed to generate customized scenarios under Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence (ABC) theory. Two real-world safety service cases in Wuhan, China were evaluated to find that the proposed approach reduces GBDG decision-making uncertainties significantly by providing key information for GBDG problem identification, solution design, and solution value perception.

To benefit from the advantages HIT offer, users must first accept them. This meta-analysis synthesizes previous research on HIT acceptance. It uses data from 214 independent samples reported in 193 articles and 83,619 technology users from 33 countries. The study contributes to the HIT literature by (1) synthesizing the empirical findings on technology acceptance factors and combining them in a comprehensive model, (2) testing the mediating mechanisms of health technology acceptance, and (3) examining contextual differences. The study finds that HIT acceptance depends on various predictors proposed by the technology acceptance model and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology. These factors displayed strong indirect effects through effort expectancy, perceptions of the technology, performance expectancy, and attitudes toward using HIT. Studies overlooking these effects may underestimate the importance of various acceptance factors. Finally, the results suggest that technology acceptance varies across healthcare technologies (remote information systems [IS], wearables), users (staff/patients, age, voluntariness, experience), and locations (hospitals, healthcare systems, life expectancy in country). We also provide IS managers with guidance for improving technology acceptance in the healthcare industry to ensure efficient, high-quality services. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Healthcare technologies; Meta-analysis; Technology acceptance"

These news articles, available in unprecedent frequency and quantity, are difficult to sift through manually. Most of existing techniques for NED are full-text-based; typically, they perform full-text analysis to measure the similarity between a new article and previous articles. This full-text-based approach is potentially ineffective, because a news article often contains sentences that are less relevant to define the focal event being reported and the inclusion of these less relevant sentences into the similarity estimation can impair the effectiveness of NED. To address the limitation of the full-text-based approach and support NED more effectively and efficiently, this study proposes and develops a summary-based event detection method that first selects relevant sentences of each article as a summary, then uses the resulting summaries to detect new events. We empirically evaluate our proposed method in comparison with some prevalent full-text-based techniques, including a vector space model and two deep-learning-based models.

We collected and examined the flight reviews on TripAdvisor from January 2016 to August 2020 to gauge the impact of COVID-19 on passenger travel sentiment in several aspects. Till now, information systems, management, and tourism research have paid little attention to the use of deep learning and word embedding techniques, such as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, especially for aspect-level sentiment analysis. This paper aims to identify perceived aspect-based sentiments and predict unrated sentiments for various categories to address this research gap. Ultimately, this study complements existing sentiment analysis methods and extends the use of data-driven and visual analytics approaches to better understand customer satisfaction in the airline industry and within the context of the COVID-19. Our proposed method outperforms baseline comparisons and therefore contributes to the theoretical and managerial literature. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis; Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers; Deep Learning; Information Visualization; Natural Language Processing; Social Media Analysis"

This behavior is exacerbated by the availability, affordability, and usability of modern technological devices like smart mobile phones, wearables, the rapid proliferation of social media and communication apps, and the intensification of digitized business and/or personal interactions. As a result, there is an increased propensity to acquire and accumulate substantial amounts of digital content. Employing the theoretical foundations of the attachment theory and the hoarding disorder, this study argues that the characteristics such as difficulty of discarding digital content, digital clutter, and frequent excessive acquisition of digital content demonstrate the signs of digital hoarding. By conducting a survey using 846 respondents and conducting a multigroup analysis, this study provides confirmatory evidence on digital hoarding and its association to anxiety. As such, this study contributes to the dark side of technology use and introduces a new concept called digital hoarding to information systems research. © 2022","Anxiety; Attachment theory; Dark side of technology use; Digital hoarding; Hoarding disorder; Multi-group analysis; Survey"

Professionally oriented social network sites (P-SNSs), such as LinkedIn, have been under-researched in the information systems discipline. Additionally, little is known about the effects of important elements of SNSs (such as one's profile) on social capital formation. As such, the main objective of this research is to propose and validate a model that explains the process by which individuals develop and accrue social capital through P-SNS use. This model draws upon social capital theory and social network analysis and is validated through a survey of 377 LinkedIn users. Our results find that (1) P-SNS users’ actions (perceived profile disclosure, active participation, and passive consumption) have significant positive effects on perceived social connectedness; (2) perceived social connectedness on P-SNSs has a significant positive effect on perceived networking value on these sites; (3) perceived profile disclosure and passive consumption have significant positive effects on network size; (4) active participation does not have any effect on network size, and (5) network size does not have a significant effect on perceived networking value. Overall, this investigation advances our understanding of how social capital is formed in P-SNSs. Additionally, this is the first study in the P-SNS context that investigates the role of the user profile in the social capital formation process, along with user actions of active participation and passive consumption. From a practical perspective, this study has implications for different audiences, such as job seekers, recruiters, and P-SNS providers, assisting them in playing a more effective role in the social capital formation process on P-SNSs. © 2022","LinkedIn; Networking value; Social capital; Social network analysis; Social network sites"

We propose a data-driven approach by combining descriptive statistics, topic modeling, and regression analysis based on large-scale job posting data collected from a nationwide Chinese recruitment website. By this approach, we provide an overall picture of the landscape of the recruitment market for blockchain-related jobs and identify 11 skill sets that are most in-demand for blockchain-related jobs. On this basis, the skill sets of Blockchain Development and Cryptocurrency have emerged to be the most valued ones that affect salary levels: the talents mastering these two skill sets can obtain 21.4%, 10.4% higher average salaries, respectively, than those without these skills.

Drawing on self-enhancement theory, we test hypotheses concerning exhibitionistic motivation in photo posting using a novel dataset of group tourism products. An instrumental variable method is used to address the endogeneity issue. We find that the distance between departure and destination, an indicator of cost and time spent, has a positive effect on the inclination to share photos. But people of higher status refrain from the conspicuous display of their photos. Moreover, the distance effect on photo sharing is mitigated by status within a website, suggesting that people assign different marginal values to the conspicuous display of tourism products at the same distance.

Governments and businesses play important roles in fostering public acceptance of eco-friendly products and in increasing people's use of resource recycling to achieve sustainable development. The present study, thus, explores how a website's gamification mechanics influence the intrinsic motivations and needs satisfaction of users as well as their engagement in resource recycling. In addition, it investigates how environmental concerns moderate the relationships between intrinsic motivations and user engagement. The results reveal that gamification helps foster user engagement in resource recycling by influencing needs satisfaction (i.e., relatedness, competence, and autonomy) between gamification mechanics and intrinsic motivations (i.e., self-presentation, self-efficacy, and flow). For users with high vs. low environmental concerns, intrinsic motivations have a more significant effect on their engagement in resource recycling. It is found that gamification not only creates intrinsic motivation, but it is also likely to facilitate the satisfaction of psychological needs through mechanisms such as self-expression, point rewards, and competition.

This study performs linguistic profiling on OHC participants based on a large dataset and empirically evaluates how lexical, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic features affect users' communication and social support outcomes. The results show that lexical richness in health-related vocabulary negatively correlates with receiving informational support. The readability and brevity of written texts have positive relationships with incoming social support. Writing longer sentences positively correlates with receiving informational support but negatively correlates with receiving emotional support. Expressing negative sentiment leads to higher chances of receiving both types of social support. The use of terms related to perception and body parts increases the chances of receiving emotional support. The use of terms related to perception words additionally correlates to higher chances of receiving informational support. To receive social supports, being logical in expressions is also critical.

However, existing approaches face difficulties analyzing consumer preferences over different attributes of alternatives (restaurants, hotels, etc.), which hinders product/service providers from comprehensively understanding consumer choice decisions. To address this issue, we solve for the consumer preferences over the attributes represented by attribute weights based on consumers’ historical data, including text comments and overall ratings. Specifically, for each comment and a corresponding rating, we first employ sentiment analysis to calculate values of the attributes, and then develop a quadratic programming model to solve for the weights. Based on a stream of a consumer's text comments and overall ratings, we can correspondingly obtain a stream of weights indexed by the comment time. We then model this stream of weights as hesitant judgments and employ a hesitant multiplicative programming method to solve for the final weights that fit the consumer's preferences over attributes at the highest satisficing level. In the application of recommendation, our approach not only provides insights into the consumer's preferences but also has higher prediction power compared with some state-of-the-art methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Consumer preference; Decision analysis; Hesitant judgment; Pairwise comparisons; Recommendation; Sentiment analysis"

Innovative sociotechnical design artifacts involve digital information technologies (IT) being used in ways that result in profound disruptions to traditional ways of doing business and to widespread societal changes. The pervasiveness of DI means that the individuals involved in bringing it about have diverse backgrounds, including application specialists, software engineers, data scientists, business managers, economists, venture capitalists, various user groups, and entrepreneurial leaders. This range of backgrounds means that DI, much more than traditional innovation, leads to varied perspectives on the methods and tools to be used in the development of effective and evolvable complex systems incorporating digital innovations. In this paper we present a new matrix approach to DI based on DSR, entrepreneurship, and innovation theories. Clear strategic guidance allows these multiple stakeholders to make sense of the diverse landscape and to understand when and how different entrepreneurial strategies for innovation can best be applied. We define the combined DSR and DI matrix approach in terms of four strategies: invention; advancement; exaptation; and exploitation and their associated DI practices. The research contribution is a novel DSR-DI matrix process model. This model extends entrepreneurship theory as it enriches effectuation thinking with more detailed process guidance for ambidextrous entrepreneurship and it enriches DSR models for DI by showing more explicitly the different pathways corresponding to different quadrants in the knowledge-innovation matrix. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Design science research; Digital innovation; Entrepreneurship; Entrepreneurship strategies; Information technology; Knowledge; Sociotechnical systems"

Using a structural topic modelling analysis consisting of an unsupervised machine learning procedure, we find that Italian municipalities mostly post on five semantically different topics on their Facebook pages. More importantly, each topic's prevalence is positively associated with the most related municipal expenses per capita by function. Furthermore, additional covariates significantly influence each topic's prevalence. Within the framework of legitimacy theory, these results indicate the strategic usage of Facebook by Italian municipalities for self-promotion and political marketing aimed at enhancing their political legitimacy and consensus among citizens.

For the sharing of health records, little is known about the application of blockchain in management information systems. There are strict regulations for sharing health information due to insecure systems and privacy concerns. To significantly and effectively improve medical diagnosis, it is beneficial to have efficient, reliable, and accurate accessibility to a patient's full medical history. Due to concerns with the security of health systems and privacy concerns, medical histories are not always accessible to healthcare providers. To help increase accessibility options, this research proposes a blockchain-based model that facilitates sharing medical records in a manner that is beneficial to both healthcare providers and patients. Social exchange theory provides the theoretical support for the conceptual model presented. Experimental findings based on 151 participants revealed that the blockchain technology can provide a secure information system and increase patient motivation to share medical records. To show the applicability of the proposed use of blockchain from a practical managerial perspective, we show feasibility by developing an Android software application. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain; Health Management Information Systems; Motivation; Security Perception; Social Exchange Theory"

This paper compares social media with mass media in the stock market, focusing on information coverage diversity and predictive value with respect to future stock absolute returns. Based on a study of nearly a million stock-related news articles from the Sina Finance news platform and 12.7 million stock-related social media messages from the popular Weibo platform in China, we find that social media covers less stocks than mass media, and this effect is amplified as the volume of media information increases. We find that there is some short-term predictive value from these sources, but they are different. Although mass media information coverage is more predictive than social media information coverage in a one-day horizon, it is the other way around in a two-to five-day horizon. These empirical results suggest that social media and mass media serve stock market investors differently. We draw connections to theories related to how crowds and experts differ and offer practical implications for the design of media-related IS systems. © 2021","Future stock absolute return; Information coverage diversity; Mass media; Predictive value; Social media"

Yet our knowledge of the emancipatory potential of digital entrepreneurship remains limited because few studies have gone beyond the conventional emphasis on profits and wealth creation. Drawing on the emancipatory perspective that views entrepreneurship as change creation through the removal of constraints, this article examines how emancipation can occur through the actions of digital entrepreneurs. Using an empirical investigation of entrepreneurial endeavours set against disadvantaged communities in Indonesia, we uncover constraints facing a developing economy and the role of digital technologies in ameliorating them. Through extensive fieldwork and in-depth case study analyses, we identify constraining societal norms and restrictive practices, as well as the three forms of digital enablement - to emulate services, aggregate capital and equalise opportunities – necessary for the enactment of digitally enabled emancipation.

The consumption boosted by piracy can promote Internet buzz, which may draw the attention of potential consumers and may result in broader legal consumption afterward. Based on an empirical analysis regarding the relationships among the viewership of 20 TV dramas broadcast in the US, social media activities on Twitter, Google and YouTube search trends, and the number of BitTorrent users who pirated these TV dramas, we show that although the direct effect of media consumption through BitTorrent to TV viewership is negative, the indirect effect that mediates Internet buzz is positive, which dilutes the negative effect of digital piracy.

However, whether sustainable consumption prompts more social value-oriented behaviors outside the consumption domain remains uncertain. The increased availability of consumer-level big data presents an opportunity to investigate consumers’ cross-domain behavior subsequent to sustainable consumption, which broadens the comprehension of sustainable consumption by going beyond the boundary of consumption behavior. Supported by a joint dataset comprising information on both consumers’ consumption behavior and their microloan repayment behavior, this study examines the effects of sustainable consumption on consumers’ subsequent debt default behavior to empirically test the cross-domain spillover effects of sustainable consumption behavior. The results suggest that the default probability of green consumers overall was 4.34 % lower than that of nongreen consumers, even though this positive effect on repayment disappears when sustainable consumption is for health reasons.

However, there is little understanding of the role of conscious motivations and, more importantly, their interplay with subconscious motivations in their decisions. Using the value appreciation perspective, we controlled for the predictors of the second version of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) and leverage prospect theory to enrich our understanding of users’ continuance intentions. We conceptualize status quo preference with two new constructs—namely, the value of status quo and users’ commitment to status quo—and integrate them with other known predictors of continuance intentions (related to an incumbent system)—i.e., trust and habit.

Study 2 reports longitudinal data, across three waves of data collection over a period of six months, from 240 analysts introduced to a new technology to support their work in a large financial services organization. The findings support our model and suggest that (1) users’ status quo preferences significantly determine continuance intentions; and (2) trust and habit have an effect on users’ status quo preferences.

Hospitals contracting with Medicare, for instance, are reimbursed for the procedures performed, regardless of the number of days that patients stay in the hospital. This reimbursement structure has incentivized hospitals to use their resources (such as their beds) more efficiently to maximize revenues. One way hospitals can improve bed utilization is by predicting patients’ length of stay (LOS) at the time of admission, the benefits of which extend to employees, communities, and the patients themselves. In this paper, we employ a data analytics approach to develop and test a deep learning neural network to predict LOS for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia. The theoretical contribution of our effort is that it identifies variables related to patients’ prior admissions as important factors in the prediction of LOS in hospitals, thereby revising the current paradigm in which patients’ medical histories are rarely considered for the prediction of LOS. The methodological contributions of our work include the development of a data engineering methodology to augment the data sets, prediction of LOS as a numerical (rather than a binary) variable, temporal evaluation of the training and validation data sets, and a significant improvement in the accuracy of predicting LOS for COPD and pneumonia inpatients. Our evaluations show that variables related to patients’ previous admissions are the main driver of the deep network's superior performance in predicting the LOS as a numerical variable. Using the assessment criteria introduced in prior studies (i.e., ±2 days and ±3 days tolerance), our models are able to predict the length of hospital stay with 86 % and 91 % accuracy for the COPD data set, and with 74 % and 85 % accuracy for the pneumonia data set. Hence, our effort could help hospitals serve a larger number of patients with a fixed amount of resources, thereby reducing their environmental footprint while increasing their revenue, as well as their patients’ satisfaction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Data analytics; Deep learning; Length of hospital stay; Sustainability; Temporal evaluation"

We participated as members responsible for standards on information security and our analysis revealed two structures: consensus and warfare. A major implication of the combination of these structures is that legitimacy claims based on appeals to best practice are futile because it is difficult to know which the best practice is. © 2022 The Author(s)","ethnography; information security; legitimacy; Standard development; structuration theory"

We specially examine the role of review certainty on review usefulness. Drawing on dual-process and social influence theories, we examine the interaction effects of review certainty, reviewer popularity, reviewer expertise, and the niche width of a restaurant on review usefulness. In particular, this study focuses on how review certainty interacts with other contextual factors to influence users’ evaluation of the usefulness of online reviews. Utilizing a zero-inflated negative binomial Poisson regression, we empirically tested our hypotheses based on 10,097 reviews on 2,383 restaurants from Yelp.com. Our results indicated that (1) the impact of review certainty on review usefulness decreases with reviewer popularity but does not vary with reviewer expertise and (2) the niche width of a restaurant—as a contextual feature—interacts with review certainty and reviewer characteristics in influencing review usefulness. Theoretically, these findings contribute to online customer review literature and certainty literature, as well as social media research, provide new guidelines for predicting review usefulness, and add new insights into understanding the role of organizational positioning for customer evaluations. In practice, our findings can help online review platforms better understand how to screen and select useful reviews for visitors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Review certainty; Review usefulness; Reviewer expertise; Reviewer popularity; Social media analytics"

This study proposes a conceptual model to examine the role of SPD on people's responses to native advertising, i.e., advertising acceptance (AC) and advertising engagement (AE), in social media. The model was validated using survey data collected from a large social community. The results indicate that SPD is a crucial determinant of native advertising responses. Moreover, AC partially mediates the relationship between SPD and AE.

We find a nonlinear relationship between the STR regulation and the LTR rental prices through analyzing a constructed panel of monthly LTR and STR data from 15 cities across the United States. The nonlinear relationship between these two indicates that STR regulations only have a short-term impact on the LTR market prices but they cannot effectively contain the negative impacts of STR on the LTR market in the long run.

Theories like the technology acceptance model, user satisfaction, service quality, the diffusion of innovations theory, and others identify a wide variety of influential beliefs, such as those that target properties of the system itself (e.g., its features), the use of it (e.g., its ease of use), or other contextual aspects (e.g., the pressure from peers to use it). These theories have been invaluable for understanding one of the most fundamental phenomena of interest to IS researchers and practitioners: individuals’ adoption and use of information technology (IT). However, as valuable as these theories are, there has been growing criticism about the fact that several of their constituting belief constructs (e.g., usefulness or quality) do not lend themselves to prescriptions for actionable interventions, in particular those geared toward IT design. This is especially problematic when it comes to applying or extending them to the contexts of emerging technologies, where best design practices are still to be discovered and tested. We address this concern by developing a Broadness Reduction Methodology (BRM) that relies on Fishbein and Ajzen's (1975) foundational work on the nature and formation of beliefs to help researchers develop belief-based theoretical models that are more relevant to IT practitioners. In order to illustrate the application of our methodology and demonstrate its validity, we apply it to the context of e-business. In doing so, we decompose the broad construct of supporting-service functionality, which has been shown to be a strong predictor of satisfaction and continued usage, into more specific constructs that are more amenable to actionable design recommendations. © 2021","Beliefs; Broadness; Inference; IT usage; Practical relevance; Specificity"

Before responding, the company should consider the potential impacts due to the different reactions of stakeholders. A company's ideal choice of strategy during a social media storm depends on the costs of that strategy for the company and the likelihood that netizens will publicly condemn the company on social media. In this study, we employ a model based on evolutionary game theory to investigate crisis communication on social media. The results show that the company's choice of response strategy influences the evolution of the strategy pursued by Internet users. In the base model, we consider three possible actions for netizens on social media in reaction to an incident: ignoring the incident, noticing the incident but staying silent, and condemning the company and transmitting negative information. Subsequently, we extend the base model to consider complex network structures and defensive behavior. We also studied real-world cases of social media crisis communication and conducted numeric simulations with different parameters in order to determine the evolutionary equilibrium in different situations, which may inform the crisis response strategy selected by companies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Crisis communication response strategy; Evolutionary game theory; Social media crisis communication"

In this study, a novel method-Identifying Comparable entities from online Question-Answering contents (ICQA)-is proposed to effectively extract comparable entities from online Q&A communities. In ICQA, candidate entities are firstly extracted by utilizing the advantages of pattern-based methods and supervised learning-based methods. An entity comparison network is then built by considering the credibility difference and entity relatedness in Q&A contents to analyze competitiveness between entities and extract comparable entities from candidate entities accordingly. Thus, within the same method framework, comparable entities and their competitiveness ranks can be simultaneously identified for a given entity specified by managers or consumers. By taking the automotive industry as the experimental background, the effectiveness of ICQA is demonstrated with comprehensive experiments regarding comparable entity identification and comparable entity ranking. Experimental results demonstrate that compared with state-of-the-art methods, ICQA can identify more accurate and broader comparable entities, find novel entities ignored by other methods, and provide a more solid comparable entity rank-features that are deemed desirable and applicable for both managers and consumers in making rational decisions based on online Q&A contents. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Comparable entity identification; Comparison network; Entity ranking; Question-answering contents"

By endowing community members with new roles, the decentralization of blockchain-based communities brings changes to the design of user incentive mechanisms. However, few studies have paid attention to the user incentive mechanism when users play the dual roles of social participant and community owner. On the basis of social capital theory and psychological ownership theory, this study explores Steemit's incentive mechanism by evaluating the impact of these dual roles on user active participation behavior. The study adopts a two-way fixed effect negative binomial regression to test the research model. The results show that users’ social capital, share capital, social feedback, and economic feedback positively affect their active participation behavior. At the same time, social feedback and economic feedback play moderating roles on the effects of the dual capitals. Overall, this research provides both theoretical insights and practical implications for understanding, designing, and governing blockchain-based online communities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain-based online community; Decentralized autonomous organization; Psychological Ownership; Social Capital"

The aim of this research is to explore how different inertial forces during deployments of big data analytics hinder the emergence of dynamic capabilities. To do so, we follow a multiple-case study design approach of 27 European firms and examine the different forms of inertia that materialize during big data analytics diffusion. The findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge on how big data analytics can be leveraged effectively to enable and strengthen a firm's dynamic capabilities. By disaggregating dynamic capabilities into the underlying capabilities of sensing, seizing and transforming, findings indicate that different combinations of organizational inertia including economic, political, socio-cognitive, negative psychology, and socio-technical hamper the formation of each type of capability. © 2020 The Author(s)","Big data analytics; Deployment; Inertia; IT-enabled transformation; Multiple case study; Organizational transformation"

A questionnaire survey is conducted to analyze the effect of factors including technical capacity, organizational awareness, organizational arrangement, and rules and regulations on OGD implementation. Results show that the technical capacity, organizational arrangement, and rules and regulations of government agencies have a direct positive effect on OGD implementation.

Our key findings are: 1) the own-price elasticity of demand is higher offline (i.e., –1.74 on average) than online (i.e., –0.87 on average). 2) The cross-price elasticity is also higher offline (i.e., 0.17 on average) than online (i.e., 0.04 on average). 3) When a product is out-of-stock, a larger portion of the loss of the market share is recovered more in the common products in the offline markets than that in the online markets. Specifically, 6.55 % of the loss of the market share goes to common products offline on average, while 6.05 % of the loss of the market share goes to the common product online on average. Our further analyses show that, when considering substitute products, the impact of price increases is surprising. The retailer may not be worse off by increasing prices because the gains in the revenue from the substitute products can make up more than the losses. The manufacturers may lose revenue by increasing prices or product stockouts.

In the proposed model, consumers are differentiated not only by their preferences for privacy but also by search costs. For simplicity, stores in the proposed model differ in terms of the price charged and the privacy protection level offered. As derived from the theoretical model and empirical validation, better privacy protection does not necessarily lead to the highest price, though it does allow stores to charge a premium price.

We assert that, while higher board IT competence has positive implications in IT value-creation, it could have a negative implication in the IT value-protection context. When firms have a more IT competent board, equity investors’ ex-ante expectations of superior oversight of IT by the board are baked into those firms’ equity prices. When such firms experience operational IT failures, investors would view their boards as relatively ineffective in IT oversight and adjust more sharply the ex-ante expectations built into equity prices. Using agency-theoretic arguments, we develop this reasoning into a hypothesis that board IT competence is negatively associated with firm market performance post operational IT failures.

Globally, four core technologies have been ranked high for most of the countries: networks/telecommunications, business intelligence/analytics, enterprise application integration, and mobile and wireless applications. There were also differences among countries. Statistical analyses were performed to analyze the nature of these differences based on the economic level of the country and its IT infrastructure capability. Further insights were generated by performing cluster analysis; grouping the countries into three clusters (optimizers, pragmatists, and progressives), and examining their characteristics and technology priorities. These results are useful for multinational companies, governments, and international agencies as they forge their technology strategies and make investment decisions. We also lay the foundation for ongoing research to better understand the contextual factors that explain the differences in technology priorities among nations. © 2021","Cluster analysis; Global IT landscape; Information technology priorities; IT infrastructure capability; Key IT issues"

Based on neoinstitutional theory and a multi-study field survey of 834 professional managers in the USA, we develop and test a model that explains the establishment of ISKS practices in an organization as a product of the institutional forces abut to the organization providing normative, mimetic, and coercive influences on top management beliefs and participations in ISKS.

Building on Social Exchange theory, we suggest that interactions between users and RAs are driven by the concepts of perceived interdependence and reciprocity. We suggest that perceived user effort decreases the perceived RA quality, whereas RA effort increases the perceived RA quality. We conducted two experimental studies across different contexts. We found that users evaluate RAs based on their own expended effort, in relation to how much effort they perceived the RA has put into the process of generating recommendations.

Now end users can build large applications by assembling a suite of services. Because some end users might have limited knowledge of their requirements and the functionality of available services, the key challenge is to find the services needed to build an application. The task of finding the services matching requirements requires specialized knowledge—knowledge of requirements and the functionality of available services—not just mere general competence. Moreover, the complexity of the requirements could also hinder the ability of end users to select services. However, there is little research into how the end users’ sophistication and requirement complexity affect their ability to avoid duplication (i.e., select the most cost-effective set of services) and select a set of services that satisfy their requirements. We provide a conceptual framework for the choice problem faced by the decision maker and develop a set of hypotheses on end user's sophistication and requirement complexity, and the impact of these factors on outcome performance—the ability to avoid duplication and select the appropriate services. Then we conduct an empirical study to test the hypotheses. Empirical results offer support for all hypotheses. Our work has several implications. We demonstrate both conceptually and empirically that end users’ naivety has a significant impact on service duplication.

Design/methodology/approach: To test the model developed, we conducted an online questionnaire survey with Malaysian manufacturing companies drawn from the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers directory of 2018. Out of the 400 questionnaires sent out to the manufacturing companies, 144 useable responses were received giving a response rate of 36 %. The data were analyzed using SmartPLS, a second-generation statistical tool. Findings: The findings of this study showed that information quality, information security, and information technology (IT) had a positive effect on SCII with an explanatory power of 47.2 % while SCII, in turn, had a positive effect on operational performance explaining 17% of the variance. Intentional information leakage (IIL) moderated the relationship between SCII and operational performance, whereas accidental information leakage did not moderate the same relationship. Practical implications: This study provides insights into difficulties faced when implementing SCII, particularly by medium and large manufacturing companies in Malaysia. It helps identify appropriate strategies that can guide the management in its effort to improve performance by SCII. Originality/value: This research is arguably the first study that simultaneously investigates the effect of information quality, IT, and information security on SCII and the moderating effect of information leakage on the relationships between SCII and operational performance. The results of this study indicate that information security has the largest impact on SCII, followed by IT, and information quality. Furthermore, IIL as a negative aspect of information integration may deprive the strength of the relationship between SCII and operational performance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Information leakage; Information sharing; Malaysia; Manufacturing firms; Operational performance; Supply chain information integration"

However, with the advent of digital technologies, a new kind of product innovations gained importance: digital product and service innovations (DPI). As a consequence of their idiosyncratic characteristics, the usefulness and validity of existing product innovation management concepts cannot be transferred to the context of DPI without further ado. Accordingly, this study reinvestigates the role of IT-C in the specific context of DPI. Therefore, we begin with a differentiation of DPI from traditional, non-digital product innovation. Then, we propose that IT-C affect the performance of DPI projects via two paths. First, based on the notion that DPI rely on the use of innovative IT, we assume that IT-C directly impact DPI performance. Second, following prior research that has argued that the performance contribution of IT-C is mediated by other organizational intermediaries, we assume that IT-C also indirectly contribute to DPI performance through their positive influence on other organizational capabilities. One such organizational capability that mediates the influence of IT-C on DPI performance is a firm's DPI capabilities (DPI-C). DPI-C allow firms to deploy their digital resources for DPI purposes and, thus, are an important antecedent for DPI performance. To test our assumptions, we use partial least squares–structural equation modeling technique and analyze survey data collected from DPI projects across different industries in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Digital capabilities; Digital innovations; Digital products and services; Digital transformation; IT business value; IT capabilities; New product development; Resource-based view"

The concerns over the disruptive nature of such home-sharing platforms, particularly on the traditional industries and the neighborhood in which the lodgings are provided, have resulted in lawmakers imposing or considering to impose short-term rental (STR) regulations. This research, which anchors on the public interest theory and the prospect theory, examines the overall effect of STR regulation and identifies effective individual regulatory passages on the supply side of P2P home-sharing platforms. Our subsequent empirical analysis results suggest that the regulatory intervention is less likely to restrain the growth of the home-sharing economy in the long-run even though there is a short-term deterrent effect of STR regulation on new entrants to the market. Different regulatory passages exert varying effects on the new entrants and the exit of the incumbent hosts. In specific, three regulatory passages, namely, cap, standards, and eviction restrictions, have a parsimonious effect on containing both the new listing and the delisting.

Unique corroboration entropy is calculated based on the number of words in this review that describe the product on the seller's site, confirming the seller's claims, which did not appear in previous reviews. Recommendation entropy is based on the number of words that are associated with explicit recommendations. Unique opinion, referred as “regular opinions” in the literature, entropy is based on the number of all the other words in the review that provide positive or negative evaluations of products as well as other additional informational elements that did not appear in previous reviews.

Previous studies of user behavior in a free trial of ITS have mainly focused on either the adoption intention in the pre-trial stage or purchase intention in the post-trial stage. There is a lack of study investigating the trial stage that facilitates the transition and connection between these two separately studied stages. In this study, we view free trial as a motivated learning process and propose a Three-Stage Model (TSM) based on the learning motivation theory and reference-dependent theory to investigate users’ free trial behavior dynamics in moving from motivation to trial, making efforts to gain trial experience, and finally making a further purchase decision after the trial. We collected 377 users’ free trial experience to test our TSM using partial least squares-based structural equation modeling. Our results indicate that the perceived trial benefit and social influence strongly motivate user's willingness to trial and that the utility experience and flow experience gained through trial effort leads to a willingness to accept and ultimately affect user's willingness to pay through the mediation effect of expected additional value and price justification.

Accordingly, we designed and conducted a set of controlled survey experiments with 317 participants in different MSN interface scenarios by manipulating the types of MSN interfaces (i.e., high vs. low disruption), the context (hedonic vs. utilitarian scenarios), and the degree of MSN intrusiveness (high vs. low intrusiveness). We found that both app interface usability and the design of MSNs significantly impacted users’ perceived security, which, in turn, has a positive influence on users’ intention to continue using the app. In addition, we identified an important conundrum: disruptive MSNs—a common approach to delivering MSNs—irritate users and negatively influence their perceptions of app security.

For instance, click-through intention requires observing a “like” from a close person, while view-through intentions can also develop after observing “likes” from less close acquaintances, yet in the last case only if the user assumes the acquaintance is better informed regarding the sponsored content. In addition, a “like” from a close friend deemed better informed can even make a user click on a sponsored content that was not considered valuable before. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Click-through; Fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA); Herd behavior; Social media advertising; Social networking sites; Strengths of ties; View-through"

Considering that consumers may doubt the disclosed information, these platforms may have the incentive to implement blockchain technology to authenticate their disclosed information and, therefore, eliminate consumer distrust. In this paper, we develop an analytical model to investigate the optimal information disclosure and equilibrium blockchain adoption strategy for competing platforms and analyse how the consumers’ beliefs and blockchain cost will affect the equilibrium results. Our results show that the equilibrium blockchain adoption strategy is a threshold-structured policy. To be specific, there are two critical values of blockchain cost. If the blockchain cost is larger than the upper threshold, then neither of the platforms has the incentive to apply blockchain technology, and the market is full of unverified information; however, if the blockchain cost is less than the lower threshold, both platforms prefer to apply blockchain technology, and the amount of authenticated information is larger than that of unverified information in the nonblockchain case. Finally, if the blockchain cost is between the two bounds, then a mixed strategy becomes the equilibrium; that is, one platform adopts the blockchain technology, while the other does not. In this case, the amount of authenticated information may be larger than that of unverified information, but the platform that ignores using blockchains is also better off with this new technology. We make several extensions, and the results show that our main conclusions remain unchanged, which indicates that the conclusions can be generalized. © 2021","Blockchain technology; Competition; Information disclosure; Platforms"

We propose two information theory-based constructs derived from probabilistic topic models and show their relationship with review helpfulness.

The second construct, content deviation, indicates the deviance of the review content in comparison with others and exerts a normative influence on readers’ voting behavior. Noting the possibility that a review can get voted but has zero helpfulness score, we use a double-hurdle model to simultaneously estimate the probability of a review being voted and its helpfulness. The analyses on three product categories show that reviews with more depth and less content deviation are rated more helpful. Further, the relationships are moderated by a number of factors, including the deviation of numerical rating, recency of the review, and the reputation of the reviewer.

This has triggered large-scale adoption across hospitals. However, whether all hospitals obtain a similar effect from their EHR implementations remains an important question because there are significant differences differences in characteristics of hospitals adopting these systems. To examine differences in effects across hospitals, we examine whether the impacts of EHR applications are contingent on work domains, by assessing performance effects across hospitals with varying administrative scale and clinical complexity. Because EHRs constitute a suite of applications with different functionalities, examining the effects of different sets of applications is challenging due to nonlinear interdependencies between applications. Therefore, we use an archetype approach, identifying synergistic EHR (EHRSYN) archetype as an ideal portfolio—a conceptual anchor for a hospital's EHR portfolio. We test contingencies by combining this technology archetype with the work domains—administrative scale and clinical complexity. We test our hypotheses using empirical data from 137 hospitals in California, hypothesizing the differences in effects of EHRs on financial, operational, and clinical performances across hospitals with different administrative scales (size) and clinical complexities (case-mix) of work. While hospitals gain the most by implementing a portfolio close to the EHRSYN archetype, our nuanced models reveal that the benefits of such portfolios increase for large hospitals and are greater for hospitals treating less complex cases. These findings underscore how variations in applications used and work domains demarcate boundaries related to the performance effects of EHRs.

By setting up a new online store on a well-known Chinese e-commerce platform, we conducted a field experiment with 182 participants to test our research model. The results provided strong evidence that both LQS and LTS increased a consumer's perceived arousal, which then led to impulse purchase. Furthermore, there was an interaction effect between the two types of scarcity strategies on perceived arousal. Finally, although personal impulsiveness positively affected a consumer's impulse purchase, it did not moderate the influence of perceived arousal on impulse purchase. Our findings provide both theoretical implications and design guidelines on triumphant employment of scarcity promotion strategies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Limited-Quantity scarcity; Limited-Time scarcity; Online impulse purchase; Perceived arousal; Personal impulsiveness"

Nevertheless, while researchers and practitioners started to examine the shifts that these technologies entail and their overall business value, it is still unclear whether and under what conditions they drive innovation. To address this gap, this study draws on the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm and information governance theory to explore the interplay between a firm's big data analytics capabilities (BDACs) and their information governance practices in shaping innovation capabilities. We argue that a firm's BDAC helps enhance two distinct types of innovative capabilities, incremental and radical capabilities, and that information governance positively moderates this relationship. To examine our research model, we analyzed survey data collected from 175 IT and business managers. Results from partial least squares structural equation modelling analysis reveal that BDACs have a positive and significant effect on both incremental and radical innovative capabilities. Our analysis also highlights the important role of information governance, as it positively moderates the relationship between BDAC's and a firm's radical innovative capability, while there is a nonsignificant moderating effect for incremental innovation capabilities. Finally, we examine the effect of environmental uncertainty conditions in our model and find that information governance and BDACs have amplified effects under conditions of high environmental dynamism. © 2020 The Author(s)","Big data analytics capabilities; Environmental uncertainty; FIMIX-PLS; Incremental innovation; Information governance; Radical innovation"

Users interpret relevant cues from the information and respond to it through engagement behavior such as online word of mouth through social media. Drawing on the information processing theory, this study develops a model of how user engagement behavior mediates the relationship between a firm's actions and performance. The theoretical model is tested in two empirical studies. One uses actions of six representative Internet service firms and their users’ online word-of-mouth behavior over a 50-month period. The second is a two-stage controlled laboratory experiment designed to establish causal linkages between firm actions and user engagement. The study provides support for its hypotheses and offers several key findings. First, the firm's actions influence user engagement behavior. Specifically, when a firm launches a larger number of actions, users are engaged in a higher volume of activities and deeper activities. When a firm employs actions that are simpler and easier to understand, users are engaged in deeper activities but not necessarily a larger volume of activities. Second, user engagement is a missing link between a firm's actions and performance. Specifically, engagement depth positively mediates the effects of both action volume and action simplicity on performance. By contrast, engagement breadth positively mediates the effect of action volume but not the effect of action simplicity on performance. Collectively, the study contributes to a clearer understanding of the role of users in firms’ actions and provides key insights regarding how firms benefit from user engagement. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Firm action; Firm performance; Information processing; Mediating effect; User engagement"

An important decision for firms to make in adopting a cloud computing model is whether to build it in-house (a private cloud) or outsource it (a public cloud). Prior literature has focused on the impact of firms’ characteristics but generated inconsistent results regarding the selection of cloud computing models. To add to this line of inquiry, we consider the relative resource structure, which reflects the importance of physical and knowledge resources for individual firms, and examine their respective effects on the selection of cloud computing deployment models (CCDMs). Using data from 520 companies deploying cloud computing in mainland China, we find that firms with higher physical capital intensity (PCI) tend to outsource cloud computing, whereas those with higher knowledge capital intensity (KCI) tend to use private clouds. Firms with higher codified knowledge capital intensity (CKCI) are found to be more susceptible to the negative relationship between KCI and public cloud selection than those with higher tacit knowledge capital intensity (TKCI). The direct positive influence of regional legal protection on a firm's preferences for a public cloud is also confirmed, as well as its indirect moderating effect on alleviating the negative relationships between CKCI and deploying a public cloud. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud computing deployment; Degree of legal protection; Knowledge capital intensity; Physical capital intensity"

Whereas utilitarian consumption accentuates the achievement of predetermined outcomes typical of cognitive consumer behavior, its hedonic counterpart relates to affective consumer behavior in dealing with the emotive and multisensory aspects of the shopping experience. Consequently, while utilitarian consumption activities appeal to the rationality of customers in inducing their intellectual buy-in of the shopping experience, customers’ corresponding emotional buy-in can only be attained through the presence of hedonic consumption activities. The same can be said for online shopping. Because the online shopping environment is characterized by the existence of an IT-enabled web interface that acts as the focal point of contact between customers and vendors, its design should embed utilitarian and hedonic elements to create a holistic shopping experience. Building on Expectation Disconfirmation Theory (EDT), this study advances a research model that not only delineates between customers’ utilitarian and hedonic expectations for online shopping but also highlights how these expectations can be best served through functional and esthetic performance, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce online shopping experience (i.e., transactional frequency) as a moderator affecting not only how customers form utilitarian and hedonic expectations but also how they evaluate the functional and esthetic performances of e-commerce sites. The model is then empirically validated via an online survey questionnaire administered on a sample of 303 respondents. Theoretical contributions and pragmatic implications to be gleaned from our research model and its subsequent empirical validation are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Esthetic performance; Expectation disconfirmation theory; Hedonic expectations; Transactional frequency; Transactional functionalities; Utilitarian expectations"

ODR services are creating new business models and opportunities and reshaping transportation markets. This study used KakaoTaxi, a popular ODR service in Korea, to examine how customers evaluate an ODR service and determine whether customers are willing to reuse such a service. In the first-stage qualitative study, we explored decisional factors by conducting interviews with customers of the ODR service. In the second-stage quantitative study, we interpreted these previously explored decisional factors and developed a research model by applying the customer value theory. Going beyond previous research, the meta-inferences from the qualitative and quantitative studies explain how customers decide to reuse an ODR service. This study also informs ODR service providers of marketing strategies to leverage these key decisional factors in the reuse of an ODR service. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Customer value theory; KakaoTaxi; On-demand ride (ODR) service; Qualitative study; Quantitative study"

A critical piece of information for producers/publishers of content as well as advertisers is the demographics of the consumers who are likely to visit a given web site. In this article we explore predictive models that attempt to deduce the demographics of the audience of a web site using cues embedded in the design or the content of its homepage. We find that it is possible to effectively predict different types of demographics of consumers of web sites on the basis of the suggested approach. Through a statistical analysis we observe that several design elements and the content differ significantly among web sites dominated by consumers of different demographic classes. We also suggest the use of an ensemble classifier that combines the content and design cues with the goal of further improving the prediction performance. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Audience demographics; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Text classification"

However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying social-media-based customer-firm co-creation and their implications for business value in NPD. To address this knowledge gap, this study develops a model from the perspective of organizational learning and social capital to examine how the social-media-based customer-firm co-creation mechanism conceptualized as the structural, cognitive, and relational dimension of social capital influences the first-order knowledge outcome (knowledge transfer effectiveness) and second-order dynamic capability outcome (absorptive capacity), and how these co-creation outcomes ultimately influence organizational performance. The model is tested using survey data from 149 Chinese mobile application developers. The results indicate that social-media-based structural, cognitive, and relational linkage, in particular the structural linkage, is an important co-creation mechanism to improve organizational performance. Knowledge transfer effectiveness and absorptive capacity have significant mediating effects in this co-creation mechanism-outcomes-performance framework. Further, the moderating effects of social media use level on the relationships between co-creation mechanism and outcomes are largely supported. The study contributes to theory and practice by shedding light on the social-media-based customer-firm co-creation in NPD at a process level. © 2019","Business value; Co-creation; Organizational learning; Organizational performance; Social capital; Social media"

However, researchers are not well informed about the shift of PIP research trends with time. In particular, there is a lack of understanding of what constructs have been studied in what contexts. As a result, researchers may design their study without sufficient guidance. This problem can lead to unproductive efforts in advancing PIP research. Therefore, it is important and timely to review prior PIP research to enhance our understanding of how it has evolved. We are particularly interested in understanding the chronological changes in contexts and research constructs studied. We use a chronological stage model of PIP research we develop, a set of contextual variables identified from prior literature, and the four-party PIP model suggested by Conger et al. (2013) as theoretical foundations to conduct a chronological literature review of empirical PIP concern studies. We find several PIP research trends during the last two decades, such as the quantity of PIP research has drastically increased; the variety of contexts and research constructs being studied has increased substantially; and many constructs have been studied only once while only a few have been repeatedly studied. We also find that the focus of PIP research has shifted from general/unspecified contexts to specific ones.

Based on the transaction cycle framework, we explore how a patient's choice for psychological and material compliments is affected by service quality received at different stages, and how the effects vary depending on the service price. Using data collected from an online health community (OHC) in China, we reveal several important findings. First, service quality at each stage is an important driver of patient compliments. Second, high service quality at the pre- and after-sale stages motivate patients to give material compliments rather than psychological compliments, whereas psychological compliment is more likely to be triggered for high service quality received at the during-sale stage. Third, service quality at one stage enhances the effect of service quality at its subsequent stages on compliments. Fourth, service price increases the influence of service quality on compliments, and patients tend to give material returns over psychological returns for doctors charging high service price.

In contrast, employees who experienced fear were less likely to commit computer-related deviant behavior mediated by perceived formal and informal sanctions. The results provide important guidance for organizations to improve the effectiveness of deterrent controls. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Anger; Computer-related deviant behavior; Deterrence theory; Fear"

To understand the public's reaction to emerging infectious diseases, we draw upon theories in psychology and social media, and propose that there is a cyclical relationship between message volume and the intensity of emotions (positive or negative) in which they influence each other positively over time. Furthermore, negative and positive emotions mutually suppress each other, yet are autocorrelated, respectively. Relying on more than 560,000 microblogs collected from Sina Weibo between February 2013 and June 2013 on the outbreak of avian influenza in China, we used vector autoregression to test the research model. We find a cyclical relationship between microblog volume and the intensity of negative emotions (fear in particular, a subcategory of negative emotions). Microblog volume positively contributes to positive emotions. While the intensity of negative emotions, and that of positive emotions is autocorrelated, respectively, surprisingly our results suggest that negative emotion intensity positively affects positive emotion intensity. We further rely on impulse response functions to illustrate how the impacts of a variable on another change over time, and generalized forecast error variance decomposition to understand the importance of each variable contributing to the others.

Buyers often conduct quality inspection on shipments and frame supply contracts to punish quality fraud. Due to cost concerns, buyers need to estimate the suppliers’ fraud possibilities and choose appropriate testing methods and frequencies. As suppliers’ fraud intentions depend on their cost-benefit analysis, it is possible to analyze suppliers’ fraud intention with appropriate modeling of their profit-seeking behavior. In this research, we are interested in how fraud intention analysis may affect the quality inspection process. It should be noted that quality inspection can be a repeated process, with suppliers and buyers conducting multiple rounds of transactions (including transactions with frauds) and learning about each other during the process. Their supply contracts may also affect suppliers’ profit-seeking attitude. We conduct a laboratory experiment to examine the effect of fraud intention analysis systems on inspection decision making considering the learning and contract effects. We put the experiment in the context of a dairy supply chain as a critical and interesting example application. The experiment shows that if there are no strong punitive terms for fraud in the contract, fraud intention analysis can improve buyers’ decision-making efficiency after controlling the learning effect, in terms of decision time, inspection cost, and correctness of rejecting suppliers’ fraudulent shipments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Deception detection; Decision support; Fraud intention analysis; Laboratory experiment; Learning; Supply chain quality inspection; Supply contract"

However, information regarding the mechanism of tacit knowledge sharing is limited. Accordingly, we develop a nonlinear dynamic model to explore the influence of structural changes on tacit knowledge sharing behavior in an IT R&D team, particularly in response to gradual changes in payoff structures. The following results were observed：(1) Certain situations and a traditional correlation analysis confirmed that the current contradictions in the influence of reward systems on knowledge sharing behavior are unified. (2) Under special conditions, the influences of several critical factors (e.g., reciprocity, penalty of social reputation, and supervising mechanism) lose efficacy. As an alternative, managers can only enhance the reward system or reduce sharing cost. The effectiveness of knowledge sharing substantially improves only once it reaches certain critical thresholds. (3) During a catastrophe, a team's behavior may become immune to the deterioration of payoff structures. However, sudden jumps (i.e., from sharing to hiding knowledge) may occur when another threshold is reached. In summary, once team members experience a sudden jump, retrieving the previous cooperative status becomes difficult. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","IT R&D team; Payoff structures; Structural changes; Tacit knowledge hiding; Tacit knowledge sharing"

However, the process by which emotion produces influence in online social media networks is relatively unknown. Previous works focus largely on sentiment classification and polarity identification but do not adequately consider the way emotion affects user influence. This research developed a novel framework, a theory-based model, and a proof-of-concept system for dissecting emotion and user influence in social media networks. The system models emotion-triggered influence and facilitates analysis of emotion-influence causality in the context of U.S. border security (using 5,327,813 tweets posted by 1,303,477 users). Motivated by a theory of emotion spread, the model was integrated in an influence-computation method, called the interaction modeling (IM) approach, which was compared with a benchmark using a user centrality (UC) approach based on social positions. IM was found to have identified influential users who are more broadly related to U.S. cultural issues. Influential users tended to express intense emotions of fear, anger, disgust, and sadness. The emotion trust distinguishes influential users from others, whereas anger and fear contributed significantly to causing user influence.

According to this evolution, research on RSes has produced a wide variety of approaches and algorithms. As a consequence, the companies deploying RSes in their business applications face the decision of how to generate and deliver personalized recommendations to their users by choosing among many options. The problem has been largely treated from the machine learning performance perspective because there is relatively little research done from the business perspective. The decision of what kind of recommender engines should be used in a personalization application, given certain business conditions, has a strategic value because it affects the way customers perceive the company with respect to its competitors. Choosing the wrong way to personalize recommendations may not only require the redesign of the information systems but also to rebuild the relationships with customers and even the entire brand strategic positioning. The research issues addressed by this paper are (i) which recommendation strategies a company can deploy to generate and deliver recommendations to users, and (ii) which specific strategies should be used depending on the current business conditions.

In the most common form of crowdsourcing, teams that offer solutions compete for rewards. Thus, a question of interest is whether competition is a key crowdsourcing characteristic that influences how teams allocate their effort and achieve desired performance. Motivated by this question, we investigate how competition moderates the relationship between self-efficacy and effort using comprehensive, time-variant data collected from crowdsourcing teams that completed a project under competitive and non-competitive conditions. Under competitive conditions, self-efficacy shows a positive effect on effort, which in turn, affects performance positively. Whereas, under noncompetitive conditions, self-efficacy has a negative effect on effort and subsequently on performance. Our results also show a recursive relationship between self-efficacy and performance, in which performance subsequently affects self-efficacy positively. Thus, inducing a sense of competition through competitive reward structures and IT-based “gaming elements” helps improve team effort and subsequent performance. We also tested for mediation of team motivation in the self-efficacy and effort relationship, and we found that motivation partially mediates the relationship.

Though the relationship between consumer reviews and sales has been extensively studied, only few studies have been conducted on the effects of different review designs. In this paper, we collect detailed review data from Meituan.com, a popular Chinese shopping website, to examine the effects of numerical presentation of consumer reviews (detailed to one decimal place) and graphical presentation of consumer reviews (in half-stars) on sales. By using a regression discontinuity design, we find that while consumer review scores may affect sales positively, the star presentation can create negative, rather than positive, jumps at cutoffs. Consumers restrict their attention to a star category; therefore, the “best” sellers in a lower star category are better off than the “worst” sellers in a higher star category. The incentive for review manipulation is strongly reduced, which in the long run will create trust and confidence for the review system as well as the sellers. For those sellers that are just below the cutoffs, simply crossing over the cutoffs would not lead to higher sales. Instead, they will have to substantially improve their service quality to attract consumers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Consumer review; E-commerce; Regression discontinuity"

To do so, we integrate the theory of interpersonal influence and leadership, adaptive structuration theory, and the literature on user resistance and behavioral IS theories, and develop a comprehensive theoretical model anchored in (a) social influence tactics, (b) IT artifact perceptions, and (c) user resistance and subsequent behaviors. The resultant theoretical model explains how influence tactics modulate user perceptions, user resistance to the system, and ultimately the unfaithful use of the system. This model is tested in the context of an electronic medical record (EMR) system implementation, with a sample of 442 clinicians who were exposed to various influence tactics and with the use of SEM techniques. The results indicate that certain influence tactics are beneficial in reducing user resistance while others can unintentionally increase resistance. Resistance, in turn, drives adaptive user behaviors in the form of unfaithful use of the system. Thus, it is possible to manipulate resistance and resultant adaptive behaviors through influence tactics, without necessarily altering the IT artifact. This is particularly important, as many off-the-shelf IT artifacts cannot be substantially modified. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","EMR implementation; Healthcare; Influence tactics; Medical informatics; Unfaithful use; User resistance"

Prior studies have mainly focused on the direct effect of IT use on innovation performance, while little is known about how IT use for different purposes in the innovation processes leads to innovation performance at the organizational level. Drawing on the routine-based absorptive capacity (AC) framework, we conceptualize IT use for knowledge search and relational search as IT-enabled internal and external AC routines and unveil the hierarchical benefits resulting from IT use for innovation. We propose a model in which firms need to purposefully use IT to search for knowledge in the new product development process or search for relationships in the collaborative innovation process, leading to first-order benefits (i.e., internal innovation benefits and open innovation benefits) and, in turn, second-order benefits (i.e., innovation performance). By using a unique data set from 1028 German firms between 2003 and 2007, we find that IT use for knowledge search enhances internal innovation benefits, whereas IT use for relational search increases open innovation benefits. More importantly, internal and open innovation benefits mediate the relationships between IT use for knowledge and relational search and various innovation performance measures.

To fill this gap, we conducted a research study among users of Moments, a large SNS in China. Based on the conservation of resources (COR) theory, we hypothesized that SNS users’ response to role stress, a subtype of stress, might be positive, leading to investments in social resources (e.g., motivation for relationship maintenance and self-presentation) and generating an increased level of self-disclosure on SNS. The survey results revealed the mediating effect of motivation for relationship maintenance and self-presentation on the SNS stress–disclosure relationship. We found that SNS users conserve their resources by maintaining relationships and presenting themselves positively in response to role stress, as predicted.

To achieve this goal, a qualitative approach was adopted, through a case study of the e-library of a University in Portugal. The data were obtained from direct observation, interviews with various actors (staff of the library, computing and administration services of this institution) involved in the process of implementing and maintaining the e-library, and also the documentary analysis. The empirical evidence obtained reveals the most relevant factors for e-library success to be: (1) minimization of costs, (2) acceptance and use of e-libraries, and (3) staff training. This study shows the great importance of library staff training regarding use and exploitation of the e-library's functions. Thorough knowledge of the e-library means improved use and search effectiveness. The minimization of costs associated with its implementation and maintenance is also a factor determining its success.

We contextualize innovation speed of OSS projects as initial release speed and update speed and examine their impacts on user interest. Drawing on the signaling theory, we propose a signaling effect through which a higher initial release speed or update speed increases user interest, while the effect diminishes as initial release or update speed increases.

However, it is yet to specifically consider it in the context of the unique characteristics of big data. Yet, organizations have a high appetite for big data, and there is growing evidence that investments in big data solutions do not always lead to the derivation of intended value. Accordingly, there is a need for rigorous academic guidance on what factors enable effective use of big data. With this paper, we aim to guide IS researchers such that the expansion of the body of knowledge on the effective use of big data can proceed in a structured and systematic manner and can subsequently lead to empirically driven guidance for organizations. Namely, with this paper, we cast a wide net to understand and consolidate from literature the potential factors that can influence the effective use of big data, so they may be further studied. To do so, we first conduct a systematic literature review. Our review identifies 41 factors, which we categorize into 7 themes, namely data quality; data privacy and security and governance; perceived organizational benefit; process management; people aspects; systems, tools, and technologies; and organizational aspects. To explore the existence of these themes in practice, we then analyze 45 published case studies that document insights into how specific companies use big data successfully. Finally, we propose a framework for the study of effective use of big data as a basis for future research.

Each of the three constructs was further decomposed into two first-order constructs, participating and browsing for SNS behavior, bonding and bridging social capital for social capital, and giving and receiving for SCI. The results, which were based on 970 effective samples of Facebook users, supported several findings. Both SNS behavior and social capital affect SCI, while the relationship between SNS behavior and SCI is partially mediated by the bonding and bridging social capital.

All of the relationships between first-order constructs tested significant, with the single exception that browsing of SNS behavior did not lead to the giving of SCI. This study also applied post hoc analysis for better understanding SCI on SNSs. The results showed that browsing of SNS behavior has a stronger impact than participating of SNS behavior on either bonding or bridging social capital.

The reason is that vendors compare CSP with ISP and are able to evaluate depending on perceived acquisition utility; consumers, however, see either CSP or ISP, resulting in difficulty in accessing acquisition utility. Thus, they evaluate according to perceived transaction utility. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Acquisition-transaction utility; Cooperative sales promotion; Evaluation mode; Independent sales promotion; Misprediction; Product evaluation"

Taking social media analytics as an example, this paper is among the first attempts to theoretically explain and empirically test the market performance impact of big data analytics. Drawing on the systems theory, we explain how and why social media analytics create super-additive value through the synergies in functional complementarity between social media diversity for gathering big data from diverse social media channels and big data analytics for analyzing the gathered big data. Furthermore, we deepen our theorizing by considering the difference between small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and large firms in the required integration effort that enables the synergies of social media diversity and big data analytics. In line with this theorizing, we empirically test the synergistic effect of social media diversity and big data analytics by using a recent large-scale survey data set from 18,816 firms in Italy. We find that social media diversity and big data analytics have a positive interaction effect on market performance, which is more salient for SMEs than for large firms. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Big data analytics; Business value of information technology; Digital innovation; Market performance; Social media analytics; Synergies"

We found substantial evidence supporting our hypothesis that information security breaches do, indeed, have a competition effect: when one firm is breached, its competitors have opportunities to absorb market power. For the IT security investment announcements, however, we observed the positive externalities, or contagion effect, in play: market investors feel that the security investments made by one firm increase the security level of the entire network, and hence, competitors also get benefits.

Simultaneously, the moderating effects of uncertainty and the degree of process innovation on the relationship between BSL and supply chain performance are also estimated. The analytical results indicated that proactive technological orientation, information technology (IT) connectivity, supply chain member pressure, and member relationship quality encourage firms to combine their business systems with those of other business partners. Interestingly, in a situation where there is high demand and an uncertain supply, the impact of BSL on supply chain performance is low, while the moderating effect of process innovation on the relationship between BSL and supply chain performance is significant. Finally, it is suggested that firms implementing BSL work to upgrade their technology maintain tight relationships with supply chain partners and create innovation in all aspects of their business processes in order to survive in the highly competitive IT environment. © 2019","Business systems leveraging (BSL); Information sharing; Process innovation; Supply chain performance; Uncertainty"

Impulsiveness served as a moderator affecting the relationship between consumer attitudes and behavior. Eight scenarios were designed to test the effects of post characteristics on consumer responses and purchase behavior. Hedonic and utilitarian products were used in the scenarios to compare the differences among different product types. A total of 908 valid questionnaires were collected. The results of the data analysis indicated that consumers who process messages through the central route tend to respond to the post before initiating purchase intention. On the other hand, consumers who process messages through the peripheral route tend to initiate purchase intention directly if they feel favorable toward a post. Regarding the post characteristics, post popularity was found to be the most crucial factor related to enhancing perceived persuasiveness. According to the results and findings, it is suggested that sellers on the Facebook Second-hand Marketplace should provide messages about their product as accurately as completely as possible to strengthen positive impressions of their posts. Otherwise, they need to provide an interesting introduction or esthetic pictures to attract consumer attention. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Elaboration likelihood model; Facebook second-hand marketplace; Impulsiveness; Product types"

Nevertheless, the extent to which action research is published in good journals is infrequent enough to indicate a serious problem. In this article, we explore the reasons underlying this situation and make recommendations aiming to increase both the practice and the publication of action research. To identify both the barriers to undertaking action research and potential ways of overcoming those barriers, we survey 218 authors of 120 articles demonstrating empirical action research published in 12 of our good journals during the period 1982–2016. We received 70 usable responses. We also surveyed 52 editors of selected IS journals and received 25 usable responses. Our findings are revealing as they indicate both genuine barriers associated with action research and some apparent barriers that are in reality misperceptions or myths. In reflecting on these, we emphasize the special qualities of action research. We also reflect on the critical role that action research plays in the IS field as a whole and its potential for further contributions to research and practice, given the strong and close connections with organizational problem contexts that action research requires. Finally, we make a number of recommendations that are designed to increase the incidence of action research in the IS discipline © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Action research; Doctoral studies; Engaged research; Journals; Publishing; Relevance; Rigor"

ICT has the potential to affect many aspects of economic and societal activities such as GDP growth, employment, productivity, poverty alleviation, quality of life, education, and healthcare. While the literature provides a myriad of definitions and elements of socio-economic development, the focus tends to be on theoretical conceptualizations from various disciplines and impacts from isolated individual projects. In particular, the impact of ICT on socio-economic development has not been carefully examined from the viewpoint of the ultimate stakeholder, the citizens of a country, who are the final consumers of the technology. This study fills this gap by focusing on the citizens’ view in describing ICT-driven socio-economic development in a developing country. A theoretical framework influenced by the “capabilities approach” was developed to guide this research, and the interpretive stance was used to conduct the study. More specifically, the narrative research method, which is seldom used in IS research but is appropriate for this study, was used. Narratives allow deeper and profound insights into social representations and participants' beliefs about the role of ICT in socio-economic development. Using this methodology, a model of the impact dimensions of socio-economic development is presented. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Capabilities approach; Functionalities; ICT for development; Impacts; Narrative research; Socio-economic development"

Such a move is intended to encourage the eventual purchase of the full version software. Offering a trial version could psychologically influence an individual (i.e., arousing emotions as joy from playing the game), thereby heightening his or her willingness to pay (WTP) for the full version software, for which the individual's fundamental nature of self-control might avert him or her from doing so — the psychological paradox. Considering that a game software trial version is usually restricted through the permitted grace period (time restriction) or the extent of functionality available for use (functionality restriction), this research examines the psychological effects of these two forms of trial restrictions on users by anchoring on the opponent-process theory. Results from an online study involving 128 users reveal that imposing functionality restriction could lead to strong negative consequences on users’ cognitive absorption but heighten users’ self-control outcomes. Interestingly, imposing time restriction does not have an observable effect on these two variables. These findings provide insightful theoretical and practical implications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cognitive absorption; Functionality restriction; Game software trial; Self-control outcomes; Time restriction"

While the need for monitoring is generally agreed upon by both re- searchers and practitioners alike, the means and mechanisms are often vague. This is especially salient with the fast growing availability of various technologies to monitor in real-time through recent advances such as the Internet of Things (IoT) with specific emphasis on Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) and associated sensor networks. This study is motivated by the lack of published literature in data acquisition and analytics that specifically addresses sufficient real-time data acquisition for effective managerial monitoring. As a step in addressing this void, we review and extend existing literature in this general area by studying various requirements and information sources that relate to effective management monitoring. We then design an exploratory study to evaluate current managerial monitoring needs and the importance of automated data collection technologies. Results from this study show that the most important latent factor that influences an organization's information need is its dynamic competitiveness, and consequently, companies with a dynamic supply chain would need a faster transaction and operations data system. The second important latent factor is the behavioral performance, which renders it essential to have a human-centric data system.

However, recent research in psychology concludes that such deliberate, rational, conscious decision-making (termed System 2 cognition) has less influence on behavior than originally thought; nonconscious automatic cognition (termed System 1 cognition), which is often influenced by personality characteristics and pattern matching based on past experience, also plays a key role in most decisions. As users adopt and use new technologies time and time again, a set of general expectations about new technology adoption begins to emerge. A user's personality combined with this pattern of positive and negative experiences creates System 1 heuristics that are triggered when a user faces a similar decision in the future. The focus of this paper is to examine the extent to which the predispositions produced by System 1 automatic cognition – both enabling and inhibiting – versus the deliberate technology assessment produced by System 2 cognition influence technology adoption and use. We found that enabling predispositions influences the formation of intentions to use a new technology, and both enabling and inhibiting predispositions influence an individual's ultimate follow through in acting on his or her intentions and actually using new technologies. Our research suggests that concepts previously seen as “determinants” of technology adoption and use (e.g., performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions) are not really determinants but rather are important partial mediators in a larger nomological network that includes both automatic System 1 cognition and deliberate System 2 cognition. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Automatic cognition; Deliberate cognition; Duality; Enabling beliefs; Inhibiting beliefs; Predisposition; System 1 cognition; System 2 cognition; Technology adoption; Technology readiness contributor; Technology readiness inhibitor; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology"

In applying the push–pull–mooring model, the objective of this study was to gain an understanding of specifically how push, pull, and mooring factors shape their switching intentions. The findings revealed that push effect, in terms of low transaction efficiency, drives customers away from e-commerce sites, whereas the pull effects, including social presence, social support, social benefit, and self-presentation, attract customers to social commerce sites. Moreover, mooring effects, including conformity and personal experience, strengthened consumers’ behavior in switching between e-commerce and social commerce sites.

The market demand might be subject to disruption, but the retailer can get access to some signals from social media platforms to better forecast the market state (regular or disrupted) even though the signals might be not fully reliable. Different from the traditional information sharing literature, we incorporate the shutdown policy into our model. We first characterize the equilibrium outcomes under both with- and without-information sharing cases and then examine the players’ preferences over information sharing or not. It is shown that when the level of information reliability is relatively low, the manufacturer prefers the information sharing cases, whereas the retailer prefers the no-sharing case, and information sharing does harm to the whole channel. In addition, our results show that as the level of information reliability increases, the manufacturer benefits more but the retailer and the whole channel lose more from information sharing. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, when the level of information reliability falls into an intermediary interval, the retailer will have an incentive to share information, and information sharing will benefit the manufacturer and the whole supply chain. However, the benefits from information sharing decrease as the level of information reliability increases. When the level of information reliability is sufficiently high, both firms are indifferent between the information sharing and no-sharing cases. Additionally, the incorporation of the shutdown policy has important implications for the information sharing issue, and thus, the policy should not be overlooked. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Information reliability; Information sharing; Market disruption; Shutdown policy"

Through a case analysis of two communities focused on discussing recreational drugs, our findings demonstrate that norm formation is influenced by two phenomena: (1) norm acceptance, and (2) norm transience. Norm acceptance requires that moderators be consistent in their expression of norms. To a lesser extent, moderators must be credible in their expression of norms. If these things occur, the community will accept the norms. Norm transience, on the other hand, occurs when moderators are not sensitive to the community identity. If accepted norms are not aligned with community identity, they will be dropped by the community within one or two years. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Beliefs; Framing analysis; Norms; Online communities"

An important assumption of this perspective is that higher order judgments such as quality perception and download intention are mainly cognitive processes. Increasingly, research has shown that this perspective is incapable of fully explaining user judgments. Emerging research posits that emotions and emotional subcomponents that arise from aesthetic-based design factors are at least equally important for understanding how users form higher order judgments such as quality perception and attractiveness. In this article, light is shed on the role of emotions in affecting these judgments. This is performed for the particular case of mobile apps. Specifically, the relationship between various aesthetic subdimensions (classical and expressive) and emotional subcomponents (valence and arousal) is explored. First, an explanatory model from theories of aesthetics, emotions, and visual perception is derived. Second, a laboratory experiment is conducted, and it provides empirical evidence for the relationships between visual aesthetics, emotions, and higher order evaluations such as users’ quality perceptions and the intentions to download. Specifically, significant relationships were found between aesthetic subdimensions and valence, whereas arousal was partially significant. Selective emotional subdimensions also significantly impacted quality perceptions, attractiveness, and intention to download.

Solvers compete in these tournaments to earn rewards. In such competitive environments, it is imperative that solvers provide creative solutions with minimum effort. This article explores the factors that influence the solvers’ effort allocation decisions in a dynamic tournament setting. Specifically, comprehensive time variant data of teams that participated in crowdsourcing competitions on Kaggle were analyzed to gain insight into how solvers continually formulate strategies in light of performance feedback obtained through interim ranking. The results suggest that solvers strategically allocate their efforts throughout the contest to dynamically optimize their payoffs through balancing the probability of winning and the cost of expending effort. In particular, solvers tend to increase their efforts toward the end of tournaments or when they get closer to winning positions. Furthermore, our findings indicate that a last-minute surge in effort is more prevalent among high-skill solvers than in those with lower skill levels. In addition to providing insights that may help solvers develop strategies to improve their performance, the study has implications for the design of online crowdsourcing platforms, particularly in terms of incentivizing solvers to put forth their best effort. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Crowdsourcing; Innovation tournaments; Sniping; Social comparison; Solver strategies"

In this study, we rely on theories of risk deterrence in decision-making and the “risky/choice shift” logic to suggest that the social identification of users regarding their community members skews the way they consider risks in decision-making on these sites. Using data from 175 users of etsy.com, we show that perceived commerce risk reduces intentions to buy from the website and that perceived participation risk curtails intentions to post comments on social commerce forums. The findings further show that the influence of these risk assessments is reduced when the degree of social identification with the website community increases; these risk considerations become negligible in decision-making processes when ’social identification is one standard deviation above the mean.

Our study investigates a type of illusion of agreement known as the Abilene Paradox in requirements determination. The Abilene Paradox refers to situations in which each member of a group believes (incorrectly) that the other group members want to pursue a particular course of action, which leads everyone to avoid conflict by agreeing to the action publicly while disagreeing privately. We first provide theory underlying the paradox and review past literature. We then build theory to motivate our investigation and generate hypotheses. We then report results of a laboratory experiment utilizing group requirements determination efforts. Results indicated behavior consistent with the presence of the paradox and an illusion of agreement. These results have important implications for research and practice in requirements determination specifically and systems development in general. Our results contribute to both the requirements determination literature and the literature on illusions of agreement and social conformity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Abilene Paradox; Conflict; Group conformity; Illusion of agreement; Information requirements determination; Joint application development; User participation"

However, current studies are limited in investigating the concept of social commerce engagement and the processes through which social commerce engagement is established. Drawing upon interpersonal attraction theory and relationship management perspective, this study proposes a research model to address the influences of technology attractiveness, which is composed of task, social, and physical attractiveness, on social commerce involvement and engagement. Considering that social interactions in social commerce community are often stimulated by users’ common interests in products and consumption activities, the moderating role of personal interest is further examined by applying personality literature to reveal how technology attractiveness and community involvement take effect in the social commerce context. Empirical results indicate that all the three aspects of technology attractiveness (i.e., task, social, and physical attractiveness) are positively associated with community involvement, which in turn affects social commerce engagement. In particular, involvement fully mediates the impact of physical attractiveness and partially mediates the effects of task and social attractiveness. Personal interest enhances the effect of social attractiveness, whereas it weakens the effect of physical attractiveness on community involvement. Personal interest also strengthens the positive relationship between community involvement and social commerce engagement. Findings emerged from this study will contribute to the current understanding of how social commerce engagement is formed and help practitioners improve community attractiveness and deliver differential attractiveness to users with different levels of personal interest. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Community involvement; Customer engagement; Personal interest; Social commerce; Technology attractiveness"

To ensure that the public health reporting system is appropriately monitoring the rare infectious diseases under surveillance, it is recommended to have a regular assessment of timeliness, especially after the rare infectious case is confirmed. This study aimed to evaluate the timeliness of data reported to the Ohio Disease Reporting System (ODRS), a public health reporting system in Ohio, for managing rare infectious diseases. In a cross-sectional analysis of rare infectious disease reporting data in four local health jurisdictions (LHJs) in the state of Ohio, wide delays were found between various reporting steps, particularly when the laboratories were not using the electronic method of reporting, and the delay observed was mainly at the hospital level and at the LHJ level. This study highlights the supply chain nature of information transfer and calculates the delay at various interacting points of the information supply chain system. The results establish that a centralized approach with an electronic disease reporting system conveys information faster than traditional reporting channels (decentralized approach).

Consumers are increasingly seeking serendipity in online shopping, where information clutter and preprogramed recommendation systems can make product choice frustrating or mundane. However, it is notoriously difficult to design online shopping environments that induce it. In this study, we explore how social media affordances such as obtaining access to peer-generated content and being connected to online friends can help create the right conditions for serendipity in online shopping. We supplement this analysis with an account of two individual factors that are also likely to be instrumental in a shopping context, namely, the intensity of shoppers’ information search and their aversion to risk when faced with a product choice. Our investigation relies on a conceptualization of serendipity that has two defining elements: unexpectedness and informational value. The results of an experimental study in which we manipulated an online product search environment reveal the superiority of designs that incorporate online friendships, and these results support the positive effects of search effort and risk aversion on serendipity.

The field effect is exerted by the reach and richness of network features, which virtually form a psychological pressure on one's perception of the sharing situation. A research model is developed, in which the effects of extrinsic and intrinsic motivators on information-sharing continuance are moderated by the network features of social media platforms. A global sample from content contributors in two major social media platform contexts, experience-socialization (ES) platforms (N = 568) and intelligence-proliferation (IP) platforms (N = 653), were collected through the participatory research method. By using partial least-square analysis, the moderating effects of network features on cognitive-sharing processes under the two contexts were confirmed. For contributors on ES platforms, network features negatively moderate community identification and perceived enjoyment toward information sharing. By contrast, for contributors on IP platforms, network features negatively moderate the effects of perceived usefulness and altruistic tendencies on their intention to share, but self-efficacy for sharing is positively induced. The conceptualization of network features and refined knowledge about the situational and contextual effects of social media platforms are useful for further studies on social behaviors and may ultimately benefit platform providers in their attempts to promote information-sharing continuance. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Extrinsic motivation; Information-sharing continuance; Intrinsic motivation; Network features; Reach and richness; Social media"

By exploiting large volumes of sentimental text, we can extract user preferences to enhance sales, develop marketing strategies, and optimize supply chain for electronic commerce. Pieces of information in the social web are usually short, such as tweets, questions, instant messages, messages, and news headlines. Short text differs from normal text because of its sparse word co-occurrence patterns, which hampers efforts to apply social emotion classification models. Most existing methods focus on either exploiting the social emotions of individual words or the association of social emotions with latent topics learned from normal documents. In this paper, we propose a topic-level maximum entropy (TME) model for social emotion classification over short text. TME generates topic-level features by modeling latent topics, multiple emotion labels, and valence scored by numerous readers jointly. The overfitting problem in the maximum entropy principle is also alleviated by mapping the features to the concept space. An experiment on real-world short documents validates the effectiveness of TME on social emotion classification over sparse words. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Public opinion mining; Short-text analysis; Social emotion classification; Topic-level maximum entropy model"

By drawing on arguments from resource-based views, transaction cost economics and industrial organisations, we look inside these mechanisms by assessing whether in regard to creation and capture of economic value hotels should pay more attention to diversify the number of OTAs that distribute their services or to improve their reputation through travellers’ reviews posted on TripAdvisor. Gathering data on 62,865 travellers’ reviews on TripAdvisor and on the presence of hotels on multiple OTAs, we built a panel dataset of 355 hotels spanning from 2004 to 2014 and also including hotels’ financial data. Fixed effects regression models show that hotels listed on multiple OTA bolster sales revenue and operating profitability. We demonstrated that for hotels, the online visibility on OTAs counts more on value capture than the online reputation gained on TripAdvisor. Through the presence on multiple OTAs, hotels are expected to have a higher bargaining power towards each individual distributor. We discuss the implications of these results on the way hotels, OTAs and TripAdvisor can generate and capture value in the vertical chain of the travel industry. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Hotels; Online customer reviews; OTAs; Value capture; Value creation"

Although it is generally believed that gratification reflects the gains through use and that addiction is caused by excessive use of the technology, limited research has been done to empirically verify the relationship between usage patterns and gratification versus addiction. This paper attempts to explore the impacts of posting patterns on gratification and addiction dimensions for microblog platforms. On the basis of existing literature on use and gratifications of media users, we focus on examining the different posting patterns between weekdays and weekends. By using multiple data collection methods, a data set was obtained consisting of 308 microblog users. Our analysis shows that the overall posting frequency is not significantly related to gratification and addiction levels. Moreover, the posting of microblogs is usually more intensive on weekdays than on weekends. Heavy weekend users tend to feel more socially gratified and are most likely to be addicted. In contrast, heavy weekday users are usually not addicted, and reported the lowest levels of gratification among all users. Balanced users that do not display distinguishable difference between weekdays and weekends manifest gratification levels around the average levels, and are less addicted than weekend users, even if their overall usage amounts are heavy. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Addiction; Microblog; Use and gratification; Weekdays and weekends"

Our work makes two principal contributions to the understanding of the value of IT. First, the article shows that externally oriented IT-based capabilities have a greater impact on the firm's intra-industry differential in revenue growth and profitability than those capabilities focused on efficiency improvement, namely internally oriented IT-based capabilities. Essentially, this result is consistent with two facts: i) the greater importance that market and supply chain relationships have for firms with a limited scale compared to efficiency improvement, and ii) the greater social and organizational complexity captured by IT use in firm's external relationships. Second, through a contingent perspective, our article shows that the returns of externally oriented IT-based capabilities are more likely to provide performance advantages to SMEs in contexts of low munificence and low dynamism. This evidence thus highlights that under these environmental conditions, IT is more likely to hinder than to facilitate SMEs’ ability to respond to market changes and new opportunities. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Competitive advantage; Contingent approach; IT-based capabilities; Performance differential; Resource-based view; Small and medium enterprises"

Researchers have developed sophisticated procedures to build and validate multi-item scales that measure latent constructs. The vast majority of IS studies uses classical test theory (CTT), but this approach suffers from three major theoretical shortcomings: (1) it assumes a linear relationship between the latent variable and observed scores, which rarely represents the empirical reality of behavioral constructs; (2) the true score can either not be estimated directly or only by making assumptions that are difficult to be met; and (3) parameters such as reliability, discrimination, location, or factor loadings depend on the sample being used. To address these issues, we present item response theory (IRT) as a collection of viable alternatives for measuring continuous latent variables by means of categorical indicators (i.e., measurement variables). IRT offers several advantages: (1) it assumes nonlinear relationships; (2) it allows more appropriate estimation of the true score; (3) it can estimate item parameters independently of the sample being used; (4) it allows the researcher to select items that are in accordance with a desired model; and (5) it applies and generalizes concepts such as reliability and internal consistency, and thus allows researchers to derive more information about the measurement process. We use a CTT approach as well as Rasch models (a special class of IRT models) to demonstrate how a scale for measuring hedonic aspects of websites is developed under both approaches. The results illustrate how IRT can be successfully applied in IS research and provide better scale results than CTT. We conclude by explaining the most appropriate circumstances for applying IRT, as well as the limitations of IRT. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Classical test theory; Hedonic IS; Hedonism; Item response theory; Measurement; Measures; Rasch model; Reliability; Scale development"

The method mainly consists of two steps: route recommendation and online detection. In the first step, route candidates are generated by using a route recommendation algorithm. In the second step, an online anomalous trajectory detection approach is presented to find taxis that have driving anomalies. Experiments evaluate the validity of our method on large-scale, real-world taxi GPS trajectories. Finally, several value-added applications benefiting from big data analysis over taxi's GPS data sets are discussed for potential commercial applications. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Behavior analysis; GPS big data; Taxi service; Trajectory detection"

Because of their popularity, firms and organizations are now marketing their business on SNS pages. It is essential for both SNS providers and firms to retain their current members. Consequently, use continuity of SNSs has gained the attention of both practitioners and researchers. However, few studies have systematically examined gender differences in such a context. To address this gap, we have developed an advanced framework to explain and analyze gender differences in users’ SNS continuance decisions. We propose an SNS continuance model by integrating SNS-oriented constructs (perceived privacy risk, perceived enjoyment, perceived reputation, and community identification) into the established ECM-ISC model and introduce gender as a key moderator. Our research results indicate that all the added SNS-oriented constructs influence users’ SNS continuance directly and indirectly. Furthermore, the impact of each factor on SNS continuance varies by gender. Each gender bases SNS continuance decisions on a different set of factors and/or different weights of the same factors. This study provides evidence that gender effects should be considered in understanding the continued usage of SNSs. It also provides an opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of gender differences in SNS continuance and fills the research gap regarding this.

We then empirically examined how VAI influences the empowerment effect of ERMS. Involving 120 emergency rescuers who have just finished rescue tasks, our experiment shows that VAI has important effects on a user's cognitive and emotional routes, which are significant empowering enablers that lead to positive empowerment outcomes. Interestingly, virtual peer advisor empowers users mostly through evoking emotional resonance from them, whereas virtual expert advisor is better at empowering users through cognitive channels.

Analyzing and measuring WoM is quite valuable in product design, sales prediction, marketing strategy, and other decision-making tasks. In contrast to previous studies that analyze product WoM focusing on a single product, we propose an influence framework to measure WoM from a market perspective. In this framework, we combine product competition relationships and customer intercommunication relationships to construct a two-layer network and calculate the node influence effects in the network. To compare different product WoM measures, we use product sales as a predictor and build a series of predictive models. In the experiments conducted based on Amazon.com data, we find that, first, textual sentiment analysis produces a better summary of customer opinions than rating scores. Second, product-comparative relationships provide additional information on measuring product WoM. Third, the customer intercommunication feature in social media is useful for measuring the collective opinions about a product. The influence framework and experimental findings have both theoretical and managerial implications. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Product network; Product sales; Sentiment analysis; Social influence; Word of mouth"

Social relation has been conceptualized in terms of how organizational relationships with social entities facilitate and/or inhibit organizational learning. In particular, we examine how two different relational structures—single vendor dominant model and multi-vendor dominant model—are associated with two types of organizational learning, namely, exploitative and exploratory. Furthermore, we investigate how three critical dimensions—structural (core vs. non-core functions), affective (partnership vs. transaction), and cognitive (business value vs. IT capability)—in social relation affect the relationships between the two relational structures and the two types of organizational learning in the context of IT outsourcing. The proposed hypotheses were tested using 203 Korean client firms that have adopted the multi-vendor approach in IT outsourcing. Results reveal that the single vendor dominant model exerts a more significant effect on exploitative learning than exploratory learning. By contrast, the multi-vendor dominant model has a more significant effect on the latter than the former. Furthermore, out of the six moderating variables, four (core IT function, non-core IT function, partnership relationship, and transaction relationship) have significant influences on exploitative and exploratory learning. We conclude with theoretical contributions in the area of social relation theory and IT outsourcing literature, and implications for practices on how clients can enhance engagement in exploitative and exploratory learning to reap the benefits of multi-vendor outsourcing. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Multi-vendor dominant model; Multi-vendor outsourcing; Organizational learning; Relational structures; Single vendor dominant model; Social relation perspective"

To achieve a competitive advantage, it is often necessary to listen to and understand what customers are saying about competitors' products and services. Current social media analytics frameworks do not provide benchmarks that allow businesses to compare customer sentiment on social media to easily understand where businesses are doing well and where they need to improve. In this paper, we present a social media competitive analytics framework with sentiment benchmarks that can be used to glean industry-specific marketing intelligence. Based on the idea of the proposed framework, new social media competitive analytics with sentiment benchmarks can be developed to enhance marketing intelligence and to identify specific actionable areas in which businesses are leading and lagging to further improve their customers' experience using customer opinions gleaned from social media.

This paper is intended to investigate the effect of users' demographics, social network site experience, personal social network size, and blogging productivity on privacy disclosure behaviors by analyzing the data collected from social network sites. Based on two levels of disclosed privacy sensitivity information, the textual information of a user's blog postings can be converted into a 4-tuple to represent their privacy disclosure patterns, containing the breadth and depth of disclosure, and frequencies of highly and less sensitive disclosures. Collections of a user's privacy disclosure patterns in social network sites can effectively reflect the user's privacy disclosure behaviors. Applying the general linear modeling approach to blogging data converted with a coding scheme, we find that males and females have significantly differentiated privacy disclosure patterns in dimensions related to the breadth and depth of disclosure. In addition, age has a significant negative relationship with the breadth and depth of disclosure, as well as with highly sensitive disclosure. We also find that social network site experience, personal social network size, and blog length are not significantly related to users' privacy disclosure patterns, while blog number always has positive associations with privacy disclosure patterns. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved .","Generalized linear model; Privacy disclosure; Social media; Social network sites"

These communities are different from general online communities. The knowledge shared in an OHC can be categorized as either general (public) or specific (private), and each category is shared in vastly different ways. Using the social exchange theory, we propose a benefit vs. cost knowledge sharing model for OHCs. The benefits are mainly based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and the cost includes cognitive and executional costs. We use this benefit vs. cost model to examine how OHC members share general and specific knowledge. Data were collected from 323 users of two well-known OHCs in China and were analyzed using the structural equation model. The results demonstrate that three factors positively impact the sharing of both general and specific knowledge: a sense of self-worth, members’ perceived social support, and reputation enhancement. Another factor, face concern, has a negative influence on specific knowledge sharing and a positive influence on general knowledge sharing. Executional cost only negatively impacts general knowledge sharing, and cognitive cost only negatively impacts specific knowledge sharing. This study of OHCs reveals that personal benefits promote knowledge sharing and costs prohibit it. These impacts vary between general knowledge and specific knowledge sharing. © 2016","Knowledge sharing; Maslow's hierarchy of needs; Online health community; Social exchange"

(Manage. Sci. 35 (1989) 982-1003), user attitudes have been considered an important determinant of IS adoption. Their impact on behavior is rooted in behavioral frameworks such as the theory of reasoned action (Fishbein and Ajzen, Belief, Attitude, Intention and Behavior: An Introduction to Theory and Research, Addison-Wesley, 1975) and the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, Organ. Behav. Hum. Decis. Processes. 50 (1991) 179-211). However, in IS adoption models, the predictive power of attitudes for behavior as an endogenous variable has proven strong in some circumstances and weak in others (Bagozzi and Yi, Soc. Psychol. Q. 52 (1989) 266-279; Taylor and Todd, MIS Q. 19 (1995) 561-570). These inconsistencies resulted in an exclusion of the construct attitude from further modified versions of the TAM and other models explaining individual IS adoption and use. To better understand the prevalence of inconsistent attitude-behavior relationships in IS adoption models, this research follows social psychological research practices focusing on situational factors prone to result in insignificant attitude-behavior relationships. To test for the impact of these factors on the attitude-behavior relationship, the article raises the level of analysis to a higher level of abstraction. A scientometric literature review and a meta-analysis of 14 top IS journals from 1989 to 2014 finds that three out of four situational factors positively influence the attitude-behavior relationship in the IS fields: voluntariness, technology type, and adoption context. These factors constitute ""the attitude cube"", which provides conceptual guidance for researchers in assessing the conditions under which the attitude-behavior relationship is likely to be weak or strong. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Product design and production were performed with minimal input from consumers, and the role of the consumer was witnessed only at the end of the product development process. Co-creation is generally considered by innovative firms that seek to achieve or maintain strategic competitiveness in the marketplace as a highly valuable progression in open innovation. Although extensive research results exist on innovation co-creation between firms and consumers, a coherent understanding of the application of such co-creation in mobile environments is missing in the literature. We consider opportunities that mobile technologies introduce to further develop co-creation. Based on an extensive literature review of innovation co-creation processes and ecosystems, we identify the key problems, issues, and requirements. We then develop an innovation co-creation framework with two levels of abstraction to organize the enablers, capabilities, and characteristics. We then suggest a roadmap with four stages for realizing a mobile innovation co-creation ecosystem. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Innovation co-creation; Mobile devices"

Two major information types, visual and textual information, govern the modalities of consumers in acquiring product-related information from most online product presentations. Previous studies have debated on which of these two information types can enhance the shopping performance of consumers. However, these debates have resulted in dichotomous outcomes. In this regard, the factor(s) that contribute to such divided results must be examined. In this study, we use the level of processing theory and information load to examine the effect of online product presentations on the online shopping performance of consumers. A laboratory experiment has also been conducted. The results of data analysis show that information load has a significant moderating role on the effects of online product presentations. The experimental results show that visual-based online product presentation has a greater effect on the shopping performance of consumers in high information load condition, whereas textual-based online product presentation provides greater performance advantages in low information load condition.

Perceived playfulness is derived from the user's subjective evaluation of their interaction with technology and is represented through the subdimensions: concentration, enjoyment, and curiosity. Results show that there is a positive association between perceived playfulness and their attitude toward using the technology. However, the existing studies do not provide a clear direction about conceptualizing and measuring the subdimensions of perceived playfulness. The lack of conclusive evidence, despite the IS literature, shows the need for more empirical studies investigating the actual effect of the distinct subdimensions of perceived playfulness across various contexts. This study develops a context-specific model by decomposing playfulness to completely identify the extent to which specific dimensions are influencing the user's attitude and further clarify their relative importance. An empirical study was conducted with a total sample size of 551 participants, from two different types of SNSs, to test the context-specific model. The results showed that the relative importance of the subdimensions is significantly different between the two SNSs.

Sales of mobile applications are a key revenue source in this economy, with the expected worldwide market growth of US $75 billion by 2017. Despite the trend, many mobile Apps fail to attract customers, yet there has been a lack of research and understanding of the factors that affect the decisions to buy them. This study is thus motivated to examine the factors that people consider in their buying decisions of mobile Apps for their smartphones. This mixed-methods investigation first adopts an exploratory and qualitative approach to identify the purchase decision factors based on interviews with consumers. It then undertakes a quantitative, confirmatory study using a survey to test the model derived using mental accounting theory and the findings of the exploratory study. The results show the direct and indirect effects of five factors – word of mouth about App, App usefulness, monetary value of App, App trialability, and App enjoyment – on the intention to purchase an App. In this manner, this study advances our understanding of the decision-making factors leading to the purchase of mobile Apps.

Little is known, however, about how individuals cope with these events. This paper examines these events by using a multi-method pragmatic approach informed by coping theory. The results of two studies – a critical incident study and an experiment – serve to build and test, respectively, a theoretical model that posits that individuals use a variety of strategies when dealing with these events: they experience negative emotions, make external attributions, and adopt engagement coping strategies directed at solving the event, eventually switching to a disengagement coping strategy when they feel they have no control over the situation. Furthermore, users’ efforts may result in ‘accidental’ learning as they try to overcome the discrepant IT events through engagement coping.

Contrary to the common belief that SNS users are committed to using one SNS, anecdotal evidence suggests that most users use multiple SNSs simultaneously. This study attempts to understand this phenomenon of users’ multi-homing on SNSs. Building upon optimum stimulation level (OSL) theory, uses and gratifications theory, and literature on choice complementarity, a theoretical model for investigating SNS users’ multi-homing intention is proposed. An analysis of survey data collected from 383 SNS users shows that OSL positively affects users’ perceived complementarity between different SNSs in gratifying their four facets of needs, namely, interpersonal communication, self-presentation, information, and entertainment. Among the four dimensions of perceived complementarity, only interpersonal communication and information aspects significantly affect users’ intention to multi-home on SNSs.

Many online business exchanges require the disclosure of sensitive personal information on a regular basis. Simultaneously, customers are reluctant to disclose private information online due to concerns about privacy. Thus, trust plays a critical role in such disclosures. However, a number of factors could influence the extent of customers' trust and their willingness to disclose their private information. In this study, we explore the critical roles of two sets of factors: the sensitivity of the context within which the private information is disclosed and the customer's personality. Our theory building is based on the contextualization of the theory of reasoned action (TRA-Privacy) and its synthesis with Prospect theory. Our theory argues that context sensitivity as a moderator and individuals' salient attributes in terms of personality types and privacy concern are critical factors impacting trust and the willingness to disclose personal information. Our results indicate that context moderates the parameters and path structure of the trust model and that the influence of personality on privacy concern and trust depends on the nature of the context. Applying these ""who"" and ""where"" aspects of theory building, the study opens a new avenue of context-related research that can further increase the specificity and richness of trust and privacy research. The study also provides a new perspective in trust scholarship, therein requiring the examination of three inter-related components: trustee, trustor and the context of trust. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Not only do the rapid technological changes increase the risks of companies’ investments into mobile technologies, but many such applications have also failed to gain user acceptance. In contrast to the consumer domain, there are very few empirical studies of mobile applications’ effectiveness from the perspectives of professional end users. Furthermore, designing mobile business applications has become an increasingly iterative and incremental activity, and ex post evaluations by actual users can provide crucial feedback to an iterative design process. In this study, we seek to contribute to establishing a design cycle that closely links the building and the evaluation of mobile business applications. Our objectives are to (1) gain a better understanding of mobile business applications’ success by means of ex post evaluations from end users, and to (2) leverage these empirical insights to inform the design of mobile business applications. We conducted the study in collaboration with DEKRA Automotive, which offers expert services in the automotive sector with experience in mobile business applications. Our primary contribution is a systematic approach to using ex post evaluation as input for the iterative design of mobile business applications. We suggest an adapted version of the D&M information system (IS) Success Model, which has process quality as an additional construct, as a basis for ex post evaluations of a mobile business application by its end users. Furthermore, we illustrate how a performance-based analysis of the empirical results enables one to derive priorities and recommendations for future design iterations. Our results reveal that system quality and process quality are the main determinants of individual benefits of using mobile business applications. Our findings thus contradict other studies that identify information quality as a significant motivator of (consumer-oriented) mobile data services. We conclude that a mobile business application's design should focus on process quality, emphasizing functional support for operational tasks in a specific work context while ensuring system quality, which is largely affected by technology platform choices. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Automotive industry; IS adoption; IS success; Mobile business applications; Mobile services; Service and maintenance processes"

We examine the effects of both organizational and individual factors on individuals' computer abuse intent. A theoretical model is developed based on two theories: abuse opportunity structure and emotion process. We empirically tested the model with 205 working professionals. We found that the abuse opportunity structure in organizations affects an individual's goal conduciveness, which in turn affects their abuse-positive affect. We also found that morality affects the abuse-positive affect, which in turn mediates the relationship between morality and abuse intent. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

User resistance may be overcome through the application of organizational controls. Control theory explains how users' actions and practices are shaped in line with organizational guidelines and procedures. This paper reports on a qualitative case study and shows how formal control mechanisms (behavior and outcome controls) can have a positive and conclusive impact on IS diffusion. The paper makes three contributions to knowledge. First, it explains how the application of outcome control mechanisms can lead to IS diffusion despite user resistance. Second, it suggests that IS diffusion paths are iterative rather than smooth and linear. Finally, the paper demonstrates that in some contexts, despite a lack of reward expectancy, sanction expectancy can be an effective force during the IS diffusion process. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To explore the possible relationship, we analyze two sets of international-level indexes: (1) the indexes of five of the societal cultural practices of the GLOBE project [35]; and (2) the e-government development and participation indexes from the most recent United Nations e-government survey [71]. Because economic development reportedly plays an important role in both e-government diffusion and cultural dynamics, we also examine the relationships between GNI per capita, culture, and e-government diffusion. A sample of 55 countries was studied. We find that culture does have an effect on e-government diffusion in various ways, and that economic development in the form of GNI per capita has a moderating effect on the relationship between culture and e-government diffusion. We discuss the implications of these findings for e-government strategy. In addition, we identify the limitations of the study and propose areas for future research.

A conceptual framework is developed to enhance understanding of technology diffusion by taking into account the dynamic interplay between rhetorical practice and technological frame.

From the perspective of transaction cost economics (TCE), this study identifies three context-specific TCE factors, i.e., unpredictability, trust, and personalization specificity, that can directly affect consumer revisit intention. Moreover, the proposed direct effects are arguably contingent upon the type of consumers (from direct versus indirect visiting channels). Our research model is empirically validated via an online survey. The results support the hypotheses that unpredictability and trust significantly influence consumers' revisit intentions. In addition, the results indicate that the visiting channel moderates the effects of the transaction cost factors. Specifically, unpredictability has stronger negative effects on revisit intention for indirect visitors, while the positive effects of personalization and trust are stronger for direct visitors. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we propose simplicity and interactivity as the key determinants of mobile phone usability and assess their significance in an empirical setting. Furthermore, we examine the effects of mobile phone usability on user satisfaction, trust, and brand loyalty and provide a holistic view of the causal relationships between the proposed UI features and important organizational variables for building and maintaining long-term customer relationships. The study was conducted using survey questionnaire data collected from 310 mobile phone users in South Korea. The findings of the study confirm that simplicity and interactivity are two significant determinants of mobile phone usability and that interface simplicity is an important precondition for positive interactivity and usability experience. Our findings also show that usability is a distal determinant of brand loyalty, exerting its influence indirectly through the mediators of satisfaction and trust.

We find that while exploitative organizational learning is generally correlated with outcomes, the explorative use of EMR is only important to clinicians, and not administrators, in hospitals. Furthermore, combined explorative and exploitative learning does not enhance user benefits, signaling that ambidexterity in EMR is not a significant factor in achieving desirable outcomes.

Based on the extant technology acceptance model (TAM), we proposed an extended TAM and conducted a large-scale survey among organizational workers who use MES in their workplace across industries. Our findings suggest that both positive attitude toward MES and a high level of habitual MES usage are positively associated with perceived job performance, and that task characteristics positively moderate the relationship between habitual usage (attitude toward MES) and perceived job performance. More importantly, we also found that organizational agility is positively associated with both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, while location independence is positively associated with perceived ease of use.

Factors such as shared goals, social relational embeddedness, and influence strategy are investigated to determine whether they act as major driving forces to develop inter-organizational trust among the various supply chain members. The survey is based on 226 managers located in major industrial parks in Taiwan; the results suggest that trust is enforced when organizations develop shared goals, form social relational embeddedness, and initiate influence strategies.

LGAs that plan to adopt such IntTech may consider this as a serious investment. Advocates, however, claim that such IntTech have emerged to overcome the integration problems at all levels (e.g. data, object and process). With the emergence of electronic government (e-Government), LGAs have turned to IntTech to fully automate and offer their services on-line and integrate their IT infrastructures. While earlier research on the adoption of IntTech has considered several factors (e.g. pressure, technological, support, and financial), inadequate attention and resources have been applied in systematically investigating the individual, decision and organisational context factors, influencing top management's decisions for adopting IntTech in LGAs. It is a highly considered phenomenon that the success of an organisation's operations relies heavily on understanding an individual's attitudes and behaviours, the surrounding context and the type of decisions taken. Based on empirical evidence gathered through two intensive case studies, this paper attempts to investigate the factors that influence decision makers while adopting IntTech. The findings illustrate two different doctrines - one inclined and receptive towards taking risky decisions, the other disinclined.

The first utilizes an algorithm to 'measure' the quality of knowledge contributions and ranks them accordingly, while the second averages the ratings that knowledge items receive from KMS users. Building on appraisal theory, we found that knowledge seekers and contributors reacted differently to the two mechanisms. The rating-based rankings positively influenced knowledge seekers' tendency to access, comment on, and spread the knowledge shared in the KMS, while the algorithm-based ranking positively influenced knowledge contributors' to continue sharing knowledge via the system.

Indeed, the mechanisms serve as full mediators for this ability, thus accentuating their value for knowledge, information technology, and innovation management. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

CRM systems are categorized as collaborative, operational and analytical. An analysis of CRM applications in three organizations reveals that analytical systems strongly support the combination process. Collaborative systems provide the greatest support for externalization. Operational systems facilitate socialization with customers, while collaborative systems are used for socialization within an organization. Collaborative and analytical systems both support the internalization process by providing learning opportunities. Three-way interactions among CRM systems, types of customer knowledge, and knowledge creation processes are explored. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","CRM; Customer knowledge; Customer relationship management; Knowledge creation; Organizational knowledge creation theory"

To address such problems, the literature suggests the implementation of a Total Data Quality Management Program (TDQM) that should consist of the following phases: DQ definition, measurement, analysis and improvement. As such, this paper performs an empirical study using a questionnaire that was distributed to financial institutions worldwide to identify the most important DQ dimensions, to assess the DQ level of credit risk databases using the identified DQ dimensions, to analyze DQ issues and to suggest improvement actions in a credit risk assessment context. This questionnaire is structured according to the framework of Wang and Strong and incorporates three additional DQ dimensions that were found to be important to the current context (i.e., actionable, alignment and traceable). Additionally, this paper contributes to the literature by developing a scorecard index to assess the DQ level of credit risk databases using the DQ dimensions that were identified as most important.

The process of achieving a goal can be represented as interlinked means-end chains of user goals that have been traditionally visualized as hierarchies. Evidence in recent literature suggests that a network structure would be more appropriate and provide insight into a user's process of seeking a goal. We investigated user goal means-end chains for the eBay online auction system, and produced its structure as a goal network. To analyze this network and assess the importance of various goals, social network analysis measures were used (specifically, degree and flow-betweenness centrality). In addition, goal networks for users with low and high IS value were created and differences in goal importance in the two groups were considered. Results revealed that the most important user goals are closely related to key features of the auction system; users with high IS value want to use eBay to buy, sell, and bid for products, while users with low IS value seem to avoid using eBay because of uncertain price bidding. As such, the results of our study suggest that differences in IS value may be due to differences in IS usage.

However, just achieving and maintaining their skills is not sufficient; they must contribute to the project in a meaningful fashion, including their supportive activity: organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). However, IS personnel have different motivational factors, informal behavior patterns, and exhibit OCBs different from those in other fields. In addition, projects present a different face than operations in an organization and alter the context of OCBs. This combination leads to a unique setting where the perceptions of equity by IS employees in project teams are unlikely to follow patterns established for functional operations. To determine if perceived equity can lead to desirable attitudes and behavior in this novel setting, we surveyed IS team members of development projects. Data from 298 respondents in 47 project teams indicated that equity, as measured by perceptions of justice, add to job commitment, which serves as a mediator between the justices and OCBs.

Unfortunately, organisations have many different requirements related to data quality (DQ) assessment. For example, some organisations may need to focus on ensuring regulations are met rather than reducing costs. Due to this, organisations may be forced to follow an assessment technique, which may not wholly fit their needs and current situation. Therefore, we propose and evaluate the Hybrid Approach to assessing DQ, which demonstrates how to dynamically configure an assessment technique as needed while leveraging the best practices from existing assessment techniques. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Approach; Assessment techniques; Data quality; Data quality assessment; Hybrid; Information quality; Information quality assessment"

As investment in these systems is steadily increasing in a wide range of industries, it is important to understand their economic effect. Under BI, information can be accessed in a timelier manner, decisions become increasingly data driven, and reports become more informative. This, in turn, can lead to more consistent company behavior and performance. We therefore hypothesized that BI systems could help reduce the company's stock return volatility. To test this hypothesis, we empirically analyzed a large sample of firms that had deployed a BI system. Our results indicated a significant reduction in stock return volatility subsequent to BI deployment. The reduction in volatility is of similar magnitude whether the BI system is implemented to serve upper or middle management, or the knowledge workforce. Overall, the results suggested that BI systems reduce the financial risk of an organization. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Business Intelligence; Decision support; Event study; Information availability; Volatility"

Program managers must be able to manage the interfaces of multiple interdependent projects to realize the goals of an IT implementation. However, the common problems of conflict and poor coordination often hinder the achievement of a program's goals. Part of this difficulty may lie in the structuring of the program goals themselves. Guided by Strategic Consensus Theory (SCT) and Realistic Group Conflict Theory (RGCT), we examine three enterprise system programs to study the relationship between the shared understanding of multiple or single program goals and conflict resolution and the coordination of programs in an attempt to explain a program's successful implementation. We find that a shared goal understanding as suggested by SCT is not sufficient to facilitate essential coordination. However, a superordinate goal as suggested by RGCT appears to resolve any discrepancies. The results imply that goals should be structured as superordinate requirements. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Conflict resolution; Enterprise system implementation; Program management; Realistic group conflict; Strategic goal consensus"

Due to uncertainty or change in the client environment, the fit between capabilities and organizational structure of outsourcing providers must be balanced. Here we present the results of an exploratory quantitative empirical study among outsourcing experts involved with three different types of IT outsourcing providers: domestic, offshore, and global. We developed instruments that measured some core concepts such as outsourcing capabilities, organizational structure dimensions, and performance monitoring. We then used these in analyzing data gathered from three different types of IT outsourcing providers. We found that service providers who establish a fit between their outsourcing capabilities and their customers' organizational structures are less susceptible to problems resulting from unexpected change in the clients' environment.

To explore this research agenda, we examine the effects of social media on established and emerging flows of rhetorical practices in organizations, focusing in particular on the expanding, and in some cases switching, roles played by senior management and employees. We conceptualize organizational rhetorical practices as the combination of strategic intent, message and media, and discuss the interplay between rhetors and their audience. Adopting an interpretive, multiple case study approach, we study the use of social media in three multi-national organizations in the telecommunications industry.

To address this gap, we developed a model that explains the effects of neutralization techniques on software piracy intention. We included different types of deterrents (formal sanctions, shame, and moral belief) in our model because individuals may use neutralization techniques to mitigate feelings of guilt and shame, which, subsequently, reduce the deterrent effect. Our empirical results (for 183 people surveyed) showed that appeal to higher loyalties and condemn the condemners strongly predict software piracy intentions. In addition, informal deterrents such as shame and moral beliefs are strong predictors. These findings suggest that anti-piracy efforts should involve educational intervention aimed at addressing these two neutralization techniques rather than relying on formal sanctions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Deterrence; Illegal copying of software; Neutralization techniques; Software piracy"

A multiple contingency model of KM strategy is then developed based on a technology-organization- environment framework. This study proposes that the effectiveness of each KM strategy depends on both external and internal contextual conditions, namely, environmental knowledge intensity and organizational information systems (IS) maturity. To test and validate the contingency model, we analyze data from 141 firms to explain the effects of KM strategies on KM performance.

Many organizations have been hesitant about their use of virtual environments for this reason. Virtual worlds (VWs) have received attention as environments for learning, yet little is known about their attributes, or how they affect learning in collaborative tasks. James Gibson proposed a theory of affordance to explain how cues in an environment are perceived and lead to some course of action. Based on his theory, we developed a model to describe how cues of what can be done in a VW influence learning. In doing so, we focused on the situativity afforded by VWs through context and social facilitation. We showed how VW artifacts and cues make it easier for users to understand the conditions and interactions in a VW. We used this as a basis for predicting a user's mental state and its impact on perceived learning, learning satisfaction, and task participation. We tested our model in a lab experiment set in a VW, using a task that required collaboration between subjects. Our results supported our proposed model.

However, we are unsure of the bidders strategies and their effectiveness in achieving auction goals. Our study was an attempt to identify bidding strategies empirically in online single-unit auctions and evaluate their outcome in terms of cost saving, perceived bidder enjoyment, and bidder satisfaction. A research model was developed and used to examine the relationships. Both objective and subjective data of online single-unit auctions were collected from Taobao.com to validate our postulated hypotheses. We found three main bidding strategies: early, snipe, and agent-supported ratchet bidding based on their behavior patterns. These resulted in different levels of winning outcome and cost saving, but had no significant effect on perceived enjoyment. The hypotheses of the relationship between auction outcomes and bidder satisfaction of their bidding strategies were confirmed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Bidding strategy; Online auction e-Auction; Satisfaction; Single-unit auction"

However, we know very little of this phenomenon or the key drivers of user switching. We examined the reasons for IT switching by proposing a model that synthesized and extended current theories of IT acceptance and customer satisfaction. We believed that IT switching was driven by user dissatisfaction with an incumbent product or service and the fact that the customer was aware of the availability of a potentially superior product or service. Further, to explain differential switching patterns across an adopter population, we posited personal innovativeness as an individual difference variable that moderated the effect of user dissatisfaction and relative advantage of a new IT on users' switching intention. Our model was empirically validated using a longitudinal survey of web browser switching among student subjects. We hope that our study will generate researchers' interest in an understudied area of research and that the model will serve as a starting point for furthering our understanding of IT switching. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Acceptance; Continuance; Information technology usage; Longitudinal survey; Switching"

Analysis of data collected from two informants (the IS manager and a business-unit counterpart) in a sample of manufacturing firms showed that perceived business-unit trustworthiness was significantly more important in fostering shared business-IS understanding than perceived IS-unit trustworthiness. We attributed this to the inherent power asymmetry that characterizes the relationship between IS and business units.

Three supplier selection criteria (international market position, training support by the supplier and supplier technical support and experience) had a significant influence on supplier service quality, and two consultant selection criteria (consultant's ERP implementation experience in a similar industry and consultant's support after going live) were related to consultant service quality.

Our study also suggested that enhanced system quality and service quality could increase user perspective and ERP success. © 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Balanced scorecard; ERP consultants; ERP suppliers; ERP systems; Path analysis; Selection criteria; SERVQUAL; System quality"

Adopting social identification and relationship marketing perspectives, we examined the positive and negative aspects of online community cultivation and tested the meditating mechanisms involved in member participation processes. A survey-based study, conducted with 913 online consumers, revealed that community interaction can lead to consumer power through community identification and relationship investments. Furthermore, we found that perceived e-tailer support negatively affected the relationship between identification and consumer power. We concluded with a discussion of the key managerial and research implications of our findings. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Community identification; Community participation; Consumer power; Loyalty; Relationship investments"

Product and seller quality are communicated through website signals. Using signaling theory, we developed a three-dimensional framework to classify website signals. We empirically tested the framework with a comparative content analysis of websites from a sample of online pharmacies. We found that low-quality sellers were likely to avoid costly and easy-to-verify signals and used fewer signals than did high-quality sellers, who used costly and difficult-to-verify signals and displayed more signals. These results provide information to online buyers and regulatory institutions in charge of online retailer evaluation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Adverse selection; Information asymmetry; Moral hazard; Signaling theory; Website signals"

Most current information-sharing studies address the benefits gained from shared data, but neglect the effect of willingness to share, in which the benefits of sharing data may be discounted. This study looks into the factors that affect the extent of the willingness of companies to share information from a partnership-data-process perspective. To distinguish the mode of sharing, we differentiate information sharing into template based and proactive. Our results suggest that when partnerships become closer, the willingness to share template-based information increases and consequently the willingness to proactively share additional information. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Computer-mediated communication and collaboration; Inter-organizational information system; IT-enabled supply chains; Questionnaire surveys"

Numerous benefits might be gained if SMEs could utilize evaluation models to help select their IT/IS outsourcer effectively. Prejudices arising from selection through impartial analysis could be avoided and a more accurate and an objective decision could be made. We investigated the selection process of an enterprise needing an IT/IS outsourcing provider in Taiwan. Our recommended process quantitatively sorts the criteria using the AHP. An evaluation model was developed based on the needs of the SME who should use it to obtain a better outsourcing provider resulting from improved information vital to maintain outsourcing efficiency. Use of our model should reduce costs and potential risks in adopting new IT/IS applications and promote an objective standard with which to evaluate IT/IS outsourcing providers. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Analytic Hierarchy Process; Delphi method; IT/IS outsourcing; Outsourcing provider selection model; Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)"

We specifically decomposed the leadership and motivation construct to understand the hidden mechanisms by which leadership impacts motivation. A set of survey data collected from 118 OSS developers on Sourceforge.net was used to test our hypotheses.

A number of socio-cognitive theories have been used to explain this. However, prior studies have not examined the influence of past and automatic behavior on employee decisions to comply. This is an important omission because past behavior has been assumed to strongly affect decision-making. To address this gap, we integrated habit (a routinized form of past behavior) with Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), to explain compliance. An empirical test showed that habitual IS security compliance strongly reinforced the cognitive processes theorized by PMT, as well as employee intention for future compliance. We also found that nearly all components of PMT significantly impacted employee intention to comply with IS security policies. Together, these results highlighted the importance of addressing employees' past and automatic behavior in order to improve compliance. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Habit theory; Information security; Information security policy compliance; Protection Motivation Theory; Scenario methodology"

As part of our exploratory study, a longitudinal survey, involving constant observation, development and use of questionnaires and qualitative interviews with managers of seven firms were conducted. We selected the firms so they covered a wide range of KM maturity levels; triangulation was adopted to enhance the quality of the process.
