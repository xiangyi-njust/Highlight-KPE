With the increasing availability of a large quantity of information, traditional tools and practices without wasting time and cost cannot respond to users accurately and quickly. The present study aims to analyze book circulation transactions and discover the user's book loan patterns to develop a recommender system. The data included 109,639 transactions and information from 8636 user records. Microsoft SQL Server and Matlab software were applied to analyze the data. Item-based collaborative filtering algorithms and decision tree methods were also applied. The results led to the extraction of rules for suggesting books to users. Analysis of the circulation data could be applied to address many issues like evaluation, collection acquisition policies, allocating funding for materials, and suggesting approaches to deselecting and allocating physical space for materials. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Academic library; Association rule; Collaborative filtering algorithm; Data mining; Information resource circulation; Recommendation system; User access pattern"
"Are public libraries efficient? Evaluating scale economies of public libraries in the U.S. with a cost function approach","2023","Library and Information Science Research","10.1016/j.lisr.2023.101271","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176783815&doi=10.1016%2fj.lisr.2023.101271&partnerID=40&md5=4992ce4166aeae5db4548e6348976ba6","Public libraries are important informational, cultural, social, and educational institutions. Although the research has shown their significant presence, value, and effectiveness in providing services for their communities, there is the persistent questioning of value and efficiency of public libraries by some, which leads to continuous and severe funding cuts for public libraries. This study addresses the efficiency issue of public libraries. The previous research on this issue is inconclusive because of deficiencies in methodologies, such as the use of circulation as the single measure for library outputs while ignoring all other library services. This study applies a well-established cost function with multiple output measures to over 1600 public libraries in the United States. This study concludes that public libraries as a whole operate efficiently and argues for sustained and continuous funding for public libraries. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Budget; Cost function; Efficiency; Funding; Information services; Library costs; Public libraries; Scale economies; United States; Value"

The problem this study addresses is the lack of understanding of what tasks STEM liaison librarians do and how often. STEM liaison librarians from a sampling frame of 135 at 16 similarly Association of Research Libraries were surveyed with demographic and job analysis questions. A total of 41 participants completed the entirety of the survey. Findings indicate the majority of respondents serve 4 or more departments and continue to spend a majority of their time on traditional liaison tasks, but data-related duties are in greater demand. In these continually uncertain times with dwindling resources in academic libraries, a clearer picture of STEM liaison librarian tasks and the duration expended on each helps inform staffing of services. A better understanding of these duties and their frequency will add value to more accurate job descriptions, relevant curriculum, and training, as well as advance the understanding of what these information professionals do with their work time as well as tell us what they no longer do as much. © 2023","Academic libraries; Collection development; Engagement; Instruction services; Job analyses; Liaison librarian; Outreach; Research data; Research support; Science librarian; Survey"

It aims to form willful relationships between scientists to achieve the shared objective of new information creation with the end goal of knowledge production. Findings of an exploratory study investigating barriers that hinder effective scientific collaboration and strategies to cope with these obstacles are reported. A qualitative and interpretive methodology is leveraged to analyze data collected from 14 in-depth interviews with researchers who work in a cross-disciplinary scientific research center. The results indicate that domain disparity and motivation and engagement are the strongest hindrances to effective collaboration. Researchers adopt active and constant learning as an approach to mitigate barriers, lower affective distress, and improve collaboration processes.

A good way of optimizing resource allocation is the regular evaluation of suppliers to select resources. E-book resources were used as the starting point to examine the method of supplier evaluation within the concept of “smart library” using an analytic hierarchical process to integrate and weight perspectives from e-vendors, academics, and professional librarians. Findings demonstrate that both traditional and “smart” factors impact the final evaluation of e-book suppliers. In addition, the influence of smart service factors on the efficacy of library innovation can be evaluated by the linear regression method. Two systematic methods in the assessment of e-book suppliers were outlined and the concept of “smart factors” based on traditional indicators for application in constructing digital book resources was introduced. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","AHP analysis; E-book platform; OLS analysis; Smart library; Vendor evaluation"

Moreover, news posted on social media usually includes images, but little is known about the role of such images in shaping user decisions to share negative news. To fill this gap, the humans' affective–cognitive model of information processing (HACIP) was developed to explore the effects of images on the sharing of negative news and to investigate the contingent role of images in the sharing decision. To test the model and hypotheses, a scenario-based online experiment was conducted, which yielded 285 valid responses. Analysis results indicate that images in negative news induce users' negative emotion and arousal, which influence their sharing decision. Further, the presence of images strengthens the effect of negative emotion and weakens the effect of information uniqueness. Thus, this study contributes to the literature by identifying the distinct role of images in information processing and by proposing a brand-new framework to explore user sharing of negative news. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Arousal; Image; Information uniqueness; Negative emotion; Negative news; Sharing decision"

Using ethnographic field data collection and analysis, the role that the in-person collection day event plays in the construction of communities of records and memory in participatory archives was examined. Analysis of ethnographic observation data and semi-structured interviews shows that for participants, a sense of connection to community and to the archives is dependent on the collection day being an in-person outreach event. Findings also show that the event design can make some participants feel welcome while excluding others, possibly limiting the reach of the archives to diverse communities. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Archival studies; Collection day events; Community outreach; Ethnographic research methods; Participatory archives"

The authors provide a critique of this call based in primary research on public libraries in the state of New Jersey during the COVID-19 pandemic. To compliment reviews of public library websites across the state of New Jersey for listed tactics to address misinformation, library staff were surveyed and interviewed on strategies they employ to stem the tide of misinformation and what they might need to work more effectively in the context. The findings reveal tactics employed by the libraries, ranging from active to passive interventions, and literacy-driven to topic-driven tactics, as well as what library staff articulated as impediments to their ability to address misinformation, including the lack of resources, the perception that the library should be a neutral arbiter in these discussions, and that they are “speaking to the choir” with their efforts. The findings can be useful in evaluating existing methods of addressing misinformation within public libraries and developing new tactics and partnerships that can be leveraged to achieve these goals. © 2022","Critical library and information studies; Misinformation; Mixed qualitative methods; New Jersey; Programming; Public libraries"

The fuzzy delphi method was employed to validate the factors and indicators derived from the literature review. Hardware, policy, management support, organizational structure, situation awareness, training, and funder policy are all factors that reached the expert consensus. Strategy is a factor that included two indicators that did not reach expert consensus. The final result of the analysis indicates that the proposed readiness model should include 13 factors with 32 indicators.

An eye-tracking study with 30 participants was carried out using two digital libraries. Analysis of the questionnaires revealed that overall, one digital library was experienced more positively, with the difference most evident in the hedonic quality. The eye-tracking data revealed different gaze patterns in the two digital libraries, with significant difference in measure values particularly on the search boxes.

Drawn from Ruthven's research methodology, gender differences between conscious and formalized information needs using 4000 postings to four major online discussion topics were analyzed. Descriptive statistical analysis was based on text length and vocabulary usage. The analysis confirmed Ruthven's conclusion in the Chinese context that the statements describing conscious information needs are more narrative with more emotional and sensitive words. Females, on the other hand, frequently express their information needs consciously. Problematic situations generate information needs. Consequently, understanding the information needs levels should consider additional contextual aspects, and the initial stages of information needs are essentially the awareness in problematic situations. Language and gender distinction in the Chinese context is mainly helpful to refine the concept of information need levels and can also be an extension of Ruthven's research. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Gender differences; Ian Ruthven; Information needs; Language distinctions; Levels of information needs; Online Q&A communities; Robert Joseph Taylor"

It is crucial to consider spatial accessibility's impacts on equity and inclusiveness of public libraries. A method is proposed to evaluate the equity of spatial accessibility to library resources and services across population groups. Spatial accessibility is measured in two ways: the closest-based and quantity-based measurements that respectively characterize the level of accessibility to the closest one and to diverse resources according to travel distance and travel time in road networks. Two approaches are applied for equity evaluation with socioeconomic and demographic indicators of census tracts, including the minority population, non-adults, and population in poverty. The method is applied to examine the physical locations of public libraries in four major cities of the U.S with diverse population composition. Results show spatial inequity for socially disadvantaged populations in the cities of Washington DC, Baltimore, and Chicago. Inequity is more prominent for non-adults and minority populations in DC and Baltimore.

While digitalization of public libraries already attracted significant scholarly attention, the evidence of its contribution to the acquisition of cultural skills and knowledge and social mobility remains limited, as does the conceptual understanding of links between digitalization, cultural capital, and social stratification. This article draws on two disconnected bodies of research, the sociological analysis of cultural capital and stratification and research on digital divides. To bridge these two bodies of research, the interplay of cultural and digital capital in public libraries was investigated. The extensive dataset from the UK Taking Part Survey (2016–17) was analyzed using two-step cluster analysis and multinomial regression models to explore the contrasting profiles of contemporary library users. Results identify four distinct user groups: Traditional, Active, Family, and Tech Access, which possess different degrees of cultural and digital capital, have different demographic profiles, and benefit from digitalized libraries in different ways. If libraries are to fulfil their role in reducing social inequalities, it is important that they tailor their digital services to the specific characteristics of each user group. This approach also provides a useful template for exploring the interplay of digitalization and (in)equality in other cultural institutions. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Cultural capital; Digital capital; Digital divide; Internet; Public libraries"

The results show that librarians' level of interest and awareness of the privacy of library users in 2019 is significantly higher than that of 2013; awareness of the danger in collection of user data increased significantly after education; and finally, after education, there was greater receptivity to the education courses and willingness to recommend them to their colleagues. In order to increase awareness of privacy violations and for greater protection of library user privacy libraries and professional associations must strive to provide standardized and regular privacy education for librarians and library staff. © 2020",""

The Play-and-Learn Spaces project married developmental science with the changing nature of 21st century libraries. The study asked if it is possible to augment learning in informal spaces using the built environment to encourage discourse and interaction. For this project, the library space was reconstructed such that a corner became a climbing wall on which children could create words by following varied paths up the wall's letter-filled surface. Seating was transformed into large movable “Tangram”-type pieces and a stage, complete with magnetic words, invited children to create stories on the wall and complete story-related activities through socio-dramatic play. Using naturalistic observation, results demonstrated that the use of the Play-and-Learn spaces was associated with increases in the kinds of caregiver and child conversation and interaction known to support language, literacy and STEM skills.

Interviews including 20 librarians from 19 different institutions were conducted to collect data about their decision-making processes when purchasing e-book products. Institutional theory was used as a framework to analyze interview data. Librarians' perceptions of the environment where their decision process occurred were described as full of uncertainty, with the e-book market viewed as non-competitive with limited alternative products. Seven strategies the interviewees adopted to justify their purchase decisions were then identified, including experimentation, incorporating users' input, reliance on written documents, learning from past experiences, learning from other libraries, group decision, and aggressive negotiation. Decision-making processes were a mixture of institutional and rational actions. Factors affecting rationality in librarians' e-book purchase decisions could be applied to other types of decision-making in library settings, allowing stakeholders to better understand and interpret the situations that either help or hinder the rationality in library's decision-making. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",""

Social media platforms enable the rapid spread of such misinformation and also make evaluating the credibility of online information more difficult. Since college students are frequent users of social media, they are particularly likely to be exposed to fake news. A survey was conducted with 63 undergraduate students in which they identified and evaluated examples of both fake and real news stories and reported their associated information behaviors. Results showed correlations between accurate identification of fake news stories and specific critical evaluation behaviors and strategies. However, students were unable to accurately evaluate their own skills, and their willingness to share fake news stories on social media was not related to accurate identifications or evaluations of trustworthiness.

The latter, before taking any university IL courses, were found to be more successful in all subject areas of the test, which could inter alia indicate a positive influence of secondary education on IL. Both student groups were the weakest in information search, followed by information evaluation and knowledge of legal/ethical issues. Secondary school students were less aware of their deficient search skills. The item analysis emphasized the need to put more educational efforts and practical examples into the teaching of IL topics where both groups were found deficient. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",""

These contexts vary according to whether the search was professional or personal and successful or struggled. The impact of educational stage differs based on context. In some contexts, people at higher educational stages are more likely to attend to digital sources and less likely to attend to human sources. In other contexts, there is no statistically significant difference (p < 0.10) among educational stages. These findings provide support for previous V&R research, while also demonstrating that online surveys can be used to supplement and balance the data collected from semi-structured interviews. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Context of information need; Human sources; Information literacy; Misinformation; Online resources; Online survey"

The interview data revealed that except for health care providers, a spouse or partner was mentioned as a credible interpersonal source of health information among older adults in a marital or romantic relationship. Characteristics of older adults' health information behavior in the ELIS context were identified based on types of way of life and mastery of life. For example, those who had more varied types of hobbies, including cognitive, affective, and social hobbies, were exposed to diverse people as they performed their daily routine, potentially resulting in different sources of useful health information.

Survival analysis, a statistical method commonly used in clinical research and medical trials, was employed to predict the time-to-trigger for DDA purchases within the context of a large research university library. By predicting which e-books will be triggered (i.e., purchased), as well as the time to trigger occurrence, the method tested in this study provides libraries a deeper understanding of factors influencing their DDA purchasing patterns. This understanding will help libraries optimize their DDA profile management and DDA budgets.

This research posits that the how we done it good paradigm in librarianship reflects a valid and legitimate approach to research.

However, no prior research has investigated the value of public library services for children. Specifically, earlier studies evaluated the value of public libraries as a whole, without considering library services for different stakeholders. The fact that children are not autonomous economic agents is another problem to address. These barriers can be overcome by using the contingent valuation method with parents/caregivers as the subjects queried and children used as the objects in this study. Thus, the economic value of library services for children can be obtained to support managerial decisions on services specifically designed for children. More precisely, this study is unique in that it develops a contingent valuation methodology for estimating the value of children's library services based on adults' willingness to allocate a proportion of municipal budgets. Both users and non-users were surveyed to verify the proposed methodology empirically. The results show that the perceived effectiveness (ratio between perceived benefits and costs) of children's library services is 11.2 (11.2 units of benefits for each unit invested) in Czech public libraries compared with 4.3 for a library as a whole. This finding confirms the essential role of children's library services, implying that public libraries should offer a broader selection of children's books and other services. The study also shows that the value of children's library services depends on the age, education and economic structure of the adults queried. In addition, their satisfaction with library services is another important determinant, indicating that public libraries can influence the perceived benefits of children's library services. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",""

This study explores students' embodied experience of an information commons building. Data were gathered from participatory walking interviews, where students were asked to give the interviewer a guided tour of the building. Findings revealed the way that particular combinations of sensory experience contributed to particular forms of learning. Very small movements or choices seem to reconfigure space significantly. This research also draws attention to the way that different learning atmospheres are actively constructed. The findings contribute a new perspective on inquiry into the use of library space.

The primary goal of this study was to understand ELIS in the context of female university students' coping with daily hassles. To identify the dimensions and determinants of ELIS, and to fill this current gap in the literature, a grounded theory study was conducted using Flick's stages of episodic interviewing with 21 Iranian female first-year university students. Data were collected through semistructured interviews and analyzed through open, axial and selective coding. The findings showed that ELIS in coping with daily hassles is a multidimensional phenomenon that is affected by individuals' characteristics and sociocultural norms and values. Three main categories emerged as determinants of ELIS, namely normative status of the daily hassles, normative status of the information resources, and the individual's characteristics. Two main categories emerged as dimensions of ELIS which were type and strategy of action. Results of this study can contribute to the conceptual development of ELIS and may indicate how and in what circumstances ELIS dimensions emerge.

Twenty semi-structured interviews with 29 individuals who attended one of three Inspiring Ireland 1916 public collection days were conducted in order to explore participants' motivations for attending the event and perceived benefits. A participatory archives event, the collection days invited members of the public to bring relevant possessions to be digitally captured and have their story of the item recorded. The stories and items were then made available on the Inspiring Ireland website commemorating the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin, Ireland. While participatory initiatives have enjoyed increasing attention in the archives literature of late, much of this work attempts to define terms or model behaviours from the perspective of the archivists. Little existing work attempts to explore the motivations of individuals to participate in these events using empirical methods. Findings suggest motivations for attending a collection day can be characterised across four characteristics that can be categorised as aligning with individual or communal perception of benefits: A) to share their story and provide evidence in order to influence the contemporary narrative of the Rising (individual benefit), B) to relieve the burdens of preservation and remembering (individual benefit), C) to find out more about the object or context of the object (individual benefit), and D) to share their object via the open access features of the Inspiring Ireland website as a way to fulfil a civic duty and support a public good (communal benefit). These findings contradict existing literature about the purpose for engaging in participatory initiatives (to pluralise collections) and assumptions about why individuals are motivated to engage (altruistic, intrinsic motivation). Further exploration of the concept of communal versus individual perceived benefit could influence the ways in which cultural heritage institutions justify their role in society. The concept of an archival user is evolving. Understanding how participation can be considered use will help institutions develop a more holistic understanding of use in contemporary settings. © 2018",""

Autonomy support and perceived competence were found to explain 34.7% of the variance in autonomous motivation while autonomous motivation, in turn, explained 13.1% of variance in effort and 25.8% variance in enjoyment. The model indicates a positive relationship between basic psychological needs and autonomous motivation. Higher students’ autonomy support and perceived competence levels lead to increases in autonomous motivation to seek information. Higher autonomous motivation levels, similarly, lead to higher levels of effort and enjoyment. Findings confirm that intrinsically motivated students enjoy information seeking more and invest more effort in the activity.

The agent model for public libraries developed for this study demonstrates the possibilities for analyzing accessibility, exploring demographic data of potential users, finding underserved areas, and searching for the best locations or relocation sites for libraries. This model has been implemented and tested using the entire public library network of Slovenia. Results suggest that agent-based geographical modeling is a promising method for research in the field of library and information science. © 2020 The Authors",""

The model, developed from disaster and information seeking literature, attempts to predict information source and channel selection by people after their community has received a warning for a disaster. It provides the coding framework for analysis of 51 semi-structured interviews with disaster-affected Australians. The interviews tested the model for accommodation of channels and sources that people chose, found most useful, and used most in bushfire, slow flood, flash flood, and cyclone situations. The order of initial sources was investigated and preliminary information seeking pathways established across disaster types. The disaster information seeking model supports this investigation of information seeking behaviour, though improvements are suggested. The resulting model could guide agency response communication for different disaster types. © 2018",""

This hybrid strategy, historical case study, must analyze cases from the distant past to the present, using eclectic data sources, in order to produce both idiographic and nomothetic knowledge. To develop historical case study, the universal components of diachronic analysis are first identified. A general research design for historical case study is then introduced. Finally, historical case study is tested in an actual research project. Findings from this project reveal that historical case study is a successful diachronic research strategy.

The results of MI achieved are evaluated using a confidence interval and the bootstrap method. The productivity of main services of public libraries was studied for the year 2016 in comparison with the year 2012. On average, small as well as large libraries exhibit a statistically significant decline in productivity. The average value of the MI of small libraries is 1.29. The average value of the MI of large libraries is 1.16. The deterioration of productivity was caused by lower efficiency of the inputs. The small as well as the large libraries on average exhibit a comparable level of productivity in both studied years. This conclusion is the same for the Czech and for the Slovak libraries as well as for all libraries together. The Czech libraries, when compared with the Slovak ones, achieve better results in terms of productivity. The higher productivity of the Czech libraries in comparison with the Slovak ones is caused by the improvement of efficiency of the inputs, not by the technological changes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",""

Fear of exposure or surveillance could threaten an individual's inclination to search for and access information. Understandably then, privacy is understood to be a core professional responsibility of librarians. This study builds on a national report and a qualitative study, completed in the United States, which explored librarians’ attitudes on privacy. Adding a Canadian voice to the literature, this study examines survey results from academic librarians in Canada on their perceptions and attitudes related to library practices and online privacy behaviors. Overall, Canadian academic librarians believe that protecting patron privacy and educating patrons about issues related to online privacy is important. However, many Canadian academic librarians doubt that libraries are doing all they can to protect patron privacy. Academic librarians stand to gain knowledge and understanding of peer attitudes toward online privacy, as well as how patron privacy is being advocated for and protected on university campuses across Canada. The results will guide future library policies and programming aimed at creating an environment where privacy rights are protected and patrons can make informed choices about their online actions. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",""

The correlational research design, along with a multistage sampling procedure, was applied to select samples to reduce the sample to a manageable proportion. Professional librarians and library officers in four university libraries provided the data for the study. Results showed that e-Skill is the model's strongest determinant of technology acceptance intention among librarians. Also, PEOU will significantly moderate librarians' intention towards library technology acceptance when e-Skills are insufficient. From these outcomes, the understanding of the determinants of behavioural intention captured in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAT) is extended and refined. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",""

Data was collected from a sample of 235 faculty in six universities in Ghana using a questionnaire. Age, gender, rank and university of affiliation predicted personal information activities behaviors in different directions and with different magnitudes. Gender made a difference in information organization and information storage while age made a difference in respect of information creation and information organization only. Faculty ages 4049 years created information the most, followed by those above 50 years. Males stored information more than females. Rank made a difference in information creation, organization and storage, but university of affiliation made a difference in information creation and information storage, and not information organization. It is common among information system designers and managers to implement information management systems without considering the differential influence of personal variables on human information behaviors. This omission denies information users adequate access and maximum use of the information in their information space. Institutional leaders and PIM systems designers should consider demographic and other personal factors of faculty in information literacy programs. Profiling of users' personal characteristics when designing personal information management systems will enhance maximum access and utilisation of personal information. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",""

Defining success is the first step of the evaluation process yet proves difficult due to the heterogeneity of making participants and purposes and the individualized, self-directed nature of makerspace participation. This study identified and compared seven evaluative criteria that represented participants' and library definitions of success for one public library makerspace. Findings revealed that at least one criterion drawn from library objectives was relevant for each participant in the sample, yet none of the seven criteria was relevant for every participant. In an evaluation, drawing criteria exclusively from library objectives and/or applying criteria uniformly could underestimate the benefits of the makerspace. Drawing criteria from both library and participant perspectives and using individualized criteria that vary across the population could yield an assessment that reflects the breadth of purposes and benefits associated with the makerspace. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",""

With a qualitative and explorative approach, it was discovered that the servicescape has great influence on student users when the physical environment triggers certain responses and behaviours. Physical workspace discomfort and disturbance from other students, lead to negative cognitive perceptions, which in turn cause negative emotional responses that impact students' learning experiences. Students' behaviour and experience of the library facilities are also influenced by whether the library can accommodate their various needs throughout the study progression. Additionally, the purpose of library usage is much affected by the structure of the library and proximity to other social facilities. The findings also indicate that a workspace with effective and flexible seating solutions contribute to approach behaviour. As the model goes beyond the physical facilities alone, further understanding of various user responses triggered by the interplay between the built and social environment is gained. Such knowledge contributes to improve library facilities and for libraries to remain important as effective and relevant learning space. © 2020 The Author(s)","Academic libraries; Norway; Physical learning space; Servicescape; University students; User experiences and behaviours"

Using the unique spatial characteristics of a specific academic library, this study explores the wayfinding patterns of repeat users and evaluates the impact of patrons’ travel habits on their library space usage. The GIS tool ArcMap is employed to visualize library traffic and detect potential patterns of habitual wayfinding. The impact of habitual wayfinding behaviors on library space usage is analyzed. Findings suggest that travel habits formed through past frequent actions can lead to consistent navigation preferences toward certain function units and significant usage differences even within the same function unit in a library. In addition to proposing this modified wayfinding framework and studying its relevance in explaining library space usage patterns, this study also makes a methodological contribution through a novel approach of detecting potential traffic patterns by visualizing routing data and quantifying its details at the route segment level.

Through a two-year ethnographic analysis comprising archives analysis, participant-observation, and 31 interviews, the data revealed that the forum's structure illustrated characteristics of a community of practice (CoP), a construct that has rarely been used in examining online health communities. Newcomers began as legitimate peripheral participants who progressed through the community from being novices, to novice/mentors, to mentor/experts. This progression represented a cycle of identification with three phases: a) an introductory phase, where novices made themselves known to the community and began to wrestle with breast cancer; b) learning the community's social practices and building identity as they evolved into novice/mentors who became more knowledgeable; and c) becoming mentor/experts who were looked up to and could provide information and support to others. Attaining mentor/expert status indicated a completion of the cycle in that mentor/experts were identified as being central to the community, and were also participating in the introduction phase by welcoming novices. Analyzing online health communities using a CoP perspective offers a lens that provides insights into the mechanisms that assist patients as they navigate through illness and treatment. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",""

This study examines the effects of six-year integrated information literacy instruction on elementary students' memory and comprehension of subject content through inquiry learning and also focuses on the moderating factor of students' academic achievement levels. The subjects were 75 students participating in the study from the time when they entered elementary school. The school adopted information literacy instruction and integrated it into various subject areas using the framework of inquiry learning, for example, the Super3 and Big6 models. A total of 11 inquiry learning projects were implemented from Grade 1 through Grade 6. The results showed that inquiry-based integrated information literacy instruction helps students memorize facts and apply new concepts in the subject content. In general, the progress level in comprehension was higher than in memory learning for the six-year integrated information literacy instruction. Regardless of students' prior academic achievement levels, if they devoted their efforts to inquiry processes, their fact memorization and conceptual understanding of subject content improved.

Search tasks reflected the following search tactics: known-author search, topical search, open-ended browsing, search by analogy, and searching without a query. The most used search moves in both catalogs across all tasks were querying, search results inspection, and book page examination. In a traditional catalog, more effort was needed in the form of queries, search moves, and opened book pages to gain equivalent average book scores when compared with an enriched catalog. In a traditional catalog, a typical search strategy for interesting titles seemed to involve issuing queries and considering suitable entry terms carefully, and devoting more attention to search results instead of book pages. In an enriched catalog, a common approach involved time devoted to exploring the catalog's enriched front page and multiple entry points together with attention to the enriched results list. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",""

However, the cataloger still has to deal with the difficult task of deciding what information to include. The SciELO Suggester system is an innovative tool developed to overcome certain general limitations encountered in current mechanisms for entering descriptions of library records. The proposed tool provides useful suggestions about what information to include in newly created records. Thus, it assists catalogers with their task, as they are typically unfamiliar with the heterogeneous nature of the incoming material. The suggester tool applies case-based reasoning to generate suggestions taken from material previously cataloged in the SciELO scientific electronic library. The system is implemented as a web service and it can be easily used by installing an add-on for the Mozilla Firefox browser. The tool has been evaluated through a human-subject study with catalogers and through an automatic test using a collection consisting of 5742 training examples and 120 test cases from 12 different subject areas. In both experiments the system has shown very good performance. These evaluations indicate that the use of case-based reasoning provides a powerful alternative to traditional ways of identifying subject areas and keywords in library resources. In addition, a heuristic evaluation of the tool was carried out by taking as a starting point the Sirius heuristic-based framework, resulting in a very good score. Finally, a specially designed cognitive walk was completed with catalogers, providing additional insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the tool. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",""

As an example of this development, public and university libraries are studied from the point of view of teleworking. Although work still only accounts for a small amount of the activities that take place in libraries, its transformations can be seen as a 'weak signal' of newly emerging spatial arrangements. In addition to the home and workplace, teleworkers are using a network of public, semi-public and private spaces (so-called third places) for different types of working. The research used the concept ""spatial portfolio"" to address this phenomenon of spatial modalities. The new role of public libraries within this context is discussed. In addition to their traditional functions of lending books and providing spaces for reading newspapers and magazines, libraries are now becoming more multifunctional, providing space for different activities, including work. This new phenomenon has been studied empirically by conducting a qualitative interview and observing teleworkers in two public libraries and one university library in the City of Helsinki, Finland. The objective was to find and analyze different profiles of workers in libraries, thus providing input for future planning and design of these spaces, as well as the urban fabric around them. The results show that a considerable range of activities within research and education, art and culture, information technology, business and finance, and social services and government are performed in the libraries, all of which are in part supported by the new concepts and policies of the city. Libraries can be seen as 'transitory workspaces' where people work at least a couple of hours per week and for different reasons such as free wifi connection and location. Also, libraries might be considered 'spatial incubators' or rather places able to attract people who start up their own activities. These concepts contribute to define a new way of appropriating libraries. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",""

There has been a long-running debate on the use of indicators based on citation counts to measure research quality. The key argument is that using indicators based on raw citation counts to evaluate research quality lacks measurement validity. Traditional reference formats do not present any quality related evaluations of the citing authors toward their references. It can be argued that the strength of peer evaluation to a research output, which is taken to represent its quality, is the elementary unit in the evaluation and comparison of research performance. A good candidate for evaluating a piece of research is a researcher who cites the research and knows it well. By accumulating different citing authors' evaluations of their references based on a uniform evaluation scheme and synthesizing the evaluations into a single indicator, the qualities of research works, scientists, journals, research groups, and institutions in different disciplines can be assessed and compared. A method consisting of three components is proposed: a reference evaluation scheme, a new reference format, and a new indicator, called the average evaluation intensity. This method combines the advantages of citation count analysis, citation motivation analysis, and peer review, and may help to advance the debate. The potential advantages of and main concerns about the proposed method are discussed. The proposed method may serve as a preliminary theoretical framework that can inspire and advance a quality-oriented approach to the evaluation of research performance. At the current stage, it is best to treat the proposed method as speculation and inspiration rather than as a blueprint for practical implementation. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Citation analysis; Citation motivation; Research performance evaluation; Research quality; Scientific indicators"

This exploratory observation study examines how 15 Australian preschool children (aged three to five) used information technologies in their homes to orient themselves in daily life and to solve problems. Children engaged in various ways with the digital technologies available to them and with parents and siblings during play activities. The results explore the value of artistic play, sociodramatic play, and early literacy and numeracy activities in shaping young children's ‘way of life’ and ‘mastery of life’ as outlined in Savolainen's (1995) ELIS model. Observed technology engagement provided an opportunity to explore children's social worlds and the ways that they gathered information during technology play that will inform future learning activities and support child development. By using ELIS theory as an analytic lens, the results demonstrate how children's developmental play with technology tools helps them to internalize social and cultural norms. The data also point to the type of capital available to children and how that capital contributes to children's emerging information practices. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",""

As the outcome of the driven adaptation, licensing work has emerged as a new specialization in academic librarianship. The theory explains the major concerns in the licensing work: how licensing librarians adapt to licensing work and how they handle the challenges in this relatively new specialization. It also identifies the behaviors practitioners engage in as they cope with licensing work. Findings of this study can help new electronic resources librarians to adapt to licensing more effectively. This theory can also be expanded and generalized to explain the creation and assimilation of any new specialization of work. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",""

An experiment was conducted to test the effects of two psychological constructs in the persuasion process, namely, user's knowledge of and involvement with a literary genre. A novel aspect of the study is that the participants were exposed to reviews contradictory to their initial impression. Contrary to negativity bias widely found in previous studies of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM), a positivity effect of online reviews was found. High and low involvement readers were found to rely on different judgment cues. Furthermore, it is argued that when applied in cultural consumption, the measurement of these constructs demands special treatment because of its “infinite variety” and strong hedonistic character. Involvement at the genre level helped enhance preference stability. However, such effects were not found with users' subjective knowledge at the genre level. Instead, similarity became an important judgment heuristic when users encountered books by unknown authors. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",""

Because social science data differ from data in the hard sciences, it is necessary to explicitly examine social science data reuse. This study explores the data reuse behaviors of social scientists in order to better understand both the factors that influence those social scientists' intentions to reuse data and the extent to which those factors influence actual data reuse. Using an integrated theoretical model developed from the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and the technology acceptance model (TAM), this study provides a broad explanation of the relationships among factors influencing social scientists' data reuse. A total of 292 survey responses were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings suggest that social scientists' data reuse intentions are directly influenced by the subjective norm of data reuse, attitudes toward data reuse, and perceived effort involved in data reuse. Attitude toward data reuse mediated social scientists' intentions to reuse data, leading to the indirect influence of the perceived usefulness and perceived concern of data reuse, as well as the indirect influence of the subjective norm of data reuse. Finally, the availability of a data repository indirectly influenced social scientists' intentions to reuse data by reducing the perceived effort involved. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",""

Over 1900 research articles were obtained from three major journals published between 2001 and 2010 in library and information science (LIS). Each selected article was coded using a schema of research methods developed in this study. The coded data, along with related publications, were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. This exploration shows that research methods comprise data collection techniques (e.g., interview, observation) and data analysis techniques (e.g., qualitative, quantitative). Research methods should perhaps be categorized by data collection technique, as it makes more sense than if research methods are labeled as qualitative or quantitative. This study is one of the many efforts to facilitate a better understanding of research methods in LIS and help scholars make more informed decisions about research method selection in their endeavors. Its implications can be extended to LIS research education, training, and advocacy. Because research methods themselves are not discipline-specific, researchers beyond the LIS field would benefit from this study as well. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",""

For example, their involvement in research data management (RDM) implies a much deeper relationship with researchers throughout the research lifecycle. Perhaps we are witnessing a shift from support to partnership. This study examines how librarians, IT staff, and research administrators see research and their own relation to it. Within an interpretative methodology, 20 semi-structured interviews with librarians, IT staff, and research administrators were analyzed thematically. Librarians often talked about research via the discourse of research-led teaching. They also conceived of it via notions of collection and to a lesser extent through reference work or copyright expertise. They saw some of their own continuing professional development or service development work as akin to the work of university researchers, but at the other end of a spectrum. Some saw a categorical difference and considered that research was only conducted by people who had a job title of researcher. IT managers tended to see research via infrastructure or specialist expertise. However, at least one IT staff member saw himself as both partly a researcher and a bridge between research and support. Research administrators tended to see research through the roles of administrative support and policy influence. In summary, seven broad narratives about research were identified: influencing researchers to align with policy; being a researcher; being a bridge with research; offering expertise; providing infrastructure; supporting a research/teaching nexus; and relieving researchers of administrative burdens. As institutions develop research partnerships, e.g., around RDM, training and curricula will need to expand existing conceptions and build deeper empathetic relationships with research. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",""

For the effective use of public funds it is necessary for there to be an objective method for the assessment of the effectiveness of the public services (i.e. including digital services). A methodology that can analyse the effectiveness of the digital services provided by public organizations is proposed. The methodology was applied to the digital services provided by the Municipal Library of Prague (MLP). This methodology allows comparison of the effectiveness of the different services provided. This contributes to the effectiveness of the decisions of public representatives and overall social effectiveness of the digital services provided. The results show that the effectiveness of digital services (provided by remote access) at the MLP in 2012 is 4.02 (this means that each unit of financial investment brings benefits in the amount of 4.02 units). In contrast, digital services provided directly in the library have a very low effectiveness, i.e. 1:0.89, thus they are clearly ineffective. In addition, when compared to all the services that are provided, digital services have the highest effectiveness of all. The proposed methodology can therefore help economic decision-making but also to improve the quality and range of services. It can be used in other organizations and various public sectors. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",""

This is because disciplinary studies of IL have focused mainly on people's conceptions of IL, not on their lived teaching and learning practices. Introducing university assignments as a contextual construct for disciplinary studies of IL, this study demonstrates how students' and educators' conceptions and experiences of real university assignments and their constructive participation in conceptualization of IL helped to uncover the actual nature of information need in the discipline of geographic information science/systems (GIS) and to gain a better understanding of the concept of, and requirements for, determining information need in this discipline. Adopting an embedded case study design and a participatory approach for fieldwork, the data were mainly gathered from 27 semistructured interviews focused on GIS students' and educators' lived experiences of university assignments and their reflections on various aspects of IL in a master's degree GIS program jointly delivered by universities in the UK and USA. Each learning and teaching experience was treated as a unit of analysis. GIS assignments were found to be geospatial, technology mediated, subject free, and unique in requirements. Each characteristic uncovered a new facet for the concept of information need in GIS. Findings indicate that unless students have understood the multi-faceted nature of information need, they may fail to distinguish the various ways in which gaps may be addressed when dealing with GIS assignments. The context-to-concept approach proposed in this study can be of value to both IL researchers and practitioners who seek deeper insights into the nature of IL, especially those interested in the customization of generic models of IL to the actual needs of university programs. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",""

Information is a critical tool in any poultry farming activity. Access to poultry management information in three rural districts of Tanzania is explored. The findings show that information on disease control, poultry protection, breeds and breeding, and feeding and nutrition were the most accessed topics. Farmers relied on informal sources of information, mainly from family, friends, neighbors, extension officers, researchers, and radio. Information that had direct impact on poultry well-being was the most frequently accessed. The major challenges that limited farmers in information seeking were lack of availability of extension officers, lack of awareness, lack of availability of information, lack of electricity, and poor infrastructure.

Thus, academic librarians have expressed concern about the under-utilization of resources provided through library Web portals. Studies of technology acceptance and success indicate that user training can positively influence individuals' use of information systems. Even so, there has been no investigation of the longterm effects of user education on the use of library Web portals. This longitudinal study fills this gap in the literature by determining whether a semester-long, credit-bearing, general education course integrated with an information literacy component positively alters undergraduate students' perceptions and increases their use of the university libraries' web portal at a mid-size research institution. A mixed methods approach was employed, collecting data through three rounds of survey (pre-course, post-course, and follow-up) as well as one-on-one interviews. Results from the quantitative analysis indicated variance in participants' perceptions and use of the libraries' portal from the short-term to a longer term. The positive influence of the course was validated through a manipulation check. The outcome of interviews also confirmed the findings derived from the quantitative data. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",""

This research presents the descriptive analysis of a systematic survey of North American library and information science (LIS) faculty about their attitudes toward and experience with OA publishing. The study reveals that LIS faculty tend to be more experienced with and knowledgeable about open access than their colleagues in other disciplines. A majority of LIS faculty is very critical of what is perceived to be detrimental control exercised by publishers over the scholarly communication system and agrees that major changes need to be made to this system. Although a majority of LIS faculty considers OA journals to be comparable to traditional journals, a sizable minority remains unconvinced of the purported benefits of open-access journals. The perceived constraints of the tenure and promotion system within the academy tend to limit LIS faculty engagement with open-access publishing in ways similar to other academic disciplines.

This study analyzes how private actors communicate with and through public library systems by parsing the signals into components: transmitter, receiver, medium, and message. The resulting signals form two dimensions: the Public Sphere dimension, where private actors govern, legitimate, and use the library, and the Private Sphere dimension, where private actors exchange personal services and exert economic power.

Higher education institutions have to understand the Internet information-seeking behaviors of students and how they perceive electronic resources in order to effectively fulfill their mission of equipping students with relevant and contemporary knowledge and skills. The influence of four background variables (gender, level of study, enrollment status, and field of study) was examined in the analysis of data from 900 students at one Croatian university. The results show that students mostly use Wikipedia and similar online resources, as well as university websites, including websites of university libraries. The level and field of study are strong predictors of differences in the frequency of use of certain Internet sources. Factor analysis revealed four factors: tendency to use, advantages of using, incentives and reasons for using, and prerequisites for using electronic resources. These factors represent the underlying constructs by which students' perceptions of electronic resources can be classified. The findings further indicate that students only slightly prefer electronic over printed resources, although they highly value the benefits of the use of electronic formats. In addition, it has been revealed that students believe that they are well equipped and possess competencies for the effective use of electronic resources. Differences based on the factors have been largely confirmed with regard to gender and field of study, but not to the level of study and enrollment status.

The research model was tested with a total of 1298 responses from a national survey in the United States (US). The data analysis results, using the partial least squares (PLS) technique, show that attitudinal beliefs (including perceived career benefit, risk, and perceived effort), disciplinary norms, and perceived availability of data repositories all have significant impacts on STEM researchers' attitudes toward data sharing, and further, both the attitude toward data sharing and the availability of data repositories have strong influences on researchers' data sharing behaviors. These results demonstrate that the theory of planned behavior is a useful theoretical framework for explaining STEM researchers' data sharing behaviors. From the practical perspective, this research suggests that information professionals can better serve STEM researchers by allocating their efforts in two ways: (1) Providing appropriate data services and tools to reduce researchers' efforts involved in data sharing, and (2) providing data repositories to facilitate researchers' data sharing behaviors. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",""

Outcome measures can present the benefits public libraries bring to individuals in terms that are relevant to them. Beyond service-specific outcome assessments, however, few nationwide studies have examined the benefits of public libraries as a whole. Following the Finnish national survey conducted by Vakkari and Serola (2012), this study surveyed more than 1000 U.S. respondents on 22 areas of benefits. The benefits were reduced by factor analysis to three dimensions. ANOVAs were used to test demographic differences in these benefit dimensions. The findings show that most respondents viewed the impact of public libraries on their lives positively. The most frequently perceived benefit was in the reading and self-education dimension. Significant gender and education attainment differences were found for this dimension, with women and more educated respondents giving more positive responses. In contrast, age and race/ethnicity differences were significant in the work and formal education dimension and in the everyday activities and interests dimension. In both dimensions, younger respondents and ethnic minorities reported more positive responses. For the everyday activities dimension, higher-income respondents reported more frequent benefits. Overall, the public library was perceived by different demographic groups as contributing to different dimensions of their lives. There are still areas for further improvement, such as reaching lower-income individuals and seniors in the everyday activities dimension. Continual efforts are needed to measure and communicate the value of public libraries, so that funders and the public will support public libraries with the resources needed to provide quality services to all. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",""

In addition, the HIV/AIDS context is characterized by significant affective or emotional aspects including stigma, fear, and coping. Thus, studies of information behavior in this context should be expected to take account of emotional variables. In information behavior scholarship, emotional variables have been marginalized in favor of a focus on cognitive aspects, although in recent years greater attention has been paid to the affective realm. This study used quantitative content analysis to explore the degree to which information behavior studies across a range of disciplines actually include affect or emotion in their analyses. Findings suggest that most studies pay little or no attention to these variables, and that attention has not changed over the past 20. years. Those studies that do account for emotion, however, provide excellent examples of information behavior research that can lead the way for future work. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Affect; Content analysis; Emotion; HIV/AIDS; Information behavior"

Academic libraries and librarians have taken the lead in the development of information literacy programmes. Whilst there has been much sharing of good practise, there has been less consideration of alternative models of the outcomes of information literacy programmes. To contribute to addressing this gap, this article reports on an evaluation of student peer delivery of an information literacy scheme in the specific context of a medical and health information portal. The Student Champion Scheme (SCS) is an initiative designed to promote the use of a national specialist health and social care information portal, Evidence Search, amongst students in the health professions, and thereby to further embed evidence-based practise. The SCS run by NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, UK), uses a model of training, in which student champions are first trained by NICE staff, and then the champions train their peers. This study evaluates the scheme on the basis of secondary data gathered by NICE during the evaluation processes associated with two annual cycles of the SCS, together with focus groups with champions, and interviews with prospective university-based co-facilitators of the scheme. Findings suggest that the scheme is successful in promoting use of the portal, Evidence Search, and in developing advocates amongst champions. The evaluation offers a range of insights into the benefits and challenges associated with such a scheme, whose interest and implications extend beyond this specific scheme. To be successful the quality of peer training and peers' identification with and belief in the value of both the training they deliver, and specific information sources is pivotal. In addition, training is strengthened by contributions from librarians and academics, and a climate in which all participants are clear about their specific contribution. It is recommended that academic libraries should seek to develop a range of differentiated information literacy programmes, each with specific objectives, to suit different audiences, and undertake regular evaluation as a basis for improvement and innovation. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",""

A recent study developed a user-perceived task difficulty reason scheme including 21 reasons (two of which arise prior to searching). Interesting questions arose as to whether the many difficulty reasons in the scheme were correlated or whether the difficulty reasons were related to task difficulty levels. Using a dataset collected from 48 participants searching on four tasks, this study examined these questions while also validating the task difficulty reason scheme. Results suggest that the 19 difficulty reasons elicited after a search task are rarely correlated, and are, instead, independent. Several difficulty reasons, such as “task requirements too specific” and “low topic knowledge,” contribute significantly to difficulty levels. The large discrepancy in the frequency of some reasons’ appearance in high, mid, and low difficulty rating groups may be explained by task type features. These findings help develop an in-depth explanation of search task difficulty and contribute to task-related information retrieval research and system design. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",""

This paper presents only a portion of the findings: those from respondents in the field of linguistics. The study began with the general assumption that newspapers are a relevant information source for scientific research in the humanities, but their potential is not fully exploited because of limited access to newspaper collections and search options. An additional assumption was that newspapers are especially important in linguistics research because they reflect the evolution of and changes in a language and provide information on the relations between a language and its socio-political context in a certain place and time. The results partially confirmed these assumptions, showing a clear divide between those who perceive newspapers as an important research source and those who do not. In addition, respondents expressed the need for better technological solutions, but they do not always use those already available to them. The results also show perceptions of the value of and actual use of newspapers; information behavior related to newspapers (e.g., type and format of newspapers used, type of information need in newspapers, motivation for newspaper use, employed search strategies, and approaches to managing information from newspapers); and the challenges researchers face in using newspapers.

The findings demonstrate significant regional variations in accessibility that have been persistent over time and cannot be explained by simple population distribution measures alone. Distances to the nearest public library are higher in the South compared to other regions, with statistically significant clusters of states with lower accessibility than average. The national average population-weighted distance to the nearest public library is 2.1 miles.

This study explores these questions through a set of parallel surveys sent to a national sample of high school and college librarians. Findings suggest that high school and college librarians agree on the importance of most skills though they vary in their emphasis on their importance, and that information literacy skills are being taught in high school but do not seem to transfer to college.

Thirty-eight participants participated in the study. Their mental models of MedlinePlus were measured by a concept listing protocol and an interview method at three time points: after they freely explored the system for 5. min (T1), after the first search session (T2), and after the second search session (T3). The analysis revealed that participants constructed their mental models of MedlinePlus based on the schemas that they have of information-rich web spaces. The model construction process involved changes and development in three parallel dimensions: cognition, emotion, and behavior. The development is enabled and coordinated by three mental activities: assimilating new concepts, modifying existing concepts, and phasing out previously perceived concepts. Furthermore, mental model construction is not only a function of users' internal cognition, but also affected by external cognitive structures, including the system, system feedback, and tasks. Mental model construction is also a process distributed over time. The results suggested that mental models could serve as a framework for guiding user research and system design.

Based on the empirical analysis of the Connotea users, who are primarily in academia, the study shows that experienced academic users generally prefer to use social bookmarking while moderately experienced and novice users still prefer to use the traditional bookmarking methods, such as creating and using bookmarks on a dedicated computer. Experienced academic users were also found to create more tags per bookmark comparing to the other two groups. Most novice academic users, however, only created one tag per bookmark, which just met Connotea's minimum requirement. Surprisingly different from the collaborative design nature of the social bookmarking systems, the study finds that our participants, particularly experienced academic users, prefer to create and use their own bookmarks rather than sharing bookmarks created by others. In fact, experienced users have significantly higher frequency (once every two weeks) of creating bookmarks than the other two groups (once a month or less). In addition, website design features and functions, such as automatic collection of bibliographic information, are regarded by all participants as helpful for information discovery. The in-depth examination and discussion of the opinions of Connotea users may be useful for further improvement of the design features and usage applications, particularly for academic social bookmarking websites.

The proposition is that the major reason for nonlinearity in information practices is a continuous shifting of actors' interests, pressures, and concerns. Capturing these dynamic relations becomes possible through this model. The model also offers a way to generate a number of research questions and hypotheses, and as such it could be a useful tool for empirical studies on information sharing in academic communities. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",""

In order to better comprehend this largely symbolic phenomenon, this study focused on the arguments that book challengers employed to justify the removal, relocation, or restriction of books in 13 challenge cases in public libraries and schools across the United States between 2007 and 2011. Three sources of discourse, which were coded for common themes, were analyzed. The first consisted of a variety of documents, obtained via state open record requests to governing bodies, which were produced in the course of challenge cases. Recordings of book challenge public hearings constituted the second source of data. The third source of discourse consisted of interviews with challengers. The study found the following common themes in challengers' worldviews: First, they saw contemporary society as being in a state of decline and were concerned with preserving the innocence of children in the midst of this decay. Second, they constructed public institutions as symbols of the community that must represent their values and aid parents in their difficult role as boundary setters. Finally, challengers demonstrated a reverence for the books as a material object and employed common sense interpretive strategies. It is hoped that this analysis will offer a starting point for comparing the discourse of challengers to the discourse of other social actors and aid librarians and other information professionals in providing effective responses to challengers to materials in their respective institutions. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Censorship; Discourse analysis; Intellectual freedom; Reading practices"

The potential added-value of using user-contributed (""social"") terms from Flickr and the English Wikipedia in image indexing is compared with using two expert-created controlled vocabularies-the Thesaurus for Graphic Materials and the Library of Congress Subject Headings-without those social terms. Experiments confirmed that the social terms did add value, relative to terms from the controlled vocabularies. The median rating for the usefulness of social terms was significantly higher than the baseline rating, but was lower than the ratings for the terms from the Thesaurus for Graphic Materials and the Library of Congress Subject Headings. Furthermore, complementing the controlled vocabulary terms with social terms more than doubled the average coverage of participants' terms for a photograph. The relationships between user demographics and users' perceptions of the value of terms were also investigated, as well as the relationships between user demographics and indexing quality, as measured by the number of terms participants assigned to a photograph.

The study was based on Bandura's four sources of self-efficacy information: (a) past performance or mastery experiences; (b) vicarious observation of others' experiences; (c) verbal or social feedback; and, (d) affective states. An online survey presenting the Information Retrieval Self-Efficacy Scale was distributed among three existing Israeli LIS discussion groups. The questionnaire was completed by 201 LIS professionals. Findings show that participants reported a high level of self-efficacy regarding information retrieval and all four sources of self-efficacy information influenced the construction of self-efficacy beliefs. Correlations between self-efficacy perceptions and several socio-demographic variables were investigated. The data analysis revealed that men and women are impacted differently by self-efficacy information; women reported a higher score for affective states and men are more prone to frustration. Also, a significant relation was found between age and years of experience, as well as the sources that exerted more influence on participants. Older and more experienced participants reported being more impacted by their mastery experiences and their affective states.

Many physiological and psychological factors can have an impact on the depth of visual perception in terms of categorization and interpretation of meaning. Picture books tell stories to children with a combination of texts and images. Children's interaction with picture books shows relationships with visual perception; visual perception has an impact on children's categorization and narratives and illustrations of picture books are works of art that can provide sources for children to appreciate art and enhance their visual perception. Three to five-year-old children are characterized by a reliance on their perception because they see what appears to them. At public libraries, schools, and homes children often read picture books for learning and recreation. Thirty-one three- to five-year-old children from one public library, one preschool, and home schools were recruited to interpret images of two picture books in short interviews.

Three undergraduate students carried a reader/writer and explored information sources in a library to complete a given set of tasks. Data regarding the traveling paths and information sources used were collected. The information offers insight into participants' information-seeking patterns. For example, all participants started in the online public access catalog zone; they used secondary sources for fact-based tasks more than for topic-based tasks. In addition, they spent the most time exploring the general book zone. A small percentage of tag recordings had to be removed or created because of errors in transmission readings; however, the procedure and results of the experiment were not affected.

Both representations are content independent, attribute equal importance to each of the three stages, and target the K-12 educational environment. The full representation, the preparing, searching, using (PSU) model, is intended for use by instructors and more advanced students. The model identifies elements inherent within the three stages of the research process including actions, affective behaviors, impact factors, learning, and reflection.

Enactment, an evidence-based concept, is introduced as a theoretical tool that refers to the phenomenon of information and media use leading to action in concrete daily activities. The research strategy was qualitative, consisting of content analysis of semi-structured interviews of 13 retired teachers and the media diaries of 306 older adult Finns. Fifteen categories of information and media use were proposed and grouped into four forms of enactment on the basis of their temporal nature, namely, direct or indirect engagement: 1) general routines and housework, 2) healthy lifestyle, 3) cognitive tasks, and 4) interaction with others. Enactment takes place when older adults' everyday information behavior leads to observable actions, such as organizing their daily activities, preparing food, exercising and engaging in healthy activities, practicing language skills, or filling in crossword puzzles. These findings support the notion that use of information and the media can motivate older adults to stay active in life. Therefore, the concept of enactment may prove useful in gaining a better understanding of certain physical, cognitive, and social aspects of everyday information behavior and their impact on people's well-being.

However, health-related information and services have a lower profile than other services due to a perceived lack of librarian expertise in searching and evaluating health resources. Although public library users are actively seeking health information, it has become critical for both public librarians and users to develop skills for using and evaluating Internet health resources. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify a set of useful criteria to evaluate online health web sites for both librarians and library users. From a comprehensive literature review, 33 criteria related to health website evaluation were identified. Using this set of criteria, South Korean public librarians and users were asked to rate the importance of each criterion in surveys. A strong consensus was found between the two groups. The top 10 most highly rated criteria from both groups were identified and compared. The results led to the development of an initial set of 12 evaluation criteria for health websites. It is expected that the final set of criteria will be used by public librarians to recommend the best health websites to their users. Although the study was conducted in South Korean public libraries, the findings are applicable in providing evaluation services of health websites to libraries worldwide. © 2012.",""

Although several accessibility analyses have been conducted of public libraries, these studies tend to measure the distance from the users' homes to the library using straight lines. This generally serves as a poor measurement of actual travel distances. In order to provide more realistic analysis, and measure patterns of library access more accurately, this study employed geographic information systems (GIS), including descriptive and statistical analyses, and a road network-based distance measure. One finding from the GIS analyses was that distance was a determining factor for library use. Specifically, the evidence shows that distance affected a considerable number of registered users who lived within the areas that were defined through Thiessen polygons. Another finding was that there was a difference in the travel distance between ethnic groups: Caucasians went further to access public libraries than other ethnic groups. Finally, in terms of the relationship between distance and demographic data, household characteristics relative to children and education level were significantly related to the travel distance of users. To improve the accessibility of public libraries, this study recommends librarians define service areas for libraries, develop library programs and services for susceptible user groups, and evaluate user groups' needs. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",""

However, adjusting to life in a different country can be stressful and require significant effort. Sojourners need to not only maintain and expand their social networks, but they also continuously seek information about their new environment. While international students are a sizable group, their daily information behavior is not well understood. This study posits that social networking sites (SNS), such as Facebook, may play an important role in international students' everyday life information seeking (ELIS). Using descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and structural equation modeling (SEM), the study analyzed international students' everyday life information needs, their usage of SNS for ELIS, and the relationships among demographics, personality traits, SNS usage, and perceived usefulness of the acquired everyday life information. Findings indicate that a majority of the respondents frequently used SNS for ELIS. Younger students, undergraduates, and extroverts were more likely to use SNS for ELIS, while no gender difference was found. Notably, among the nine user characteristics and behavior factors, SNS usage emerged as the only positive predictor of perceived usefulness of acquired information in meeting daily needs. This indicates that SNS serve as a valuable channel for purposeful everyday life information seeking. Beyond its social support value, the ELIS value of SNS is a fruitful area for future research. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",""

Studies combining groups (e.g., Lane et al., 2012) have shown high correlations between two factors, suggesting the possibility that a two-factor model may fit as well as the three-factor model theorized by the developers. Also, previous studies have not closely examined residuals to analyze local misfit in the context of theory but instead have often correlated error terms to improve model fit. This study uses LibQUAL. + responses from undergraduates at a public, comprehensive university to test three-factor, two-factor, and one-factor models of user perceptions of library service quality. Global fit indices indicated that both two-factor and three-factor models were empirically supported, but the three-factor model had better theoretical support. Furthermore, this article adds to the literature the unique perspective of residual analysis and builds theoretical arguments in the interpretation of the final model. Areas of local misfit suggest the need for independent studies to examine residuals. If areas of misfit repeat across institutional populations, that could suggest the potential for further instrument development, while if areas of misfit are unique to institutional populations, this could target areas for institutions to investigate more closely. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",""

Answers, a social question-and-answering (Q&A) service. Through statistical analysis differences among the three participant groups, how the background characteristics influenced their assessments, and the relationships between characteristics of the content of answers and quality evaluation criteria were each considered in detail. Librarians and nurses shared similar ratings of answer quality, but had differences in their level of medical knowledge and the types of services they offer, resulting in minor differences across criteria. Users perceived the quality of health answers in social Q&A to be higher than librarians and nurses for almost all criteria. Depending on the sources of information presented in health answers, librarians, nurses, and users gave different quality assessments. Implications exist for research into and practice of evaluating the quality of health information, which need to address both search and domain expertise along with the sharing of socioemotional values preferred by users. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",""

Outcomes of the focus group provide early empirical evidence to confirm that whilst there is considerable goodwill towards research and the development of the evidence base in health librarianship, there are existing challenges between working for the interests of both the library service user and development of the evidence base in healthcare, and the evidence based progression of the health librarianship profession. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",""

Research on emotional labor shows that there can be positive and negative effects on individuals such as job satisfaction and job burnout. Research also shows that the negative outcomes from emotional labor may be buffered to some extent by factors such as support from the organization, or job autonomy. Individual differences such as personality traits and attitudes toward customers also impact the effects of emotional labor on employees.

Strategic planning is widely recognized as a challenging activity, however, which can be both time consuming and unproductive, and there exists limited guidance regarding how to evaluate documented and disseminated strategic plans, particularly within the not-for-profit sector. In response, this research proposes and tests an inspection-based approach to the evaluation of strategic plans, based upon a rubric specifying the key attributes of each of the core components of a plan, combined with an appropriate assessment scale. The rubric provides a method to identify and assess completeness of strategic plan, extending to qualitative assessment of communication aspects such as specification and terminology, and synergistic aspects such as cohesion and integration. In the most comprehensive study of its kind to date, the method is successfully trialed across the devolved Scottish public library sector, with the strategic plans of 28 of the 32 regional networks evaluated. Of the 28 plans, 17, or 61%, were found to be incomplete and/or to contain contradictory or uncoordinated components. It is recommended that Scottish public libraries improve not only completeness of plans, but also their precision, specificity, explicitness, coordination, and consistency, and overall mapping to library services. Recommendations are made for further widespread application of the rubric. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",""

Geographical information systems (GIS) have been used to investigate library service areas, to aid initial location decisions, and to model the implications of the opening and closure of library services. Recent studies have promoted the use of GIS-based techniques to investigate spatial variations in accessibility to public and private services in relation to socio-economic characteristics of population groups. One such technique, based on floating catchment area (FCA) approaches, has been primarily used to investigate potential inequalities in health services, access to employment and leisure opportunities, as well as planning public transport. In this study, FCA techniques are used to research variations in accessibility to public library facilities using bespoke application tools developed within a commercial GIS package. Drawing on a preliminary analysis of variations in accessibility to library services in a local authority area in south Wales, UK, a case study is presented whereby GIS-based models can be used to investigate spatial variations in digital services provision. As a result, provision gaps of such services can be identified. This study's findings help guide national government delivery programs to promote digital inclusion. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",""

The analysis quantifies the long tail concept and is applicable to all libraries and information services, independent of their size and circulation properties. The paradigm of the Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient from macroeconomics is adapted in the context of information services. The Gini coefficient examines the skewness of the Lorenz curve against an ideal cumulative distribution that is represented by a 45-degree line. In this context, the Lorenz curve depicts the cumulative percentage of collection items versus the number of loans and identifies the different levels of library resource use on the part of users by measuring how close the Gini coefficient is to the unity (i.e., the Gini of the 45-degree line is identified). © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",""

In many cases, teachers present the only opportunity for students to develop information literacy proficiency. With semi-structured interviews, this study explored eight secondary teachers' perceptions of information literacy and their experiences with IL as educational professionals. Confusion around the phrase information literacy was a dominant theme as participants were unfamiliar with the term and were inconsistent in defining the scope of what it might mean. Although there are references to information literacy skills in the core curriculum and support documents, participants varied in their instruction and understanding of this skill set. Participants unanimously agreed that information literacy skills, as explained using the Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Standards for Higher Education (ACRL, 2000), were important for their students. However, the extent of IL skills required varied by student. Pursuing post-secondary studies warranted advanced IL, and these students were more likely to be taught higher-level skills. IL skill development was also assumed to be the responsibility of the student, and passive acquisition was anticipated. Assumptions regarding student need and ability informed instruction. These results suggest that the current curricular mandates are insufficient to ensure IL is incorporated into instruction and that teachers are ill-prepared to instruct IL effectively. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",""

A quantitative approach was applied to demonstrate how institutional data can be combined to examine library use and retention at a single institution. Undergraduate student and library use data were analyzed to identify results that suggested associations between library use and student retention. Library use was measured by log-ins to electronic resources, as well as borrowing from the library. The undergraduate students enrolled for the first time in 2010 comprised the population, Sub-group student characteristics, age and socioeconomic status, underwent further analysis.

This shift toward so-called big science also brought about a concomitant change in scientific work itself, with a sustained trend toward the use of highly specialized scientific teams, elevating the role of team characteristics on scientific outputs. The actual impact of scientific knowledge is commonly measured by how often peer-reviewed publications are, in turn, cited by other researchers. Therefore, how characteristics such as author team seniority, affiliation diversity, and size affect the overall impact of team publications was examined. Citation information and author demographics were reviewed for 123 articles published in. Physical Review Letters from 2004 to 2006 and written by 476 scientists who used the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory's facilities. Correlation analysis indicated that author teams that were more multi-institutional and had homogeneous seniority tended to have more senior scientists. In addition, the analysis suggests that more mixed seniority author teams were likely to be less institutionally dispersed. Quantile regression was used to examine the relationships between author-team characteristics and publication impact.

This study examines how genomics scientists' perceived priorities for data quality and data quality skills differ when assuming different roles played in genomics data curation work. The analysis of survey data collected from 147 genomics scientists found that curators of genomics data valued quality criteria that can be assessed through direct examination of the data more highly, while end users placed a high value on the quality criteria that can be assessed indirectly, such as believability. With regard to data quality skills, curators appeared to care more about understanding user's requirements and specific data management skills than end users, while end users valued the skills needed to deal with information overload more highly - those needed to identify useful, relevant information from large amounts of data. Scientists with different curation roles, given common curation tasks with the same skill requirements, prioritized different data quality criteria.

One of the important properties of this network structure is referred to as social capital, which is the network of contacts and the associated values attached to these networks of contacts. This study provides empirical evidence of the influence of social capital and performance within the context of academic collaboration (coauthorship) and suggests that the collaborative process involves social capital embedded within relationships and network structures among direct coauthors. Association between scholars' social capital and their citation-based performance measures is examined. To overcome the limitations of traditional social network metrics for measuring the influence of scholars' social capital within coauthorship networks, the traditional social network metrics is extended by proposing two new measures, of which one is non-weighted (the power-diversity index) and the other (power-tie-diversity index) is weighted by the number of collaboration instances. The Spearman's correlation rank test is used to examine the association between scholars' social capital measures and their citation-based performance. Results suggest that research performance of authors is positively correlated with their social capital measures.

The former is considered to be a predictor of student academic achievement while the latter is considered a key factor in developing information literacy self-efficacy. Today, many students undertake paid employment in conjunction with their academic studies and little is known about the effect this may have on their information literacy self-efficacy and academic motivation. As such, the relationship between information literacy self-efficacy, academic motivation, and employment has been unexplored. Data were collected via a questionnaire, comprised of existing scales, which was administered to undergraduate business students in an Australian higher education (HE) institution. A response rate of 58% resulted in 585 completed questionnaires. Findings suggest that whether or not students were engaged in paid employment did not appear to influence information literacy self-efficacy, although students in paid employment did exhibit significantly lower intrinsic motivation than students not in paid employment. Additionally, for students not in paid employment a significant relationship was found between amount of time spent on study and information literacy self-efficacy. Of some concern, the small amount of time students reported spending in academic pursuits outside of scheduled classes raises issues regarding the placement of information literacy instruction.

This study systematically tested the measurement and structural invariance of LibQUAL+® scores in a sample of 1551 undergraduate students, 707 graduate students, and 134 faculty members. Multi-group confirmatory factor analyses showed that full measurement invariance did hold between students and faculty for the complete instrument. Building on the measurement invariance, structural invariance models showed that factor variances were equivalent across user groups, but factor covariances and means differed. Faculty had higher perceptions of Affect of Service and undergraduate students had higher perceptions of Library as Place compared to the other groups. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",""

The educational choices of students in library and information science (LIS) departments is an important aspect of the process through which they construct their ambitions, plans, and future capabilities, and so research on students' choices and their educational careers as social processes is also important. Through a detailed consideration of case study accounts of students from LIS departments in Greece, the argument for the importance of social and cultural factors in the formation of students' identity is advanced. Data were collected in two research phases using a questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews. Analysis of data demonstrates the complexity of the process of making educational choices, revealing how individual, family, social, and institutional factors interrelate with the ways young people cope with contingencies, and with social and personal relations. How these complex influences facilitate or impede students' trajectories within higher education institutions is also shown, as well as how they act upon the construction of their pedagogic identities. Of considerable significance is the finding that students from lower social class backgrounds tend to form pedagogic identities that are fragile. By contrast, students from families with significant amounts of cultural and social capital are in a position to exploit the academic and social resources of institutions, and to construct embedded identities with a strong scientific basis. More research is needed to illuminate how LIS departments could develop mechanisms to reduce such discrepancies. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",""

The credibility associated with these media is sometimes contested, and their acceptance into school practices has been debated. Focus group interviews with teachers and librarians in upper secondary schools in Sweden are used to investigate conceptions and experiences of activities involving the critical evaluation of participatory media, with a particular focus on Wikipedia. Three themes are addressed. The first concerns how the teaching of the critical evaluation of sources is organized and comanaged between teachers and librarians. The second describes educators' experiences of print versus digital media, and their worry because students have problems negotiating the information architecture of print media. The third theme deals with conceptions of the credibility of Wikipedia. Four conceptions of credibility are identified: credibility is associated with the control and stability of a source; it is considered to be strengthened when several sources support a claim; it is viewed as situational and partial, rather than absolute; and it is associated with a multiplicity of voices and democratic forms of production. These findings may be used to inform educational activities around credibility and authority in schools by raising self-awareness among educators of various ways to talk about the credibility of sources with both colleagues and students. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",""

Research on emotional labor suggests that performing emotional labor results in both positive and negative effects on individual outcomes, such as job satisfaction and job burnout. Since affective events are prevalent in library work and evidence suggests positive outcomes from emotional labor can be fostered, the ways emotional labor is performed in libraries should be studied. This research explores the key components of emotional labor: perceptions of display rules and the emotion regulation strategies of surface and deep acting. Data were collected from a sample of American librarians in 46 states from public, academic, special, and K-12 libraries who completed a survey. Bi-variate and multi-variate correlations, as well as ANOVAs, were used to test relationships among emotional labor constructs, job satisfaction, and job burnout. Results show evidence of significant associations with emotional labor among library employees in both the perception of display rules, as well as in surface and deep acting. Perception of display rules showed mixed results with job burnout and job satisfaction. Surface acting was found to be associated consistently with job burnout and decreased job satisfaction, while deep acting strategies were less strongly associated with negative outcomes. Findings suggest that library managers should clearly communicate display rule expectations to employees and work to build staff support to help meet those expectations. Library employees should be aware of occasions when they use surface acting and work to develop stronger deep acting techniques. The study contributes to an understanding of the influence of emotion management in the library workplace. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",""

Some of the ways in which these relationships and interactions may contribute to social capital include: building patrons' trust in the library and its staff, connecting people to both community and library resources, providing social support for patrons, reducing social isolation, helping patrons gain skills to function in an increasingly online world, and providing a positive place for neighborhood residents to gather.

This study focuses on how this differs according to the geographical location of the researcher, specifically in terms of the country's level of development. Data were collected by a questionnaire survey of 3650 authors who had published articles in international journals. The human development index (HDI) was used to compare authors' scholarly behavior. The findings show that researchers from less developed countries such as India and China (medium HDI) compared to those in developed countries, such as the USA and UK (very high HDI) are more reliant on external factors and those criteria that are related to authority, brand and reputation, such as authors' names, affiliation, country and journal name. Even when deciding where to publish, the publisher of the journal is more important for developing countries than it is for researchers from the US and UK. Scholars from high HDI countries also differ in these aspects: a) they are less discriminatory than authors from developing countries in their citation practices; b) for them the fact that a source is peer reviewed is the most important factor when deciding where to publish; c) they are more negative towards the use of repositories and social media for publishing and more skeptical about their potential for increasing usage or reaching a wider audience. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",""

Thus, it is uncertain whether changes in community-level factors, such as an increase in public library funding and service level, make a difference in an individual's library usage after differences in personal characteristics are accounted for. Applying the person-in-environment (PIE) framework designed to integrate individual agency and sociostructural factors in IB research, this study used structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the factors influencing a student's frequency of public library usage for schoolwork, leisure, and Internet access. It mapped and merged a nationally representative survey of 13,000 U.S. 12th graders with census tract data and public library statistics. The SEM findings indicate that school information environment, frequency of school library use, race/ethnicity, and home computer availability were among the top three factors affecting public library usage for schoolwork, leisure, and Internet access. More importantly, library service levels had a positive impact on students' library usage in terms of frequency of use. Specifically, even after personal differences such as each student's socioeconomic status and achievement motivation were controlled for, higher service levels in the student's neighborhood public library contributed to more frequent library usage. The findings pinpoint the benefits for individual-level IB study to incorporate etic measures of community-level factors.

Since this approach offers only limited assessments in absolute terms, it is difficult for decision-makers to track and improve overall performance. Therefore, the use of non-parametric frontier methods, namely free disposal hull (FDH) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) is presented as an alternative technique for benchmarking the performance of organizations in relative terms.

A total of 252,881 citations were analyzed in terms of count, domain name, and citing purposes. The results show that (a) in comparison to the disciplines in the control group, LIS articles in Chinese journals indicated a strong preference for citing Internet sources, and this preference is increasing; (b) LIS articles did not seem to discriminate against domain names when citing Internet sources; and (c) LIS articles cited more Internet sources as evidence to support research results and conclusions. Excessive dependency on Internet sources may raise concerns over the quality, research ethics, and credibility of research publications. Chinese LIS researchers should place more emphasis on the disadvantages of Internet sources as supporting material. Guidelines and criteria to help researchers, journal editors, students, and librarians assess information on the Web need to be developed. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",""

After changes were made to the instrument in 2003, however, no confirmatory factor analyses have been published in peer-reviewed journals affirming the three-factor structure of LibQUAL+®. These deficiencies were addressed by testing the hypothesized three-factor structure and the stability of that structure over time. Specifically, data from three samples (n = 550; n = 3261; n = 2103) were collected over a five-year period and analyzed using a multi-group confirmatory factor analysis. Results suggest that the theoretical model fit the data across the three samples and demonstrates factorial invariance over time. Multicollinearity between affect of service and information control, however, indicate that service quality may be measured as two dimensions rather than three, providing a more parsimonious explanation of service quality. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",""

To fill this gap, empirical data from a sample of Russian-speaking immigrant readers residing in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada, were collected and analyzed using an innovative combination of two previously disparate scholarships-immigration research and reading research. Reading is a contextually dependent experience, and these findings are situated in the context of acculturation attitudes of the ethnic readership in question. Immigration causes acculturation stress in the sphere of leisure reading and affects immigrant reading practices in numerous ways, including the types of chosen books, book selection criteria, and the methods of finding out about new titles and accessing items of interest. An in-depth and thorough understanding of leisure reading practices can improve insight into immigrant acculturation. Therefore, these findings and discussion will be valuable for librarians, LIS scholars, and reading researchers who interact with immigrant readers. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",""

The library cube consists of two major components: a backend system containing a multidimensional data warehouse linking student borrowing and use of electronic resources to students' academic marks (grades); and a frontend system that allows users to quickly and easily create cross tabulated data views, such as average student marks by frequency of library resource usage and gender. The project is different from the efforts of other institutions to link usage to student outcomes, in that the library cube is not an isolated research project, but is now an ongoing part of UOW's systems and performance reporting. The library cube represents a fundamental shift in evaluating the student experience through the integration of discrete systems and datasets. It has revealed a very strong relationship between student library usage and academic performance. This information will improve UOW library's ability to demonstrate value to clients and stakeholders. The library cube has also delivered some anticipated and unexpected findings on the relationship between social variables, such as gender, age, and citizenship, and library usage behaviors; and in doing so has also identified potential target audiences for library promotions and engagement strategies. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",""

The study uses structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the effects of different facets of job satisfaction on the task performance and contextual performance of university librarians. Specifically, the study breaks down the overall measure of job satisfaction first into its intrinsic and extrinsic components, and then into sub-facets of these components, in order to isolate in detail how they influence job performance. Findings from competing statistical models demonstrate that certain facets of intrinsic job satisfaction strongly predict both task performance and contextual performance. The findings can be particularly useful for providing a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between job satisfaction and job performance in the university library context. Finally, the study considers managerial implications. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",""

Hypotheses based on the two cultural models (individualism and context) were tested using a 2 × 2 factorial between-subject experimental design: individualism/collectivism and high/low-context conditions. The subjects consisted of 82 American students and 82 Korean students. The cultural tests confirm that the American culture represents individualism, whereas the Korean culture represents collectivism. The results indicate that Koreans tend to be more comfortable with a high-context culture that uses indirect and ambiguous messages. The Korean subjects show higher ratings for perceptions of information in a high-context design compared to the American subjects. There was no statistically significant difference in recall of information from high- and low-context conditions between the American and the Korean subjects.

The project included: (a) an audit of university IL practices; and (b) the administration of the James Madison University (JMU) Information Literacy Test (ILT) to 103 twelfth grade students in Alberta, Canada. Due to the low stakes of the test, there was concern about the reliability of the results. Rapid guessing, response time effort, and motivation filters were applied to confirm the reliability of the results. Results indicate a gap between expectations of high school students and their skills. Using a standardized test, potential incoming undergraduate IL proficiency was identified, including student strengths and weaknesses. The audit identified IL policies and practices at the university, indicating discrepancies in the IL instruction students may receive. Findings indicate that students lack the IL proficiency required to succeed in the post-secondary educational environment, and the libraries are not prepared to effectively address this gap. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",""

This research analyses the titles, abstracts, and keywords of forty years of articles in LIS-classified journals for trends related to computing technologies. The proportion of Scopus LIS articles mentioning some aspect of computing in their title, abstract, or keywords increased steadily from 1986 to 2000, then stabilised at about two thirds, indicating a continuing dominance of computers in most LIS research. Within this general trend, many computer-related terms have peaked and then declined in popularity. For example, the proportion of Scopus LIS article titles, abstracts, or keywords that included the terms ""computer"" or ""computing"" decreased fairly steadily from about 20% in 1975 to 5% in 2013, and the proportion explicitly mentioning the web peaked at 18% in 2002. Parallel analyses suggest that computing is substantially less important in two related disciplines: education and communication, and so it should be seen as a key aspect of the LIS identity. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",""

Drawing upon self-perception theory and the technology acceptance model (TAM), a research model is developed and tested using questionnaires and, partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modeling (SEM). The results suggest that the perceived tie by users between print resources and electronic resources positively moderates the transfer of ease of use from print to electronic, while negatively moderating the transfer of usefulness from print to electronic. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",""
