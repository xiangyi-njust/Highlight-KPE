"Organizational resilience and digital resources: Evidence from responding to exogenous shock by going virtual","2023","International Journal of Information Management","10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2023.102687","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165972202&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijinfomgt.2023.102687&partnerID=40&md5=111afc9871f79758a1733576592665d7","Recent events have renewed attention to how organizations rely on digital resources in response to exogenous shock. Though the literature on organizational resilience indicates that this is best understood as a process through which organizational actors respond to a specific shock, most IS research attends to resilience as an outcome. Against that backdrop, we present a case study of how a university shifted to virtual teaching in response to a government-imposed lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adopting a digital resourcing perspective allowed us to reveal the organizational resilience process and the way digital resources shaped it. We found that the resilience process unfolded in stages as educators, assisted by students, managers, and IT personnel pivoted, adapted, and normalized into teaching virtually. Across these stages, digital resources took on specific roles as the resilience process progressed from the organization's pre-shock accumulation of digital resources into its continued digitalization efforts. Based on these findings, we contribute to existing literature by advancing and empirically substantiating a process view of the role of digital resources in organizational resilience. © 2023 The Authors","COVID-19; Digital resources; Exogenous shock; Organizational resilience; Virtual teaching"
"A new perspective of BDA and information quality from final users of information: A multiple study approach","2023","International Journal of Information Management","10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2023.102683","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166628519&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijinfomgt.2023.102683&partnerID=40&md5=e67e23c631d2a7c650fe84d9dedee53f","Although organizational factors related to big data analytics (BDA) and its performance have been studied extensively, the number of failed BDA projects continues to rise. The quality of BDA information is a commonly cited factor in explanations for such failures and could prove key to improving project performance. Using the resource-based view (RBV) lens, data analytics literature, business strategy control, and an empirical setup of two studies based on marketing and information technology managerial data, we draw on the dimensions of the balanced scorecard (BSC) as an integrating framework of BDA organizational factors. Specifically, we tested a model –from two different perspectives– that would explain information quality through analytical talent and organizations' data plan alignment. Results showed that both managers have a different understanding of what information quality is. The characteristics that make marketing a better informer of information quality are identified. In addition, hybrid (embedded) type analyst placements are seen to achieve better performance. Moreover, we add greater theoretical rigour by incorporating the moderating effect of the use of big data analytics in companies. Finally, the BSC provided a greater causal understanding of the resources and capabilities within a data strategy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Balanced scorecard; Big data analytics; Information quality; Organizational factors; Strategic alignment"

The multi-disciplinary nature of current literature necessitates integrative insights on the topic. We thus undertake a two-pronged approach – bibliometric analysis followed by systematic review – to map the extant literature in a structured, objective, and quantitative way. We contribute to the literature as we (i) offer a classification of the literature in three clusters, namely ‘social media platforms, social collaboration and social marketing’, ‘social media platforms and crowdfunding, and ‘social media platforms and crowdsourcing’; (ii) analyze recent research development in each cluster, methodological development, countries co-authorship and evolution of research in the area; and (iii) propose a conceptual framework -accompanied by research propositions- that provides an overview of the literature at the intersection of social media platforms, various social entrepreneurial practices and their influence on the social enterprise performance. Our review culminates with numerous impactful research avenues for scholarly progression in the area. From a practical standpoint, this review integrates scattered findings into one body, allowing the practitioners and policymakers to discern the role of social media platforms in dealing with emerging societal problems and increasing operational efficiencies of social enterprises (SEs). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review of its kind, offering unique perspectives at the nexus of social media platforms and SE's performance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Bibliometric analysis; Literature review; Social entrepreneurship; Social media platforms"

Despite their growing prevalence, e-tailers face difficulties capitalising on this platform to enhance retail operations. This paper explores how SMLSs affect consumers' purchase intentions by exploring their motivations for participating in e-commerce SMLSs. To this end, we used the uses and gratifications (U&G) theory to explain how using SMLSs to satisfy consumers' needs could lead to high or low purchase intentions. It was done by collecting cross-sectional data from 795 consumers who have participated in e-commerce SMLSs. The data were analysed using partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Our findings revealed that people use SMLSs to satisfy their need for value, social identification, and the medium's attributes. Based on these findings, we show six configurations that lead to high or low purchase intentions and make corresponding theoretical propositions. Thus, our study contributes to the research and practice of using SMLSs for online shopping. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","E-commerce; Live stream; Social media; Social pricing; Uses and gratification"

While prior models of technology acceptance have identified several factors that influence behavioral intention and use behavior, trust has largely been missing in such models. This study incorporates e-government trust into the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model and conducts an empirical analysis using meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) methods on findings gathered from 90 prior studies on e-government. Results show that trust plays a central role in users’ intention to use and use of e-government systems. Specifically, in e-government contexts, trust is impacted by performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions; has a direct effect on system use; and an indirect effect on system use through behavioral intention. Practitioners should strive to leverage users’ trust to leverage the full potential of e-government systems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Behavioral intention; E-government; E-government trust; MASEM; Use behavior; UTAUT model"

By drawing on the transaction cost and stakeholder theories, Blockchain technology offers new opportunities to rethink the way in which stakeholders are organized and collaborate. Although Blockchain technology receives considerable attention from both the public and academia, the question of how Blockchain technology leverages patent management in particular has so far been neglected, although it holds great promise. Consequently, this is what we choose to be our basic research question. In response to it, we conduct a systematic literature review, following a procedure in three steps. Out of an initial sample of 714 articles, we select 52 as being particularly relevant, and classify them in accordance with the dimensions of the 7D Patent Management Maturity Model. Three main foci regarding the use of Blockchain technology emerge – i.e. for the generation, the enforcement, and the exploitation of patents. This study contributes to scholarship and management by showing that Blockchain technology mitigates environmental and behavioral uncertainty, while stimulating new governance forms and business models by reorganizing or discarding stakeholders. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain technology; Distributed ledger; Patent management; Stakeholder theory; Transaction cost theory"

FinTech platforms use a combination of technologies to digitalize processes and introduce new business models with unique characteristics. The benefits of FinTech initiatives are not limited to boosting the economic development of emerging economies; they also have a transformative impact on society and stakeholders. The transformative impact enables the democratization of digital services, making them accessible to marginalized groups that the traditional financial banking system has excluded. Our study theorizes how FinTech organizational capabilities (digital technologies, digital infrastructures, and talented employees) and FinTech ecosystem conditions (competitors, regulations, digital gender gaps, and institutional gaps) impact inclusion, transparency, and market expansion inspired by transformative entrepreneurship. We tested it through a multilevel analysis using data from 333 worldwide large FinTech platforms combined with secondary data at the country level. Results provide insights into how digital infrastructure, a skilled workforce, and closing the gaps for disadvantaged groups are crucial determinant factors for increasing FinTech impacts in emerging economies. Several implications for entrepreneurs, society, and policymakers emerge as a call for fostering digital societies and FinTech industry in emerging economies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Emerging economies; FinTech platforms; Transformational entrepreneurship; Transformational impacts"

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine goals and design strategies that contribute to the successful execution of open data hackathons and innovation competitions. Six case studies of open data hackathons and innovation competitions held between 2014 and 2018 in Thessaloniki have been explored to understand the co-ordination between the multiple stakeholders of these events and improve the execution of open data hackathons and innovation competitions. The outcomes indicate that the most critical design strategy was the involvement of mentors in the event and the level of support provided to nascent entrepreneurs to accelerate their creativity, develop applications and launch their prototypes on the market. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Digital technologies; Entrepreneurship ecosystem; Innovation; Open data hackathons; Start-ups"

How organizations may achieve ambidexterity for innovations in the public sector characterized by unique constraints has been largely underexplored. Platforms have emerged as key components in organizations’ approaches to innovation. Using an empirical study in a public sector organization, this study identifies a platform-based approach that can be used to achieve ambidexterity in balancing exploitative and exploratory innovations in the public sector. Organizations facing constraints pertaining to structure, risk, and value may benefit from considering their product/service development, process management, and value formulation through this approach. This study also identifies practices in platform development, appropriation, and control that contributed to the success of the platform-based approach. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Ambidexterity; Case study; Innovation; Platform; Public sector"

Such need creates the base for misinformation to spread within and outside the affected community. This may result in misinformation harms that can generate serious short term or long-term consequences. In such situations, there is a need for a joint human-machine effort to mitigate misinformation. Though there has been research in the area of management of AI in the recent past, there has been scarce work in examining situations where machines and humans interact for mitigating misinformation. In order to systematically analyze misinformation and suggest mechanisms for mitigation, we draw on Activity Theory to conceptualize a suitable framework. Such a framework will enable investigating human-machine interactions through loops of “misinformation generation” and “misinformation mitigation” activities for mitigating misinformation harms. The paper also validates the framework using three different target audiences, undergraduates, graduates and professionals. © 2023","Activity Theory; Harms; Human-Machine Interaction; Humanitarian Crises; Misinformation"

In user experience (UX) based design innovation, user-generated data and archived design documents are two valuable resources for various design activities such as identifying opportunities and generating design ideas. However, these two resources are usually isolated in different systems. Additionally, design information typically represented based on functional aspects is limited for UX-oriented design. To facilitate experience-oriented design activities, we propose a twin data-driven approach to integrate UX data and archived design documents. In particular, we aim to extract UX concepts from product reviews and design concepts from patents respectively and to discover associations between the extracted concepts. First, a UX-integrated design information representation model is proposed to associate capabilities with key elements of UX at the concept, category, and aspect levels of information. Based on this model, a twin data-driven approach is developed to bridge experience information and design information. It contains three steps: experience aspect identification using an attention-based LSTM (Long short-term memory) network, design information categorization based on topic clustering using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and LAD (Latent Dirichlet allocation) model, and experience needs and design information integration by leveraging word embedding techniques to measure concept similarity.

Evidence of data bias in crisis information management (CIM) remains scattered despite its potentially significant impact on crisis response. To understand what biases emerge in complex crises and how they affect CIM, we conducted a combined interview and document analysis study. Focusing on the largest humanitarian crisis in the world, i.e., the conflict in Yemen, we conducted 25 interviews with managers and analysts of response organizations, and assessed 47 reports and datasets created by response organizations in Yemen. We find evidence of a cycle of bias reinforcement through which bias cascades between field, headquarters and donor levels of crisis response. Researchers, as well as practitioners, need to consider these underlying biases and reinforcement loops because they influence what data can be collected when, by whom, from whom, and how the data is shared and used. To the CIM literature, we contribute an in-depth understanding of how four types of data bias emerge in crises: political, accessibility, topical, and sampling bias. © 2023 The Authors","Crisis information management; Data bias; Humanitarian response; Interviews, document analysis"

The study is premised on transformational entrepreneurship theory that enables a focus on the societal changes that have resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. A semi-structured in-depth interview approach was utilised to understand how farm entrepreneurs perceived the digital platform and how this contributed to transformational entrepreneurship outcomes. The study is amongst the first to incorporate a digital platform, farm entrepreneurship, transformational entrepreneurship and COVID-19 perspective. The findings suggest that farm entrepreneurs are driven by financial, social and community goals during a crisis that influences their usage of digital platforms. As a consequence, the findings contribute to managerial practice and policy debate by highlighting the way digital platforms can be used in times of crisis to produce transformational entrepreneurship outcomes. © 2022","Crisis events; Digital platforms; Digitalization; Entrepreneurship; Farm entrepreneurship; Rural entrepreneurship; Transformational entrepreneurship"

As a primary AI tool, chatbots have seen increasing use by companies to support customer service. An understanding of how chatbots are used is essential for improving customer service. Based on the relevant literature, this study examined the impacts of chatbot-enabled agility (namely, internal and external chatbot agility) on customer service performance and explored the antecedents from the perspective of information technology use (both routine and innovative use). We collected data from 294 U.S. marketing employees from various industries, using a survey for the assessment of our research model. The results showed that both routine and innovative use of chatbots were positively related to internal and external agility. In particular, the innovative use of chatbots plays an important role in creating business agility. Moreover, internal and external agility are positively related to customer service performance. Through a close look at chatbots and their use, our study provides insight into the role of AI in creating business agility. Practically speaking, this study suggests that both the routine and the innovative use of chatbots should be encouraged to create agility and develop business sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Agility; Artificial intelligence; Chatbot; Customer service; Dynamic capabilities; Innovative use; Routine use"

Even if people are aware of the problem and want to change their energy consumption, they have difficulty acting on their attitudes. This is called the attitude-behavior gap. To narrow this gap and reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions, behavioral interventions beyond technological advances must be considered. A promising intervention is nudging, which uses insights from behavioral economics to gently nudge individuals toward more sustainable choices. In this study, we investigate how modifying digital choice architectures with nudges can be used to influence consumer energy conservation behavior in smart home applications (SHAs). We conducted an online experiment with 391 participants to test the effectiveness of the following three digital nudges in an SHA: self-commitment, reminder, and social norm nudge. While the results of a structural equation model indicated no effect on bridging the gap between attitude and behavior, we found the potential to promote energy conservation with two nudge types. Thus, this paper makes substantial contribution to persuasive and information systems-enabled sustainability for a better world in the form of digital nudges for emerging technologies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Attitude-behavior gap; Digital nudging; Green information systems; Smart home"

Extant research suggests that very quickly, individuals become disinterested and begin avoiding the information. In this study, we investigate how an individual's fear and situational motivation impact Online Information Avoidance. Using the self-determination theory and information avoidance theories, we argue that fear and external regulation are associated with increased Online Information Avoidance.

We must broadly and distinctively identify the practices enacted in the organizational use of social technologies, understand how these practices influence each other, and the mechanisms driving their achievement. This paper deduces the sociomaterial practices enacted in the organizational use of social media and the augmenting generative capabilities. We surveyed seventy-three (73) organizations, collected 267 usable responses and applied structural equation modelling (SEM) techniques to analyze the data. The paper offers two contributions. First, we utilize the affordances-in-practice perspective to identify and categorize organizational practices enacted on social media, including functional, symbolic, and interactive practices. Then, we highlight the role of organizational generativity in facilitating these practices. Generativity represents the ability to revitalize, procreate, and introduce new ways of acting in dynamic or transient situations. Overall, our findings show how social media practices relate to organizational generativity and the mediating role of symbolic-driven practices. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Generativity; Practice; Social interaction; Social media; Sociomateriality; Symbolic expressions; Technology affordances"

Using a big data-driven approach, we collected over 42 million tweets during Hurricane Harvey and obtained 3589 original verified real or false tweets by cross-checking with fact-checking websites and a relevant federal agency. Our results show that virality is higher for misinformation, novel tweets, and tweets with negative sentiment or lower lexical density. In addition, we reveal the opposite impacts of sentiment on the virality of real news versus misinformation. We also find that tweets on the environment are less likely to go viral than the baseline religious news, while real social news tweets are more likely to go viral than misinformation on social news. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Hurricane; Information Veracity; Information virality; Misinformation; Twitter"

One application of AI that has increasingly been applied is algorithmic grading. It is within this context that our study takes a focus on trust. While the concept of trust continues to grow in importance among AI researchers and practitioners, an investigation of trust/mistrust in algorithmic grading across multiple levels of analysis has so far been under-researched. In this paper, we argue the need for a model that encompasses the multi-layered nature of trust/mistrust in AI. Drawing on an embedded agency perspective, a model is devised that examines top-down and bottom-up forces that can influence trust/mistrust in algorithmic grading. We illustrate how the model can be applied by drawing on the case of the International Baccalaureate (IB) program in 2020, whereby an algorithm was used to determine student grades. This paper contributes to the AI-trust literature by providing a fresh theoretical lens based on institutional theory to investigate the dynamic and multi-faceted nature of trust/mistrust in algorithmic grading—an area that has seldom been explored, both theoretically and empirically. The study raises important implications for algorithmic design and awareness. Algorithms need to be designed in a transparent, fair, and ultimately a trustworthy manner. While an algorithm typically operates like a black box, whereby the underlying mechanisms are not apparent to those impacted by it, the purpose and an understanding of how the algorithm works should be communicated upfront and in a timely manner. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Algorithmic grading; Embedded agency; Mistrust; Multi-level analysis; Trust"

This study aims to fill this important gap and beyond. We derive a model of discontinuance intention (DI) where job satisfaction is a prominent mediator of the effect of reward fairness. We further theorize and test how and why on-demand workers’ dual commitments toward their online communities arising from workers’ informal social interactions (ISI) may create boundary conditions for the mediating role of job satisfaction. Data were collected from a large sample of 1493 on-demand workers over a four-year span and facilitated the analysis of a moderated mediation model. Results indicate that job satisfaction largely mediates a negative relationship between workers’ perceptions that their rewards are just (i.e., fairness of rewards) and their intention to discontinue work for the on-demand firm. Moreover, workers’ dual commitments toward their online peer communities (OPCs) disrupted this mediating effect. More interestingly, the dual commitments did not moderate the mediation path equally.

Open data researchers have examined the importance of data publication by public bodies, but in contrast, much less attention has focused on how open data is exploited. In this paper, we aim to provide insight into the actions of platforms to assist open data exploitation by transformational entrepreneurs, which systemically facilitate transformation in socio-economic development. Our findings investigate two types of mechanism, reflecting the openness of the data movement and the competitive commercial need for closure. First, inclusion mechanisms are social mechanisms of the open data ecosystem which seek to attract a broad range of potential collaborators through supporting entrepreneurs to innovate with open data. Second, exclusion mechanisms are deployed to filter collaborators, to identify those who are seen by platforms to be more likely to successfully exploit their data, or develop revenue sharing relationships. We reveal how these mechanisms are used at different stages of the innovation process, to initially attract a wide pool of collaborators, before seeking to reduce them to better target limited resources. Despite ‘openness’ being a key requirement of open data publication, for successful transformational entrepreneur exploitation, it requires dimensions of closure. © 2023","Digital innovation; Open data; Platforms; Transformational entrepreneurship"

We integrate size of investment – the amount of time, effort, and other personal resources that an individual has put into their online account. Based on PMT's framework, we develop a research model that examines the influence of investment size as an information source that initiates and builds threat and coping appraisals. The model is tested with a survey of 263 responses, and the result shows that investment size influences threat and coping appraisals, which in turn increases MFA protection motivation and use.

Among emerging digital technologies, digital platforms are shaping and outgrowing the e-commerce channel representing a potential opportunity for manufacturing SMEs to embrace digital transformation. Drawing on affordance theory, this research uses a mixed method approach to investigate how manufacturing SMEs’ e-commerce commitment and digital platform adoption stimulate the actualization of three e-commerce affordances: consumer knowledge generation, internationalization, and customer diversification. Based on survey responses from 165 manufacturing SME managers, we find that direct selling through owned websites actualizes consumer knowledge generation and internationalization, indirect selling actualizes customer diversification and internationalization, and agency selling through third-party platforms actualizes all three affordances. The relationship between e-commerce commitment and ecommerce performance is mediated by consumer knowledge generation and internationalization but not by customer diversification. A fsQCA analysis outlines seven configurations actualizing these e-commerce affordances by pairing different ecommerce approaches with degrees of e-commerce commitment. Finally, an analysis of open-ended questions from 24 respondents complements the study and deeply interprets the seven unique configurations outlined. © 2023 The Authors","Affordance theory; Digital platforms; e-commerce; fsQCA; mixed method; Transformational entrepreneurship"

Using the theoretical lens of relationship cultivation and social media engagement, we collected 55,358 original Weibo posts by 90 farms and other AFN participants in China and used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling for topic analysis. We then used the literature to map the topics with constructs and developed a theoretical model. To validate the theoretical model, a panel dataset was constructed on Weibo account and year level, with Chinese city-level yearly economic data included as control variables. A fixed effects panel data regression analysis was performed. The empirical results revealed that posts centered on openness/disclosure, sharing of tasks, and knowledge sharing result in positive levels of social media engagement. Posting about irrelevant information and advertising that uses repetitive wording in multiple posts had negative effects on engagement. Our findings suggest that cultivating engagement requires different relationship strategies, and social media platforms should be leveraged according to the context and the purpose of the social cause.

Previous studies on digital transformation and SMEs focus on technology adoption, innovation, new value creation, and dynamic capabilities. However, it is unclear how digital technology affects SMEs' specific business activities. We study SMEs' customer access, increasing competition, external funding or access to finance, rising input costs, skilled labor shortages, exogenous shocks, global crises, and regulatory issues. This study aims to fill the literature gap by exploring the impact of digital technology, using digital economy and society index (DESI) as proxies for the SME issues. We use DESI and SME data from a survey on European enterprises’ access to finance. We find that digital transformation strengthens SMEs' ability and flexibility to address main business issues. Furthermore, findings reveal that digitally transformed SMEs have fewer concerns about access to new and traditional customers, competition changes, access to finance, increasing input costs, external shocks, and regulatory changes. However, digital transformation also brings risks, such as the shortage of skilled labor and experienced managers and loss of inherent competitiveness. The novelty of our work lies in supplying quantitative knowledge on the link between digital transformation and European SMEs' critical business concerns.

Borrowing assorted perspectives from retailing, virtual reality, and neuromarketing literature, we extended the stimulus-organism-response framework to evaluate how unplanned behavior evolves through conscious and unconscious measures. We found that consumers’ impulsiveness was significantly associated with their unplanned expenditure and the number of unplanned purchases. Using mediation analysis, we observed that flow experience during shopping partially mediated the relationship between the sense of presence and the desire to stay longer in a virtual shopping store. Desire to stay in the virtual store positively influenced store satisfaction, basket-size deviation, and budget deviation.

Our findings show that perceived transparency of a business's privacy practices has a positive effect on customers’ commitment to the business, while perceived control exerts a negative effect on commitment. These effects are mediated by customers’ information falsification rather than disclosure, because the former is a sensitive behavioral indicator of privacy concerns. The results also reveal the moderating roles of government support. This research contributes to the customer data privacy literature by demonstrating the distinct effects of perceived transparency and control on commitment and revealing the underlying mechanism.

Prior studies have applied Big Five (Big5) and Dark Tetrads (Dark4) personality traits (PTs) along with demographic attributes, using symmetrical modelling, but revealed mixed and inconsistent results. This paper applies an asymmetric modelling approach using complexity and configurational theories to develop configurations of PTs and demography to predict CB. The online survey data have been analyzed using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) technique. Regarding Big5 PTs, our findings reveal that, for instance, people scoring high in conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness and low in agreeableness undertake cyberbullying. For Dark4 PTs, the combination of either psychopathy and sadism or Machiavellianism and psychopathy leads to cyberbullying. As for demographic attributers, educated young married people, irrespective of gender, are likely to commit cyberbullying. Our all-inclusive model reveals that social media bullies, regardless of their gender, marital status, and social media experience, are young, educated, neurotic, conscientious, psychopathic, and sadistic with high Machiavellianism and low agreeableness.

Previous research on social participation in older adults has typically focused on specific activities or failed to distinguish between different forms of participation. In contrast, we propose that social participation is a resource optimization process for older adults, where various forms of participation must be optimized in order to improve well-being outcomes. Drawing on Selective Optimization with Compensation theory, we develop hypotheses on how older adults with cognitive decline select and optimize their social participation profile and how multiple modes of participation synergistically affect their perceived loneliness. Using data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), we test a polynomial model and find that online social participation has a U-shaped effect on loneliness, while personal-oriented offline social participation mitigates this effect. We also find that the impact of social participation modes varies considerably between younger and older groups. Our findings suggest implications for the design of integrative aging support programs and the use of ICT to promote mental well-being in different stages of advanced age. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","CLSA; Loneliness; Older adults; Online social participation; Polynomial modeling"

Moreover, segmentation is limited to sales promotions in marketing. Although needs-based segmentation considering customer sentiments on product features can be conducted to develop a new product concept, it cannot identify commonalities among customers owing to their diverse preferences. Therefore, this paper proposes an interpretable machine learning-based approach for customer segmentation for new product development based on the importance of product features from online product reviews. The technical challenges of determining the importance of product features in each review are identifying and interpreting the nonlinear relations between satisfaction with product features and overall customer satisfaction. In this study, interpretable machine learning is used to identify these nonlinear relations with high performance and transparency. A case study on a wearable device is conducted to validate the proposed approach. Customer segmentation using the proposed approach based on importance is compared with that employing a previous approach based on sentiments. The results show that the proposed approach presents a higher clustering performance than the previous approach and offers opportunities to identify new product concepts. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Customer segmentation; Explainable artificial intelligence; Online review mining; Product planning; Text mining"

Using the information theory lens and knowledge-based view and a two-study empirical setup based on data from manufacturing and services firms, we draw on the Competence–Capability–Performance (CCP) framework. Specifically, we test a model of digitalization circuitry operational through the mediating effects of virtual integration and dynamic strategic planning (DSP).

Specifically, the use of idealized women's bodies in different sectors of promotion and on social media has been subject to much criticism. The awareness of the negative outcomes of objectifying content triggered movements towards natural body exposure. However, empirical studies on the perceived effectiveness of this use are still needed. In this article, we compare how idealized versus natural women's bodies are perceived by Instagram users by means of an experimental procedure conducted with 700 users of this platform. We apply the Mann-Whitney U test and PLS-SEM to evaluate how physical attractiveness and idealization are related to the objectifying gazes. Our results suggest that overall publishing potentially objectifying content online is an accepted behavior, especially for more active Instagram users. Besides, both extremes of attractiveness, i.e. idealized beauty and perceived lack of attractiveness are subjected to stronger objectifying, than more natural-looking models. Thus, our paper contributes theoretically and empirically to the research on objectification by extending our knowledge of the factors that drive objectification and its acceptance among social media users.

Drawing on supervisor monitoring literature and conservation of resource theory, this study proposes two types of gig platform monitoring (observational monitoring and interactional monitoring) and builds a moderated mediation model to analyze how these platform monitoring methods impact gig workers’ cognitive work engagement. PLS-SEM analysis of data from 269 time-lagged surveys from gig workers shows that, through the mediation of affective trust, observational monitoring is negatively and interactional monitoring is positively related to cognitive work engagement. Furthermore, interactional but not observational monitoring is positively related to cognitive work engagement through the mediation of affective commitment, and method control can enhance the positive relationship between affective trust and cognitive work engagement. These findings contribute to the literature on the nature of gig platform monitoring and its impacts on gig workers’ cognitive work engagement by differentiating observational and interactional monitoring.

Additionally, many competitive digital transformation solutions on the market cause confusion when enterprises must choose one. This study drew a new information error-driven T-spherical fuzzy cloud algorithm to evaluate digital transformation solutions of entrepreneurial SMEs and support its selection. First, an evaluation index system for the digital transformation solution of entrepreneurial SMEs was established from four aspects. Then, a new concept of a T-spherical fuzzy cloud was defined to represent the evaluation information of the indicators. Additionally, a T-spherical Fuzzy Cloud Weighted Heronian Mean (T-SFCWHM) operator was used to aggregate the evaluation information. Afterward, an evaluation and selection decision framework for the digital transformation solution of entrepreneurial SMEs based on the T-SFCWHM operator was developed.

Information management of perfect-order estimation is frequently reduced to expert estimates and to the multiplication of probabilities of failure-free performance of some logistics operations. Moreover, perfect-order estimation is calculated without consideration of supply chain structure, possible combinations of failures, and operational policies (e.g., safety stock levels and alternative transportation routes). As a result, the existing methods frequently provide different estimates for the same statistics and cannot be consistently used in the allocation of companies’ resources to improve the order fulfilment process. This paper considers different variants of probabilistic assessment of a perfect order and proposes an approach to assess the impact of changes in parameter probabilities and number of parameters on the value of a perfect order. The proposed models are based on an analytical approach using discrete distributions of random variables. We illustrate the applicability of our approach to several numerical examples to confirm the adequacy of the proposed method.

However, at least in remote work, the crisis-driven digital transformation (e.g., during the COVID-19 pandemic) shows that almost all knowledge work processes can be virtualized unexpectedly and immediately. Since the requirements for these processes remain the same and need to be met to continue the processes remotely, an interesting question arises of how information technology (IT) can help to meet these requirements in a crisis-driven digital transformation of knowledge work. To address this question, we conducted 40 semi-structured interviews with a multiple-case approach using a critical realist perspective. Our findings contribute to information systems (IS) research in a twofold way. First, we demonstrate that the crisis-driven digital transformation of knowledge work triggers a revisited perspective on PVT by turning virtualized knowledge work processes into a prerequisite.

However, the mechanisms underpinning EA benefit realisation are not fully understood and have only relatively recently begun to receive research attention. Based on twenty-two expert interviews and two in-depth case studies, this theory building paper develops a new EA Benefit Mechanisms Model (the EABMM). It argues that EA benefits depend on the quality of EA service provision and are realised through three key mechanisms. First, EA helps improve IS decision-making by creating a transparent and structured decision process, by providing objective information to inform decisions, and by educating decision makers on good IS investment practices. Second, EA services help improve IS project delivery by improving project coordination through contextual awareness and by accelerating projects through guiding standards. Finally, EA services help an organisation to improve its IS platform by increasing platform alignment with business needs, platform flexibility, IS resource utilisation, and IS resource complementarity. Each of these three benefit mechanisms ultimately contributes to organisational benefits from EA, including higher return on IT investment, increased organisational agility, and competitive differentiation.

Many electricity suppliers are engaged in efforts to monetize this transition with ‘green’ services and products, such as Green Electricity Tariffs. These promise customers that their supply includes a specific share of green electricity, yet since electricity suppliers often fail to deliver on those promises, many customers have lost trust in their suppliers. Further information asymmetries may not only exacerbate this loss of trust, but also spark distrust and lead to an overall feeling of ambivalence. Eventually, ambivalent customers may feel inclined to switch suppliers. To prevent this domino effect, electricity suppliers must eliminate ambivalence by increasing customer trust and reducing customer distrust. Here, we discuss how these challenges can be met with a customer loyalty program built on blockchain technology. We developed the program following a Design Science Research approach that facilitated refinement in four iteration and evaluation cycles. Our results indicate that the developed customer loyalty program restores trust, reduces distrust, and resolves customer ambivalence by providing four features: improved customer agency, sufficient and verifiable information, appropriate levels of usability, and unobstructed data access. © 2022 The Authors","Ambivalence; Blockchain; Customer loyalty; Design Science ResearchDistrust; Trust"

Research indicates that there is a tradeoff between their model performance and explainability. Machine learning models with higher performance are often based on more complex algorithms and therefore lack explainability and vice versa. However, there is little to no empirical evidence of this tradeoff from an end user perspective. We aim to provide empirical evidence by conducting two user experiments. Using two distinct datasets, we first measure the tradeoff for five common classes of machine learning algorithms. Second, we address the problem of end user perceptions of explainable artificial intelligence augmentations aimed at increasing the understanding of the decision logic of high-performing complex models. Our results diverge from the widespread assumption of a tradeoff curve and indicate that the tradeoff between model performance and explainability is much less gradual in the end user's perception.

Most are based on data-driven business models, particularly relying on machine learning technologies. However, not all start-ups that use machine learning technologies manage to create and capture value. The existing literature on the use value enabled by information technologies does not take into account the unique capabilities of machine learning. The theory of data network effects offers a promising explanation of how to create value using machine learning. However, it does not explicitly describe how to capture value using machine learning. In contrast, business model theory explains how companies use technologies to create and capture value, but not specifically through the use of machine learning technology. Therefore, this study aims to improve the theoretical understanding of the key drivers of value creation and capture in start-ups with business models driven by this kind of technology. Statistical techniques are used in a sample of 122 start-ups to explore the theoretical relationships between these two theories. The analysis reveals the link between specific value creation and capture factors of the two theories, such as efficiency, novelty, and performance expectancy. The study also provides evidence of the need to adopt a co-evolutionary perspective of value creation and capture through the use of machine learning. © 2023","Business model; Data network effect; Machine learning; Start-up; Twitter"

Due to its importance, scholars called for studies to expand our knowledge in this critical area. This paper identifies, extracts, and assesses the most critical factors that influence the implementation of AI systems. This study identifies nineteen factors and categorizes them into four categories: organization, technology, process, and environment. The analytical hierarchy process is used to evaluate the factors and the categories. The analysis offers two types of results, at the category level and the level of the factors. The results indicate that technology is the most significant of the four categories. The results also suggest that ethics is the most crucial factor among all nineteen factors.

However, the majority of digital start-ups fail to scale, despite their potential to achieve growth. Moreover, what constitutes growth is significantly different for start-ups as compared with established firms: they have limited financial performance, and their growth cannot be accurately measured by metrics such as customers, revenues, profits, and turnover at the early stages of the new venture creation process or before the start-up has reached sustainability. Therefore, the first objective of this research is to contribute to the definition of growth by examining less tangible dimensions of growth. Moreover, the second objective is to identify the characteristics of early-stage digital start-ups experiencing growth. Based on a mixed-methods approach, which combines an adapted Delphi study, a questionnaire-based survey, and a comparative case study, our results suggest that growing digital start-ups exhibit a set of characteristics that include: an agile culture combining clan with adhocracy; the ability to nurture their absorptive, innovative, and adaptive capabilities effectively; and a human capital with adequate entrepreneurial skills, emotional attachment to and fitness with the start-up. © 2021 The Authors","Capabilities; Culture; Digital innovation; Entrepreneurship; Growth; Mixed methods; Start-ups"

However, current consumers may be reluctant to accept AI for such tasks. This research investigates the impact of required warmth to conduct a task on consumer acceptance of AI service and the moderating role of AI-human collaboration. A series of choice-based conjoint experiments and one survey yield two main findings. First, consumers tend to refuse AI for tasks that require high warmth due to the low perceived fit between AI and the task at hand. Second, an AI-human collaboration of AI supporting a human employee increases consumer acceptance of AI service for tasks that require high warmth. This is not the case for AI-human collaboration in which AI performs a task that is supervised by a human employee. Theoretically, this study increases our understanding of how consumer acceptance of AI service varies across tasks and how AI-human collaboration can advance AI acceptance.

As knowledge is a valuable asset in IT development, knowledge sharing between vendors and business clients becomes critical. However, the motivation behind IT vendors’ willingness to share knowledge with client firms is not sufficiently understood. To shed light on the nature of knowledge sharing within vendor–client partnerships, we examine the influence of performance feedback and managerial mindset on vendors’ motivation to share knowledge with their clients. We adopt a multi-method approach involving both a scenario-based field experiment with 164 vendor managers (Study 1) and a field survey of 112 vendor managers involved in IT development (Study 2). We find that when vendors’ performance exceeds their aspiration levels, they are motivated to share knowledge with clients. Such motivational effects are more pronounced for vendor managers exhibiting abstract mindsets. Our study is of significant value to researchers and practitioners, affording both groups a keener, deeper, and more robust appreciation for how knowledge sharing in vendor–client partnerships can be managed more effectively. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Information technology (IT); Knowledge sharing; Vendor–client partnership"

The study investigates how the focus on knowledge exploitation by SMEs limits innovation which can be reconciled using cloud computing by creating multiple ambidextrous knowledge opportunities. In relation to cloud computing and knowledge ambidexterity, the study is the first to measure the effects of a temporal lag in the K-AMB processes resulting in enhanced employee-driven innovation. The results showed that over a 12-month period, employee-driven innovation was significantly amplified from the application of cloud computing that supported more sophisticated ambidextrous processes of knowledge management. The results significantly shift mindsets about the revelatory value of cloud computing to promote K-AMB in SMEs.

Despite considerable work devoted to suppressing fake news, health misinformation, including low-quality health news, persists and even increases in recent years. One promising approach to fighting bad information is studying the temporal and sentiment effects of health news stories and how they are discussed and disseminated on social media platforms like Twitter. As part of the effort of searching for innovative ways to fight health misinformation, this study analyzes a dataset of more than 1600 objectively and independently reviewed health news stories published over a 10-year span and nearly 50,000 Twitter posts responding to them. Specifically, it examines the source credibility of health news circulated on Twitter and the temporal, sentiment features of the tweets containing or responding to the health news reports. The results show that health news stories that are rated low by experts are discussed more, persist longer, and produce stronger sentiments than highly rated ones in the tweetosphere. However, the highly rated stories retained a fresh interest in the form of new tweets for a longer period. An in-depth understanding of the characteristics of health news distribution and discussion is the first step toward mitigating the surge of health misinformation.

However, research studies on the consumers' impact of privacy concerns on review behaviors are sparse. This study aims to fill the gap by investigating consumers' privacy concerns in writing negative reviews. Specifically, this study examines the effects of two types of privacy concerns, online privacy concerns and physical privacy concerns, on the intention to provide negative reviews and contingent factors (monetary incentive, venting negative feelings, and warning other consumers) that could influence this relationship. The study also examines the effectiveness of two fair information practices (i.e., privacy policy and anonymous feature) in mitigating privacy concerns.

The proposed model is validated using the partial least squares method. Results show that perceived coupon value (PCV) and situational product involvement (SPI) positively influence redeeming and sharing intentions. In addition, PCV is positively affected by economic benefit, perception of others, informativeness of ratings and reviews, and vividness of reviews, whereas SPI is positively affected by economic benefit, social presence of web, informativeness of ratings and reviews, and vividness of reviews.

To comprehensively evaluate the development status of Chinese manufacturing enterprises’ servitization level and explore the heterogeneity effect of digital transformation on enterprise servitization level, this study conducts the following research. By analyzing the influencing factors of manufacturing SMEs’ servitization level and the mechanism of digital transformation, this study combines the panel data of SMEs in manufacturing from 2015 to 2020 and evaluates their servitization levels from static and dynamic perspectives using super-efficiency data envelopment analysis (DEA) and Malmquist index methods. Furthermore, this study examines the influence of digital transformation on the servitization level of SMEs in manufacturing by using a digital input index and scenario comparison and analyzes the heterogeneous effects according to industry type. The results show that the servitization level of Chinese SMEs in manufacturing is not high, and its development is not balanced. Digital transformation plays a significant role in promoting the servitization of SMEs in manufacturing. The effect has obvious heterogeneity owing to differences in industry type.

However, researchers seldom study “post-release activities” that are crucial for maintaining and advancing those goods. This article elaborates on the challenging nature of post-release activities for crowdfunding initiatives, asking how developers communicate their post-release plans to effectively prepare backers for possible changes. Using a grounded approach that connects the longitudinal history of fundraising to development to post-release, I examine initiatives that achieved impressive fundraising and development results yet varied significantly in their post-release outcomes. While they consistently signaled post-release plans, the differences are the signals’ costs, backers' reactions, and the post-release activities and outcomes. I present theoretical propositions that (1) developers benefit in the long run by combining high-cost signaling with engaging backers in follow-up conversations about post-release issues and (2) prospective backers can utilize developers' communication to identify their post-release signals. Unlike dominant research findings about signals’ impacts on mobilizing resources during fundraising, the findings emphasize signals’ post-release consequences for stakeholders. While different signaling approaches can enhance short-term performance, they also seed contrasting longer-term outcomes for developers, backers, and the industry.

Drawing on signaling theory and the results of two experimental studies with 151 and 152 participants, respectively, we investigate how the use of blockchain to trace food products impacts consumers’ perception of product quality as a mediating variable and subsequently their purchase intention. Our framework further considers brand familiarity as a moderating variable. The findings from the two experiments show that blockchain labels as a signaling mechanism in food supply chains help to strengthen consumers’ perceived quality of food products, which, in turn, increases their purchase intention. This effect is more pronounced for less familiar brands, which is valuable information for managers who want to build a brand's reputation.

Conceptually, the study identifies the potential sources of tacit knowledge development by individuals. That is, the study examines how “learning by doing” and “learning by interaction” lead to a willingness to share knowledge and, as a consequence, to support process and product/service innovation. This study empirically demonstrates that tacit knowledge internalization and externalization (awareness and sharing) significantly mediate between tacit knowledge experimentation and socialization (acquisition) and its final combination (knowledge in action). While such theoretical assumptions already exist, they have not yet been empirically explained and revealed in a single structural model. Further, this empirical approach enabled a demonstration that internalization and externalization of tacit knowledge may occur consciously or unconsciously with equal success. Even so, the study also showed conscious tacit knowledge's greater impact on innovation. Therefore, an organizational effort to manage autonomous, informal, and strongly contextual tacit knowledge is worthwhile and creates the capacity for superior competitive advantage. Finally, this study also demonstrates that national context influences tacit knowledge acquisition. In the US, “learning by doing” is dominant, whereas in Poland, “learning by interaction” and critical thinking are more common.

Yet, the literature lacks empirical studies on how AI assimilation could lead to improved organizational outcomes such as organizational agility, customer agility and firm performance. This study is an initial attempt to fill this research gap. It draws on the dynamic capability view and the available studies on AI to investigate the impacts of AI assimilation (AIASS) on firm performance (FPERF). Then, it assesses the mediating effects of organizational agility (ORGAG) and customer agility (CUSTAG) on the relationship between the AIASS and FPERF.

While digital platforms can help to connect the possessors of resources with the entrepreneurs who need them, the mediating processes that those who are not directly represented in such digital spaces need to undergo deserve further attention. This study builds on social identity theory and the identity-based view by considering identity as a relational and resource construct and discussing three identity mediation processes and strategies: connection-, familiarity-, and credibility-building. The evidence for this study was sourced from Rang De, India's first digital micro credit platform.

The loss of awareness that flow state may bring can lead to the purchase of products that consumers afterward regret and want to return them. This research aims to understand flow consciousness's effect on consumer post-purchase regret from a dual perspective (process and outcome regret). The relevance of these relationships is also examined by analyzing the differences between 2 groups: maximizers and satisficers consumers. Through a structural equation model based on covariances tested with EQS 6.4, the results show that flow consciousness generates process regret but not outcome regret. However, the differences found between the two groups are worth noting. The research sheds light on the effect of flow consciousness on regret and provides insight into the mechanism of product return through post-purchase regret.

To increase alliance performance, organizations in a strategic alliance are more likely to interpret each other's equivocal behaviors in a positive way to sustain the stability of the relationship. Different from traditional mechanisms to build interorganizational trust, blockchain facilitates trust among alliance partners via its technology advantages, for example, public ledger and distributed consensus. The decentralized and distributed nature of a blockchain-based system assures that no single organization can add information to the chain without an approval from the alliance, nor can it make unilateral changes in the system. Drawing from the Affordance Theory, we propose an exploratory research design to understand the structure of a blockchain-based system, as well as how this blockchain-based system influences interorganizational trust in a strategic alliance and how blockchain-enabled interorganizational trust influences alliance performance.

Virtual environments and immersive games (such as, Second Life, Fortnite, Roblox and VRChat) have been described as antecedents of the metaverse and offer some insight to the potential socio-economic impact of a fully functional persistent cross platform metaverse. Separating the hype and “meta…” rebranding from current reality is difficult, as “big tech” paints a picture of the transformative nature of the metaverse and how it will positively impact people in their work, leisure, and social interaction. The potential impact on the way we conduct business, interact with brands and others, and develop shared experiences is likely to be transformational as the distinct lines between physical and digital are likely to be somewhat blurred from current perceptions. However, although the technology and infrastructure does not yet exist to allow the development of new immersive virtual worlds at scale - one that our avatars could transcend across platforms, researchers are increasingly examining the transformative impact of the metaverse. Impacted sectors include marketing, education, healthcare as well as societal effects relating to social interaction factors from widespread adoption, and issues relating to trust, privacy, bias, disinformation, application of law as well as psychological aspects linked to addiction and impact on vulnerable people. This study examines these topics in detail by combining the informed narrative and multi-perspective approach from experts with varied disciplinary backgrounds on many aspects of the metaverse and its transformational impact.

Many MGWs use an electronic network of practice (ENP) to facilitate information sharing about desirable and undesirable microtasks. This study uses social capital theory to theorize how social capital's dimensions – structural, cognitive, and relational – shape the development of uncertainty-reducing and individualized-skill benefits. Based on survey data from 436 Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers, the findings demonstrate that unique social capital dimensions affect specific ENP benefits. Understanding the communication style of an ENP (i.e., cognitive social capital) positively influences the uncertainty-reducing benefits of microtask information quality (MIQ) related to MTurk work. Combined with expectations of reciprocity and trust in ENP members (i.e., relational social capital), MIQ shapes microtask opportunity recognition (MOR), whereby individual MGWs identify opportunities to complete financially beneficial microtasks. The present study demonstrates that contextual factors, based on the coopetive nature of microtask ENPs, affect the interrelated structure of social capital theory and its underlying dimensions. Lastly, post hoc findings demonstrate the influence of MOR on MGWs’ financial performance, challenging previously held assumptions about the role of MIQ within the microtask literature. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Amazon Mechanical Turk; Crowdwork; Electronic network of practice; Gig economy; Microtask information quality; Microtask opportunity recognition; MTurk; Social capital theory"

Furthermore, the findings indicate that PEOU directly influences perceived usefulness, satisfaction, and attitude. Trust and enjoyment both have a positive impact on users’ satisfaction and IS continuance, wherein the effect of enjoyment was higher than trust. post-consumption satisfaction resulted in a favorable attitude toward technology, which further affected IS continuance. From a theoretical perspective, the current study acknowledges the shift in users’ attitude toward technology and emphasizes the hedonic value of IS usage as users report a higher degree of satisfaction toward responsive, easy to use, and enjoyable technologies.

We deploy an event study methodology to estimate the abnormal returns associated with drug trafficking activities in the cryptocurrency market. We find that the relationship between the two is quite strong in the case of some cryptocurrencies, albeit weaker in others. However, we show that drug bust news tends to create uncertainty, and accordingly impart risk into cryptocurrency markets. This study confirms the predictions of convenience theories of crime as to the relative attractiveness of cryptocurrencies to criminals, and the extent to which not only general, but also their own future interests, sacrificed readily on the altar of accessibility.

A qualitative study was first conducted to conceptualize the AIS characteristics associated with technostress appraisals. This study then builds a research model that posits perceived challenge and hindrance technostressors and coping responses as key mechanisms linking AIS characteristics and job burnout. The model was tested by collecting longitudinal data from 285 accountants. The results revealed that several AIS characteristics are associated with technostressor appraisals, and such appraisals lead to proactive and reactive coping responses, which further influence job burnout.

Universal factors for successful adoption are hard to establish, and the particularities of federalism, such as the separation of competencies, complicate technology selection. Nevertheless, blockchain technology seems to flourish in these environments. Through a single-case study on the blockchain project of Germany's Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, we unpack one essential factor for this success: the fit between (cross-)organizational task structure and technological properties. This fit earns the Federal Office's project considerable credit and traction with stakeholders and partner authorities – not least because it supports the argument that the digitalization of federal systems is possible without ‘digital centralization’ and redistribution of competencies. Our task-technology fit analysis contributes to a better understanding of the adoption of blockchain in the public sector.

The study finds that while telepresence of a 360-virtual store improves consumer attitudes toward virtual shopping, the need for hedonic sensory enjoyment – autotelic need for touch – significantly reduces this effect. Further, imagination can compensate for the need for touch; yet this finding holds only for the instrumental need for touch, not for the autotelic need for touch.

The objective of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework that explains the preference for inter-firm arrangements in OBCs and exhibits the capabilities of these technologies in mitigating contract inefficiencies. The proposed framework narrows the gap in the literature for a concurrent view of the latitudinal (ex-post, ex-ante) and longitudinal (reputation) dimensions of the contract. We represent the OBC as a concurrent stochastic game in a probabilistic model checker. Testing of our propositions revealed that these technology assets are complementary and joint ownership is desirable under reputation effects, reputation transfers take place between the contracting parties in the same direction, and continuous reallocation of ownership is required to maintain joint ownership. Rapid technological advancement and industry maturity can gravitate the transaction towards common ownership.

Thus, in this article, we develop a conceptual model of feedback mechanisms that includes a more explicit description of how affordances are perceived by users, whether actualized and adjusted. With the model, we introduce the central concept of a generative base, out of which affordance perceptions emerge and which can be updated through affordance actualizations. With this base, we integrate mental model (MM) theory to explain better the differing perceptions before and after actor–artifact interactions.

In this study, we conducted 40 interviews in two rounds with 20 teenage app users. Our results show that the users’ perceptions of mHealth affordances become adjusted and hence change over time due to experiencing the actualization process, which may lead to an update of the generative base, including the user's MM. © 2022","Actualization; Affordances; Feedback Mechanisms; Mental Models; Perception"

The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT's capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT's use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts. © 2023 The Authors","ChatGPT; Conversational agent; Generative AI; Generative artificial intelligence; Large language models"

Although past research shows how social media impacts on individuals’ cultural affiliations and identity construction processes, research neglects to understand the role and impact of the characteristics of social media and networking environments as individuals engage in these virtual spaces. This paper uses Instagram as a case study, to demonstrate the liminal nature of social media spaces and looks at how this virtual space and its characteristics evoke a sense of reflexivity with regards to identity construction amongst young British Sikhs in the U.K. We highlight how the empowering characteristics of this virtual space impact their identity and just how the communities that are formed by individuals through Instagram, act as a further acculturative agent, as they attempt to deal with the tensions that they experience as a result of being both British and Sikh. Findings implicate how brands can engage with and support the individuals going through this reflective identity re/construction process. © 2021","Acculturation; Identity construction; Instagram; Liminal spaces; Social media marketing, Imagined identities"

Instead of looking at a value, we investigate the usefulness of web-based open government portals and apps. Specifically, we investigated the relationship between digital transparency and usefulness. We analyzed perceived digital transparency and usefulness in a survey of 112 respondents using Partial Least Square (PLS) and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The results show that perceived functionality, transparency, and efficiency influence usefulness but that functionality of apps and efficiency are more important than transparency. Usefulness can be created without having high levels of transparency, as the public wants answers to their questions. Apps should be designed for efficient use, as users have limited time and resources. Apps having pre-defined functional views can be useful to provide quick insight but might limit transparency by not offering other views and insights. Opening raw data using portals can provide higher levels of transparency, although more time and effort are needed to analyze.

The dominant approach has been to predict use based on behavioral intention. Central to this approach is the assumption that use comes from conscious decision making, resulting from “thinking”, “reflecting”, and “cognition”. However, related work has shown that, over time and with increasing experience, use becomes habitual (routine, automatic) and when this happens, it is not subject to conscious decision making. This paper extends the technology adoption and use literature by testing the relative effects of intention and habit as determinants of use. We conducted a longitudinal field study over the period of one year, with 4 points of measurement in 7 organizations among 1235 users, to examine the effects of intention and habit from the formative stage of experience with a new technology through to an established, stable stage. The results provided strong support for habit as a predictor of use, especially over time, as use became well-rehearsed, and habit was a stronger determinant of use than intention was. In fact, habit dominates intention as a predictor of use, as experience increases. We discuss key implications for research and practice. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Automatic; Habit; Habitual use; Intention; Routine; Technology use"

Information technology can contribute to reducing such emissions by either virtualising or eliminating some human activities. However, without a proper understanding of humans’ value proposition and processes, such developments might not lead to behaviour that is more environmentally friendly. Thus, for digitalisation to reduce humans’ climate impact while maintaining or even improving the quality of human life, the value-adding aspect needs to be maintained. The core challenge lies in redesigning human processes, especially those related to work, so that environmentally harmful activities are eliminated while maintaining humans’ fundamental value proposition.

Referred to as IT consumerization, employees use their smartphones, notebooks and tablets in the workplace, accompanied by a growing toolbox of applications. Google Apps and Dropbox are just a few consumer tools that employees use to get their work done, and in doing so, often bypass the authority of the IT department and the organization. While some organizations discourage, or even prohibit, employees from using their personal IT, others embrace the phenomenon. Employees’ investment in consumer IT and its accompanying applications has been suggested as related to innovation and productivity gains, but there has been no empirical validation of such a beneficial relationship. With this paper we propose a theoretical root cause for the perceived positive outcomes of employees using their personal technologies in the workplace. Specifically, we explore the role of IT empowerment—a concept that captures the level of authority an employee assumes in utilizing IT in order to control or improve aspects of their job. Surveying 147 employees, we find support for increased levels of IT empowerment and higher levels of perceived performance among those that actively use consumer IT versus those that do not; we also find a close relationship between IT empowerment and perceived innovative work behaviors. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer IT; IT consumerization; IT empowerment; Perceived innovative work behaviors; Perceived productivity"

Although an essential capability, KI is also challenging to accomplish in practice due to relational obstacles. The relational obstacles arise because of knowledge boundaries: (a) syntactic boundary where the challenge is to transfer the knowledge; (b) semantic boundary where the challenge is to translate the knowledge; and (c) pragmatic boundary, where the challenge is to transform the knowledge to realize relational rents. In this paper, we propose that these relational obstacles could be resolved through a common lexicon, common meaning, and common interests, or common knowledge of knowledge actors that can serve as potential drivers to realizing relational rents. Analysis of data collected from 139 small firms indicates that common meaning and common interests positively influence KI. Further, KI positively influences organizational innovation. Moreover, the results demonstrate that novelty plays a crucial role in affecting the strength of relational resources’ relationships with KI capability. As novelty increases, the importance of common meaning and common interests on KI capability increases. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the role of relational obstacles and KI and empirically assess the efficacy of boundary-spanning objects in facilitating KI capability and innovation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Boundary spanning objects; Innovation; Knowledge boundary; Knowledge integration capability"

Due to the rapid algorithmification of platforms, it is timely to examine users’ awareness of algorithms on online platforms because these algorithms can shape everyday decisions and interactions through mediating, gatekeeping, and structuring user interactions. Focusing on the role of algorithm awareness (AA) in the privacy calculus process, we investigate users’ intention to disclose personal information when using a platform with personalized algorithms. By conceptualizing AA with a range of theoretical and behavioral variables, we examine how users’ self-efficacy affects their privacy concerns when they adopt, consume, and interact with such platforms. The findings show that AA leads users to envisage, understand, and interact with algorithms depending on their understanding of the control of the information flow embedded within them. The awareness that users have regarding algorithms influences the trust of algorithmic processes and the way users evaluate privacy concerns and self-disclosures. The cognitive user processes of AA provide conceptual frameworks for algorithm design and a practical guideline for the design of personalized algorithms. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Algorithm awareness; Personal privacy; Personalized algorithms; Privacy calculus; Self-disclosure; Self-efficacy"

Drawing on the “Affordances-Psychological Outcomes-Behavioural Outcomes” framework and related literature, this study examines the relationships among perceived gamification affordances, psychological ownership and consumer citizenship behaviour. Based on the survey of 387 gamified MiniApps consumers in the e-commerce platforms, structural equation modelling is used to examine the model, and the results support most hypotheses. The research extends our understanding of the direct and indirect effects of perceived gamification affordances on consumer citizenship behaviour, and the mediating role of psychological ownership. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer citizenship behaviour; E-commerce; Gamified information systems; Perceived gamification affordance; Psychological ownership"

Security breaches can involve the leak of sensitive data, and potentially lead to negative consumer reactions. It is, thus, timely and critical to theorize and empirically investigate the ways in which organization can respond effectively to security breaches and how consumers’ threat and coping appraisals vary according to the different response strategies. Our study addresses this lacuna by developing a conceptual model of i) security breach, ii) organization response strategies, and iii) consumer appraisal, grounded on the risk theory and protection motivation theory. We use the principal and agent perspectives to portray the breached organization as the agent providing the coping strategy, and consumers as the principal actors who evaluate the strategy. We incorporated a vignette-based survey to test the model with empirical data. We identify that the variations in the response strategy of organization after a security breach can lead to significantly different consumers’ reactions.

We integrated absorptive capacity and governance perspectives to theorize that an HDO's eHealth absorptive capacity is a dynamic IT capability to exploit eHealth innovations through the appropriate use of IT governance mechanisms. Drawing on absorptive capacity theory, we conceptualized an HDO's eHealth potential absorptive capacity as consisting of eHealth entrepreneurial alertness and assimilation. We draw on the theoretical perspectives of IT governance to identify two modes of eHealth governance—relational and contractual—and theorize how each of them affected the relationship between eHealth potential absorptive capacity and eHealth exploitation. Valid empirical data were gathered from 182 senior executive representatives in 111 HDOs; we discovered that (1) eHealth potential absorptive capacity can be formatively conceptualized as a second-order construct consisting of eHealth entrepreneurial alertness and eHealth assimilation, (2) eHealth potential absorptive capacity affects eHealth exploitation, and (3) relational governance significantly moderates the influence of eHealth potential absorptive capacity on eHealth exploitation. We discussed the implications of our work for how HDOs can govern eHealth initiatives to expand absorptive capacity for eHealth innovations and effectively exploit them. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Contractual governance; eHealth absorptive capacity; eHealth assimilation; eHealth entrepreneurial alertness; eHealth innovation; Relational governance"

With the explosion of information sources on the web and emergence of predictive analytics, many investors moved beyond traditional financial measures, as key predictors of firm performance, to textual content from analysts’ reports. Empirical research suggests that these information sources complement each other by providing a clear picture of firm performance, but remains silent on the role of additional textual content that continues to emerge and reach more potential investors on the web. We build on this line of research to examine the effect of textual content from business journals in conjunction with summary measures on cumulative abnormal returns. We use sentiment analysis with machine learning and econometrics methods to examine content extracted from textual articles about S&P 500 index companies that are published in the Wall Street Journal (years 2013–2016). Textual analysis of business journals in conjunction with quantitative measures revealed direct and interaction effects on abnormal returns over time. We also tested for robustness by replicating the analysis with different variable operationalization and observe consistent patterns. Relative to positive sentiments, negative sentiments have more profound effects on cumulative abnormal returns. The effect of positive sentiments becomes weaker when past quantitative measures are high. As information sources continue to emerge on the web, this work makes key contributions to the practice of sentiment analysis in financial markets. © 2022 The Authors","Abnormal returns; Econometrics; Machine learning; Sentiments"

The first one is theoretical and aims at defining a multi-dimensional social network based model of Yelp, three stereotypes of Yelp users, and a network based model to represent negative reviewers and their relationships. The second phase is experimental and consists in the definition of five hypotheses on negative reviews and reviewers in Yelp and their verification through an extensive data analysis campaign. This was performed on Yelp data represented by means of the models introduced during the first phase. Its most important result is the construction of the profile of negative influencers in Yelp.

Drawing on the compensation effect theory, this study investigates how verbal and nonverbal cues used by customer service agents during online service recovery processes affect customers’ perceptions of service chat agents’ warmth and competence and their willingness to cooperate with a service agent to complete the service recovery process. A 2 (message interactivity cues: high vs. low) × 2 (visual cues: high vs. low) between-subjects experimental design is utilized to identify the main and interaction effects of verbal and visual nonverbal cues used in online communications on customers attitudes and behaviors. Results show that use of verbal cues leads to higher perception of a chat agent's competence, but lower perception of a chat agent's warmth while use of visual nonverbal cues results in higher warmth perceptions but lower competence perceptions. The interaction effect of verbal and visual nonverbal cues indicates that visual nonverbal cues have a compensatory effect on message interactivity and vice versa, such that customer-perceived warmth and competence are prone to trade-offs between verbal cues and visual nonverbal cues. Furthermore, perceived warmth and competence mediate the indirect effects of verbal and nonverbal cues on customers’ cooperation intentions. Theoretical and practical implications of use of verbal and nonverbal cues during online communications in service recovery processes are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Compensation effects; Competence; Nonverbal cues; Service recovery cooperation intention; Verbal cues; Warmth"

Following a Design Science Research approach, this study aims to examine how gamification can help tailor OGD portals for lay citizens. As a pre-condition to this goal, we identify requirements toward OGD portals through twenty interviews with experts and lay citizens. Compared to expert users, lay citizens expect an OGD portal with a more playful interface, vulgarized content, customized visualizations, and transparency-related datasets in a human-readable format. Second, we develop our research artifact, the OGD portal prototype, implementing fifteen design propositions using gamification theory to address lay citizens’ requirements. Third, the evaluation with ten lay citizens reveals the perceived usefulness of the design propositions. Badges were evaluated as most useful to highlight portal relevance. This study contributes to OGD theory development by identifying lay citizens' requirements towards OGD use. Furthermore, this study is the first to reveal the usefulness of implementing notions from gamification theory into OGD portal design.

Most consumers use web stores for information and evaluation. This process influences their subsequent retailer selection and consumer satisfaction. In this study, the retailer brand, as the source of transaction information, is considered as a solution to the problem of transaction uncertainty. Brand attractiveness, the affective aspect of brand, is identified as an affective-based uncertainty mitigator and is considered together with brand credibility, the cognitive aspect of brand. Drawing on the source attractiveness/credibility model, retailer brand attractiveness and credibility are proposed and confirmed to reduce transaction uncertainty, in turn improving customer satisfaction. The moderating role of online–offline channel integration on the uncertainty reduction effect of retailer brand attractiveness and credibility is investigated. Online–offline channel integration has been found to be the essential condition for the uncertainty reduction effect of retailer brand attractiveness. Online–offline channel integration is also found to form a synergy with retailer brand credibility in reducing uncertainty.

Drawing on boundary management literature and information processing theory, we propose the concept of individual boundary spanning to capture employees’ information-obtaining behaviors via ESM and identify two mediating mechanisms—mindfulness and information overload—through which an individual's boundary spanning affects work performance. We also propose the concept of individual boundary buffering to capture protective actions by individuals that prevent them from becoming disturbed or overloaded with ESM requests. We further investigate the interaction effects of these two boundary activities in the ESM context. We conducted a survey and collected data from 202 ESM users from a research and development enterprise in China. The results suggest that individual boundary spanning triggers mindfulness in individuals that benefits their work performance but also increases information overload, harming work performance. Individual boundary buffering can enhance the positive relationship between individual boundary spanning and mindfulness, and mitigate the positive relationship between spanning activity and information overload. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Enterprise social media; Individual boundary buffering; Individual boundary spanning; Mindfulness"

Given the ever increasing growth and utilisation of information systems, it is more topical than ever to understand the role systems can play when it comes to sustainability. In this opinion paper, we identify and discuss four areas related to technology acceptance, one of the most popular information systems streams, that need to be considered when it comes to understanding the impact of information systems on the environment. These areas include the technology use predictors, the task-technology impact, implementation issues and the knowledge gap, and system lifetime and long-term implications.

We use protection motivation theory and regret theory, shedding light on how the individual's reflection of a future negative event, which they did nothing to prevent, would influence their current behavior. Fear appeal is experimentally manipulated to test different models of high and low threat. By comparing the impact of anticipated regret and fear on individuals’ protection motivation, we find that discrete emotions of fear and anticipated regret behave differently in increasing adaptive and reducing maladaptive responses to identity theft. Specifically, whereas fear is only effective when threat is high, anticipated regret is effective in both high and low threat conditions. Also, we find that anticipated regret has the most potent effect on increasing adaptive coping responses in a low threat model. This means that anticipated regret could be used in situations where the threat is low rather than fear. This research provides empirical evidence of conditions under which fear and regret motivate personal security protection measures, enabling practitioners to promote identity theft protection more efficiently. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anticipated Regret; Fear; Financial Loss; Identity Theft Protection; Maladaptive Responses; Protection Motivation"

To investigate when the effects of telework on job stress are beneficial versus dysfunctional, the study draws on telework research and cultural value theory and analyzes the moderating role of employee cultural background (i.e., individualism and power distance), the influence of which on the effects of telework is expected to be transmitted by an employee's beliefs about telework effectiveness and isolation. Although prior research analyzed the effects of telework in different occupations and industries, a very important matter has received very little attention – namely, the effects of telework on job stress across employees with different cultural backgrounds. To successfully implement telework arrangements, organizations must know whether employee cultural background influences the effectiveness of telework. The current COVID-19 pandemic and the related implementation of telework arrangements in many countries amplify the importance of understanding the influence of culture on the effects of telework on employee well-being. The hypotheses are tested through a three-wave survey study with 604 teleworkers from different countries. The results indicate that telework only reduces job stress when employees do not believe that telework will lead to social isolation. The study further expands telework research by showing that employees with high power distance scores have negative beliefs about telework, whereas employees with high individualism scores have positive beliefs about the effectiveness of telework. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cross-cultural management; Cultural values; Job stress; Social isolation; Telework; Working from home"

Our review of various literature hypothesizes that data-disclosing research gains more academic credit than non-data-disclosing research in the short term. However, this difference gradually disappears and reverses as the competition effect emerges. This pattern is expected to systematically differ depending on the academic reputation of the journals where the data-disclosing research is published.

The results show the following. First, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between supplier engagement and NPI performance. Second, SE positively impacts NPI performance, and knowledge sharing has an inverted U-shaped relationship with NPI performance. Further, when firms have a high-level rather than a low-level KOC, knowledge sharing has a significant mediating role.

Our results indicate that the consensus of appropriation (COA) and faithfulness of appropriation (FOA) are positively associated with IT-dependent organizational agility, and the relationships are partially mediated by IT alignment. When adoption of cloud computing is high, the positive relationship between IT alignment and IT-dependent organizational agility becomes stronger than when it is low. Interestingly, results also show that the moderating roles of the transfer of explicit knowledge and transfer of tacit knowledge in the relationship between outsourcing appropriation and IT-dependent organizational agility vary significantly. The transfer of explicit knowledge negatively moderates the relationship between COA and agility. The transfer of tacit knowledge positively moderates the relationship between FOA and agility.

First, extending the customer engagement literature, we develop the concept of GLP engagement (GLPE), defined as members’ GLP-related behavior, expressed through direct- (i.e., purchase) and/or indirect (e.g., GLP-related learning/advocating) contributions, which we argue are critical to GLP effectiveness. Extending prior research, we also classify members’ indirect GLP contributions as autonomous (vs. interdependent)-, selfless (vs. self-seeking)-, control (vs. laissez-faire)-based-, collaborative (vs. competitive)-, individual (vs. generic)-, and calculated (vs. non-calculated) contributions. Second, we develop a self-determination theory-informed framework that proposes members’ intrinsic/extrinsic motivation as major drivers of GLPE, which in turn impacts customer brand engagement value (CBEV). Third, formalizing the framework's associations, we develop a set of Propositions that serve as a springboard for further GLPE research.

In addition, it can also be detrimental to the existence of social media platforms. In this research, by synthesizing the prior literature on negativity bias in online settings, reasons for platform failure and the characteristics of social media platforms, we explain the mechanisms through which online fake news impacts the equity value of these platforms. We also develop and implement a two-stage Bayesian Vector Autoregression technique to test these mechanisms using a dataset from Twitter. Our results show that falsehood results in an equity value loss of approximately 2.11 Million USD over a ten-day period while a mere 67.17 Million falsehood tweets can interact with ambiguity to produce a loss of 10 Million USD. We also find that ambiguity helps mitigate the negative impact of fake news which we attribute to the fact that users converse and disambiguate news that arrives on social media platforms.

Although it is not as popular as before, from time to time we still find crowds of players gathered in some spots where Pokémon appear. Numerous reports have explored this Pokémon phenomenon; however, the exact reasons for its popularity remain unknown. The purpose of this study is to explore the post-adoption behavior of Pokémon Go players and its influential factors in the gaming and tourism industries. The theoretical model of stimulus-organism-response was drawn on to examine the impact of the environmental stimuli (social influence and media influence) on players’ internal organisms, which in turn affect their post-experience responses. Moreover, gender differences were also examined in the hypothetical relationships. A total of 342 valid questionnaires from actual gamers were collected in this study, and data analysis was performed using a structural equation model. The results show that stimulus effects, such as social stimuli (critical mass and social interaction) and media stimuli (content timeliness and media richness), have significant impacts on the players’ internal gamified experience (attachment and conformity), which in turn affect their visit intention to catch creatures at certain attractions and to continue playing Pokémon Go. Further, we have also found that players’ intention to visit Pokémon spots is significantly correlated with their intention to continue playing the game. Findings provide links between gamification and tourism literature. Further theoretical and managerial implications are provided. © 2021 The Author(s)","Attachment; Conformity; Continuance intention; Critical mass; Social interaction; Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) model; Tourism"

While basic game design includes challenges, players may feel that highly challenging in-game goals are distant and even unattainable, reducing their gameplay momentum. Thus, game developers face a dilemma between designing goals that seem unattainable or goals deemed too easy and thus not challenging enough, which our study addresses. To achieve this, we identified two new triggers derived from social cognitive theory (SCT) that could trigger the motivational process of goal gradient theory (GGT)—expectancy for character growth and gaming self-efficacy. Survey data from 1724 online game players were gathered and used to verify the model. Our study uniquely shows that expectancy for character growth can trigger motivation to attain gaming goals and that gaming self-efficacy can increase perceived gaming goal proximity and motivation to attain gaming goals and, thus, further sustain game usage. Collectively, this study helps resolve game developers’ aforementioned dilemma by recommending that they include challenging in-game goals and persuade players that they can achieve such goals immediately (i.e., gaming self-efficacy) or in the near future (i.e., expectancy for character growth), thus increasing perceived goal proximity or making goals seem closer. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Game usage; Goal gradient theory; Goal proximity; Online game; Structural equation modeling"

We ground our study in Moore's public value management to examine the relationship between AI use and value creation. We conceptually categorize public service value into public value and private value. We use procedural justice and trust in government as indicators of public value and, based on motivation theory, we use perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment as indicators of private value. A field survey of 492 AI voice robot users in China was conducted to test our model. The results indicated that the effective use of AI voice robots was significantly associated with private value and procedural justice. However, the relationship between the effective use of AI and trust in government was not found to be significant. Surprisingly, the respondents indicated that private value had a greater effect on overall value creation than public value. This contrasts with the common idea that value creation from the government perspective suggests that social objectives requiring public value are more important to citizens. The results also show that gender and citizens with different experiences show different AI usage behaviors. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Private value; Public value; Value creation; Voice robot"

Furthermore, it examines the impact of customers’ knowledge sharing attitude on the relationship between experiential value and customers’ information exchange behavior. Structural equation modeling was used to assess these dynamic relationships and provide a scalable measurement instrument that can be applied to gamified experiences ranging from simple customer-interface interactions, all the way up to multi-actor service ecosystems. Our findings support the notion that managers can use gamification to foster information exchange and thereby value co-creation between customers and employees directly, without necessarily having to change customers attitudes first. The findings also suggest that gamification can be applied successfully in cases of large groups of people with widely varying characteristics, backgrounds, and motivations. Additionally, our research indicates that experiential value is a suitable candidate for a consistent measurement instrument for gamification. This study is the first to apply a holistic experiential value approach to a gamified experience that simultaneously accounts for customers’ interactions with a multisensory physical environment, their personal interactions with employees, and their interactions with other customers. © 2021 The Authors","Experiential value; Gamification; Information exchange behavior; Knowledge sharing attitude; Multi-actor service ecosystem"

We surveyed 174 respondents occupying leadership positions from174 auto-components manufacturing firms in India to gather data. The findings suggest that normative and mimetic (but not coercive) factors significantly influence top leader's commitment to the BI initiatives. We found that the commitment of the top leaders influences the assimilation of BI via acceptance and routinization. Our study is an attempt to address the previous research calls related to BI assimilation.

While e-government has attained a level of sophistication in leading countries, there are countries for which going digital remains comparatively new on their national schedules. Their struggle and lag in reaching maturity in e-government can be attributed to corruption, which is an infamous issue prevalent across the globe and argued to impede technological innovation. Despite such a possibility, there is a paucity of research examining the “corruption–e-government” linkage. This study, hence, adopts the institutional perspective for conceptualizing corruption and seeks to understand the relationship of corruption in basic national institutions and national stakeholder service systems with e-government maturity. Specifically, by grounding the discussion on the agency theory, the rent-seeking theory, and the perspective of institutions as structures of cooperation and power, this study analyses the moderating influence of corruption in a national stakeholder service system (i.e., business systems) on the relationship of corruption in three basic national institutions (i.e., political, legal, and media) with e-government maturity in a country. The hypothesized relationships are empirically validated using a panel data of 94 countries, and the findings confirm that political corruption, legal corruption, and business-systems corruption in a country play vital roles in influencing its e-government maturity.

Using an exploratory case study approach, we examine ‘how’ rework information is currently being managed by an alliance that contributes significantly to delivering a multi-billion dollar mega-transport project. We reveal the challenges around location, format, structure, granularity and redundancy hindering the alliance's ability to classify and manage rework data.

Many perceived benefits surround AI, but a considerable amount of trepidation also exists because of the potential of AI to replace human employees and dehumanize work. Questions regarding the future of work in the age of AI are particularly salient in pre-adoption organizations, before employees have the opportunity to gain direct experience with AI. To cope with this potentially stressful situation, employees engage in cognitive appraisal processes based on their own knowledge and personal use of AI. These pre-adoptive appraisals of AI influence both affective and cognitive attitudes, which in turn trigger behavioral responses that influence an organization's ability to leverage AI successfully. Our survey of 363 Taiwanese employees shows that perceptions of AI's operational and cognitive capabilities are positively related to affective and cognitive attitudes toward AI, while concerns regarding AI have a negative relationship with affective attitude only. Interaction effects of employee knowledge and affective attitude are also observed. This work's main contribution lies in the development of an empirically-tested model of the potential impact of AI on organizations from an employee perspective in the pre-adoption phase.

The pandemic has imposed particular stressors on individuals, such as the threats of contracting the virus and of unemployment. Owing to the lockdowns and confinements implemented to limit the spread of the pandemic, SNS use has surged worldwide. Drawing on Lazarus and Folkman's theory of stress and coping, we consider COVID-19 obsession to be an adverse emotional response to the stressors brought about by the pandemic and emotional support seeking through SNS as a coping strategy. Furthermore, we identify SNS exhaustion as an adverse outcome of this form of coping. Finally, we analyze the intention to reduce SNS use as a corrective behavioral outcome to mitigate the negative effect of SNS-mediated coping. The findings indicate that: 1) the threat of the COVID-19 disease and the threat of unemployment drive COVID-19 obsession; 2) COVID-19 obsession contributes to emotional support seeking through SNS; 3) emotional support seeking through SNS exerts a positive effect on SNS exhaustion; 4) SNS exhaustion contributes to the intention to reduce SNS use. Our results advance Information Systems (IS) research by focusing on the use of Information Technology (IT) to cope with stressors that are essentially not IT-related; such research is largely absent from previous literature.

However, due to their rigidness, such linear frameworks are often ineffective. In this study, inspired by the Agile Manifesto, we propose the Agile IR Framework to refine, adjust, and improve the current linear IR process. We use the IR framework of UK's National Health Service (NHS) as an illustrative case, critically analysing the current linear IR framework and demonstrating how it can be transformed into a hybrid IR framework. Using an illustrative case study from the healthcare domain, this study contributes to the incident response literature by showcasing how the integration of Agile principles in archetypical linear IR processes can improve incident response. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agile methodologies; Healthcare; Incident Response; Information Security; Security Incident"

COVID-19 impacted social-distancing measures forced an abrupt switch to online learning in most universities, putting immense pressure on the students to creatively adapt to new ways of online learning. Despite the purported positives of online learning, in the COVID-19 scenario, students reported mixed outcomes. While some students could adapt to the ‘new normal’, others struggled to adjust to the transformed IT-enabled learning scenario. Grounding our work in IT mindfulness literature, we posit that an IT-enabled learning environment may have differential impact on students’ productivity- and creativity-in-learning, depending on the extent of their IT mindfulness. Besides leveraging the mindfulness-to-meaning theory, we hypothesize the mediating role of techno eustress in the relationship between student IT mindfulness and learning effectiveness. We test the theorized model through data collected via a two-wave survey in a university student population exclusively using IT-enabled learning environments during the pandemic lockdown period. Results indicate that IT mindfulness has significant positive relationships with both productivity- and creativity-in- learning. Moreover, these relationships are mediated by the students’ techno eustress perceptions. Theoretical and practical implications arising from our study are also discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Creativity; IT mindfulness; Productivity; Student learning; Techno eustress"

Despite substantial investment in research and development, the public's acceptance of DCT apps has been phenomenally low, signaling resistance among potential users. Little is known about why people would resist using the DCT app, a useful innovation that can potentially save millions of human lives. This study explores the determinants and consequences of citizens' resistance to use DCT apps using a sequential two-stage mixed-methods approach. The preliminary qualitative study analyzed interviews of 24 Indian smartphone users who chose not to use or discontinued the DCT app after an initial trial. In the quantitative stage, an integrated model based on innovation resistance theory and distrust theory was tested using the survey data collected from 194 non-adopters of the DCT app from India. The findings revealed that the factors, distrust, value barrier, information privacy concerns, and usage barrier predicted the resistance to the DCT app, and resistance, in turn, predicted intention to use. Additionally, distrust was found to be a key mediator between innovation barriers and resistance. The insights from this study could help the developers and policymakers formulate strategies for implementing DCT interventions during future disease outbreaks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Digital Contact-tracing app; Mixed-methods; Structural Equations Modeling; Thematic analysis"

With respect to the moderation effects, the results further show that time distance strengthens the effect of popularity on the social endorsement, but undermines the effect of source credibility; while crowdedness plays the role that strengthens the impact of popularity on the social endorsement, it has no significant moderating effect on the relationship between source credibility and social endorsement.

However, while there are technological challenges, there are equally just as important ethical challenges that these technologies also generate. Governments, funding agencies and non-governmental organisations increasingly recognise the importance of incorporating ethics into the development of emerging technologies (for example, within the EU draft legislation on AI). As the world faces the global challenge of climate change there are urgent efforts to develop strategies so that responses to the climate problems do not reproduce more of the same. Ethical values from the onset are fundamental to this process and need highlighting. Hence, this paper analyses a series of ethical codes, framework and guidelines of the new emerging technologies of climate engineering (CE) through a review of both published academic literature and grey literature from either industry, government, and non-governmental (NGO) organisations. This paper was developed as part of a collaboration with international partners from TechEthos (TechEthos receives funding from the EU H2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 101006249; Ethics of Emerging Technologies), an EU-funded project that deals with the ethics of the new and emerging technologies anticipated to have high socio-economic impact.

Especially in case of a limited alignment, the adoption and full use of the Enterprise System will require specific attention from implementers. By developing a theoretical explanation of how responses to Enterprise Systems are influenced by cultural values, we contribute to the development of a cultural alignment theory of Enterprise Systems. Drawing on Hofstede's cultural values framework, we analysed 85 published cases from firms operating in different cultural contexts, which resulted in the modelling of two contrasting archetypical cultural profiles: one that is more, and one that is less, receptive to the logics embedded in Enterprise Systems.

There is a shortage of empirical evidence on the impact of gamification on online consumer decisions. This study uses ‘psychological ownership theory’ and ‘schema theory’ to examine the effects of gameful experience (GFUL) on the attitudes of online gamers (N = 326). Data were analyzed using AMOS 25 and Process Macro for SPSS. The analytical results indicated that GFUL is mediated through both the intervening variables (perceived in-game advertisement effectiveness and psychological ownership), which positively influence gamers’ attitudes towards the game and in-game advertising.

In this study, the use of social media data, principally Twitter postings, is investigated to make approximate but rapid early assessments of damages following a disaster. The goal is to explore the potential utility of using social media data for rapid damage assessment after sudden-onset hazard events and to identify insights related to potential challenges. This study defines a text-based damage assessment scale for earthquake damages, and then develops a text classification model for rapid damage assessment.

For instance, tokenized securities are a new kind of blockchain-based asset enabling price stability, programmability, pseudonymity, and transaction efficiency, while also introducing new regulatory challenges and uncertainties. Conversely, index funds are an established investment device enabling broad diversification in a cost-effective, tax-efficient, and transparent way, while potentially also contributing to concentration of market power, intermediation cost, access barriers for underbanked or impoverished investors, increased market volatility, and human behavioral challenges.

Confronted with a big amount of data external and internal to their organization's managers strive for predictive data analysis that enables insight into the future, but even more for prescriptive ones that use algorithms to prepare recommendations for current and future actions. Most of the decision-making techniques use deterministic machine learning (ML) techniques but unfortunately, they do not take into account the variety and volatility of decision-making situations and do not allow for a more flexible approach, i.e., adjusted to changing environmental conditions or changing management priorities. A way to better adapt ML tools to the needs of decision-makers is to use swarm intelligence ML (SIML) methods that provide a set of alternative solutions that allow matching actions with the current decision-making situation. Thus, applying SIML methods in managerial decision-making is conceptualized as a company capability as it allows for systematic alignment of allocating resources decisions vis-à -vis changing decision-making conditions. The study focuses on the customer churn management as the area of applying SIML techniques to managerial decision-making. The objectives are twofold: to present the specific features and the role of SIML methods in customer churn management and to test if a modified SIML algorithm may increase the effectiveness of churn-related segmentation and improve decision-making process. The empirical study uses publicly available customer data related to digital markets to test if and how SIML methods facilitate managerial decision-making with regard to customers potentially leaving the company in the context of changing conditions. The research results are discussed with regard to prior studies on applying ML techniques to decision-making and customer churn management studies.

This study proposes a UTAUT-based integrated model from the perspective of information system (IS) engineers, and explores the determinants of PbD implementation. The implementation of PbD and privacy protection measures relay heavily on IS engineers. However, there is a paucity of research exploring IS engineers’ acceptance of PbD, particularly research that considers engineers’ individualized factors and personal attitudes. Empirical data collected from 261 IS engineers in China demonstrate the rationality of proposed model and the importance of integrating conceptual constructs. The findings suggest that IS engineers’ attitude towards PbD implementation significantly impacts both their behavioral intention and their implementing behavior. IS engineers’ awareness of PbD is a predictor of their effort and performance expectancies, and intention to implement; IS engineers’ effort and performance expectancies concerning PbD usage have significantly impact on their attitude towards PbD. This study reveals the factors that motivate IS engineers to implement PbD into their workflow and proposes for the first time that IS engineers’ attitude towards PbD usage is the key factor for PbD implementation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Information system security; Privacy by Design; Privacy information protection; Technology acceptance; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model"

Prior research models have examined direct effects on SU, indirect effects on SU through BI, the moderator effects on BI→SU, and the mediating role of BI in BI→SU. Studies have employed different types of respondents, information technologies, geographic regions, voluntariness, and measurement designs.

However, most datasets collected to solve complex and ill-structured problems do not have labels. Additionally, most AI algorithms are opaque and not easily interpretable, making it hard for decision-makers to obtain model insights for developing effective solution strategies.

Using survey data from gamified ERP training of 248 professionals from three different organizations, results support the proposed model, suggesting that ERP knowledge is an important antecedent of ERP self-efficacy, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and attitude. We find that ERP knowledge exhibits both direct and indirect effects on attitude. Moreover, we find that gamified training is an effective means of improving ERP knowledge. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Attitude; Enterprise resource planning; Gamification; Knowledge; Serious games; Technology acceptance"

Consequently, corporations adopt Enterprise Mobile Systems (EMS) to facilitate employees working from home, ensuring security and privacy. Notwithstanding the business benefits of EMS, the adoption rate of these solutions by employees is significantly low. Traditional theories on technology adoption do not explain why some employees choose to use EMS through their mobile devices to access official applications, while others refrain. This study uses construal level theory and rational choice theory to examine the role of use contexts and intention to comply with EMS policy on employees' decision to adopt EMS. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods was applied. A mixed approach was followed for this study and analysis was done based on country-wide cross-sectional survey of 330 professionals engaged with reputed information technology companies. The results highlight that employees’ use contexts and intentions to comply with the EMS policy are strong antecedents of adapting to new systems. The results also reinforce that policy awareness positively affects the intention to comply with EMS policies, impacting employee engagement and task performance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Construal Level Theory; Enterprise Mobile System; Rational Choice Theory"

Literature shows that these technologies hold great potential for enterprises as they can increase productivity and are cost-efficient by automating processes. Still, to not alienate employees when introducing these systems called Enterprise Bots in this paper, it is crucial to understand how employees accept and adopt these new systems. This paper derives a research model based on the decomposed Theory of Planned Behaviour, which is tested in a survey with 198 participants. Results from a structural equation model show that intrinsic motivation of the employees has a strong positive influence on the intention to use Enterprise Bots whereas external influences showed smaller effects. The results indicate that it is important that employees are convinced of the usefulness of a tool for themselves. The paper provides theoretical insights and helps decision makers to introduce such systems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Chatbots; Digital workplace; Digitalization; Enterprise bots; Technology acceptance; Theory of planned behavior; Virtual agents; Virtual assistants"

Social media has been implicated in fueling this polarization. In this paper, we uncover the network of COVID-19 related news sources shared to 30 politically biased and 2 neutral subcommunities on Reddit. We find, using exponential random graph modeling, that news sources associated with highly toxic – “rude, disrespectful” – content are more likely to be shared across political subreddits. We also find homophily according to toxicity levels in the network of online news sources. Our findings suggest that news sources associated with high toxicity are rewarded with prominent positions in the resultant network. The toxicity in COVID-19 discussions may fuel political polarization by denigrating ideological opponents and politicizing responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, all to the detriment of mitigation measures. Public health practitioners should monitor toxicity in public online discussions to familiarize themselves with emerging political arguments that threaten adherence to public health crises management. We also recommend, based on our findings, that social media platforms algorithmically promote neutral and scientific news sources to reduce toxic discussion in subcommunities and encourage compliance with public health recommendations in the fight against COVID-19. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Affiliation networks; Exponential random graph modeling; News sharing; Political polarization; Social media; Toxicity"

By looking at machine learning tools as part of a sociotechnical system, we explore how machine learning tools enforce oppression of workers. We theorize, normatively, that with reorganizing processes in place, oppressive characteristics could be converted to emancipatory characteristics. Drawing on Paulo Freire's critical theory of emancipatory pedagogy, we outline similarities between the characteristics Freire saw in oppressive societies and the characteristics of currently designed partnerships between humans and machine learning tools. Freire's theory offers a way forward in reorganizing humans and machine learning tools in the workplace. Rather than advocating human control or the decoupling of workers and machines, we follow Freire's theory in proposing four processes for emancipatory organizing of human and machine learning partnership: 1) awakening of a critical consciousness, 2) enabling role freedom, 3) instituting incentives and sanctions for accountability, and 4) identifying alternative emancipatory futures. Theoretical and practical implications of this emancipatory organizing theory are drawn. © 2021","Artificial intelligence; Emancipatory organizing theory; Machine learning; Normative theory; Oppression; Organizing for the future of work"

Information facets, such as equivocality and veracity, can dominate and significantly influence human perceptions of information and consequently affect human performance. Extant research in cognitive fit, which preceded the big data and AI era, focused on the effects of aligning information representation and task on performance, without sufficient consideration to information facets and attendant cognitive challenges. Therefore, there is a compelling need to understand the interplay of these dominant information facets with information representations and tasks, and their influence on human performance. We suggest that artificially intelligent technologies that can adapt information representations to overcome cognitive limitations are necessary for these complex information environments. To this end, we propose and test a novel “Adaptive Cognitive Fit” (ACF) framework that explains the influence of information facets and AI-augmented information representations on human performance. We draw on information processing theory and cognitive dissonance theory to advance the ACF framework and a set of propositions. We empirically validate the ACF propositions with an economic experiment that demonstrates the influence of information facets, and a machine learning simulation that establishes the viability of using AI to improve human performance. © 2022 The Authors","Adaptive; Artificial intelligence; Augmentation; Cognitive fit; Equivocality; Information; Information facet; Information processing; Machine learning; Optimal performance"

GS countries are trying to leverage their growing demand for innovative products and services to negotiate the uptake of novel technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI). The latter can help such countries further stimulate their economic growth and become influential in dictating policies that could advance global development. However, a misaligned AI-adoption strategy entails the risk of alienating the social, economic, and even cultural requirements of such countries, ultimately leading to the incorporation of technologies not serving the needs of their users. Subsequently, we conduct a study whose goal is to provide guidelines on how to perform a comprehensive analysis of the AI ecosystems in GS countries, to determine their readiness to adopt and utilize beneficially these technologies. For this, we performed a qualitative case study of two GS countries, namely Senegal and Cambodia. The depiction of their AI ecosystems unveiled the need to stimulate their societies (i.e., by media exposure, education, etc.) in discerning the practical effects of AI. However, an impactful AI implementation requires a reciprocated satisfaction of the needs of multiple contributing actors. Finally, particular recommendations are offered at the level of these countries’ academic, industrial, and governmental constitutions, suggesting to focalize their resources in order to better energize (and optimally disperse) their research and entrepreneurial capabilities that could help identify the ways in which AI solutions can be of added-value within the premises of these two countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","AI ecosystems; AI readiness; Digital transformation; Global South"

The aim of this descriptive review was to systematically investigate peer-reviewed publications focused on SC research in SEE in order to present the findings and the state-of-art in this research domain. Seventy-four papers were thoroughly studied, analysed and classified based on their focus on SC themes and common sub-themes. While smart governance had been studied extensively in the SEE region, topics related to the smart economy and smart people received low attention from researchers. Mapping the selected papers to the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle showed that SC research in SEE is still in the conceptualising and planning stages, with very little evidence from the real implementation and follow-up activities. From the stakeholders’ perspective, the focus is on the institutional point of view as most of the papers present their findings in relation to (national or local) government bodies or policies, without balancing with corresponding businesses’ or individuals’ (users’) point of view.

Our data analysis applied a grounded approach which was then refined using an emotion theoretic lens with the application of Technology Threat Avoidance Theory (TTAT). Drawing on structural appraisal theory, our findings indicate the IT security team in the case study oscillated between positive problem-focused coping and negative emotion-focused coping. A key explanatory feature or turnaround mechanism that mediated this oscillation was senior management empathy and resource mobilization. Building on the analyses, a conceptual model is developed called the Transformation of Coping through Empathic Leadership (T-CEL).

In this research, we investigate a two-stage optimization of intermodal terminals main parameters via using AnyLogic simulation platform. We have developed a set of hybrid simulation models to optimize the main parameters of intermodal terminals which are also called dry ports. To make an express evaluation of the preliminary implementation of dry ports, we have developed an agent-based system dynamics simulation model to achieve the stable state of the main parameters of intermodal terminals. To clarify the obtained averaged benefits of the main dry ports parameters while the port managers make key decisions on the investments into implementation of intermodal terminals, we have developed an agent-based discrete-event simulation model of a seaport – a dry port system. We show that the combination of the agent-based modeling with other simulation approaches simplifies the process of designing simulation models and increases their visibility.

While prior research has mainly focused on intention or adoption phase, little work has empirically examined the post-adoption effects of MHA with scarce attention given to the well-being outcome. Actual users are likely to conceive the values of MHA based mainly on their direct experience with it. In this paper, the dimensions of users’ technology readiness are regarded as major impetuses for perceived utilitarian and hedonic values, which in turn influence subjective well-being among MHA users. The proposed readiness-value model is analyzed using survey data collected from 731 users of MHA. The findings show that the model significantly predicts users’ subjective well-being considering that utilitarian value is more important for male users, whereas hedonic value has a more salient effect for female users. It also reveals that enablers of technology readiness (i.e., innovativeness and optimism) exert a stronger influence than that of inhibitors (i.e., discomfort and insecurity) on the perceived values of MHA.

This requires the exploration of business data through data-driven approaches, while modelling business strategies together with domain experts in order to represent domain knowledge. In particular, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) allow human experts to properly model ambiguous enterprise goals by means of quantitative variables with numeric ranges and clear thresholds. Besides business-related domains, the usefulness of KPIs has been shown in multiple domains, such as: Education, Healthcare and Agriculture. However, finding accurate KPIs for a given strategic goal still remains a complex task, specially due to the discrepancy between domain assumptions and data facts. In this regard, the semantic web emerges as a powerful technology for knowledge representation and data modeling through explicit representation formats and standards such as RDF(S) and OWL. By using this technology, the semantic annotation of indicators of business objectives would enrich the strategic model obtained. With this motivation, an ontology-driven approach is proposed to formally conceptualize essential elements of indicators, covering: performance, results, measures, goals and relationships of a given business strategy. In this way, all the data involved in the selection and analysis of KPIs are then integrated and stored in common repositories, hence enabling sophisticated querying and reasoning for semantic validation. The proposed semantic model is evaluated on a real-world case study on water management. A series of data analysis and reasoning tasks are conducted to show how the ontological model is able to detect semantic conflicts in actual correlations of selected indicators. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Knowledge extraction; KPI Modelling; Ontology; Reasoning; Semantics; Water management"

In this study, we draw on interpretive case study methodology and technology affordances and constraints theory to investigate a smart service system use for seaport security in Ghana. With insights from the case of Ghana, we introduce an affordance constraints process as a framework to complement the existing affordance actualisation process framework in information systems. Thus, this study contributes to affordance theory with a new constraints process. The study's findings show that smart service systems for seaport security afford autonomous access control, real-time security monitoring, and autonomous data capturing for analytics and reporting. However, such affordances can be constrained by power and internet outages, limited storage capacity, and device breakdowns. From these findings, we discuss implications for theory, research, and practice as well as limitations and directions for future research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Affordances; Ghana; Interpretive case study; Seaport security; Smart service systems; Smart technology"

The three benefits might affect information disclosure intention differently. As an extension, individual factors, such as gender, may affect the relationship. However, according to literature, little research has investigated on the combined influence of the three benefits on the information disclosure intention in LBS with the gender as a moderator. Based upon the self-determination and social role theories, this study intends to bridge the gap empirically. The hypotheses are largely supported by 215 respondents. Unexpectedly, the research findings show that for females, locatability and personalization are more important in predicting their information disclosure intention, whereas for males, the social benefit has more of an impact on information disclosure intention, which is opposite to the hypotheses and convention. Furthermore, the research findings indicate that the behaviors of males and females may conform to the roles distributed within a society of this information age rather than to the personalities of the individuals.

Humans inherently, subconsciously use facial cues as important shortcuts in making assessments about other persons. On property sharing platforms, such as Airbnb, facial cues can be used in a similar fashion alongside reputational information. According to Dangerous Decisions Theory (DDT), intuitive evaluations of trustworthiness based on faces can bias subsequent assessment of an individual, requiring further information sources to make a more balanced assessment. In this study we apply DDT to demonstrate that evaluations based on perceived facial trustworthiness are overvalued; when combined with reputational measures, such as ‘super host’ status, such assessments are diminished. The study is based on deep learning to classify host faces for a large data set of online accommodation (n = 78,386). The research demonstrates that facial trust cues in online platforms should be treated with caution and must be combined with more objective measures of reputation in order to reduce the effects of overvaluation.

Investigation focused primarily on the entrepreneurial capability (ENCAP) of such firms and industrial competition (INDCOM) as predictors of the IBCO of a business. Analysis was conducted as to whether IBCO contributed to heightened market sensing capability (MKTSENSE) and indirectly reinforced competitiveness. To this end, data was sourced from 198 firms based in Nigeria, typically micro-, small- and medium-sized businesses. Statistical analysis indicated that IBCO had a stronger and direct effect on encouraging the fluency of operations at small- and medium-sized enterprises. However, IBCO in combination with a competitive advantage was insufficient to attain competitiveness, the magnitude of such an effect being indirectly anchored to the MKTSENSE of the firm.

One of the significant areas of opportunity in digital marketing is influencer marketing, but identifying these influencers from big data sets is a continual challenge. This research illustrates how one type of influencer, the market maven, can be identified using big data. Using a mixed-method combination of both self-report survey data and publicly accessible big data, we gathered 556,150 tweets from 370 active Twitter users. We then proposed and tested a range of social-media-based metrics to identify market mavens. Findings show that market mavens (when compared to non-mavens) have more followers, post more often, have less readable posts, use more uppercase letters, use less distinct words, and use hashtags more often. These metrics are openly available from public Twitter accounts and could integrate into a broad-scale decision support system for marketing and information systems managers. These findings have the potential to improve influencer identification effectiveness and efficiency, and thus improve influencer marketing. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; Influencers; Market mavens; Social media; Twitter"

The emerging literature on the role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the poverty alleviation of BoP producers focuses on ICT-enabled solutions to value capture. However, ICT-enabled solutions to create value at the BoP have received less attention. In this paper, we study the issues surrounding value creation for non-commodity BoP producers by employing a case study of four organisations in rural India. Our findings reveal two critical mechanisms for ICT-enabled value creation in a resource-constrained environment: awareness creation and repeated engagement. We find that ICT-enabled awareness creation has a positive impact on value-added, but this effect decreases as product complexity increases. We also find that ICT-mediated repeated engagement and value-added have an inverted U-shape relationship, with value-added increasing with complexity, but after a threshold, value-added declines with increase in complexity. Building on these findings, we use the lens of value co-creation and media richness perspective to contribute to theory, practice and policy by underscoring how awareness creation and repeated engagement act as key dimensions for value creation. We delineate how limitations in ICT infrastructure can be overcome in resource-constrained environments and explicate a conceptualisation of ICT-mediated joint value creation in general for spatially separated actors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Awareness; Inequality; Poverty; Repeated engagement; Resource-constrained environment; Rural development; Value capture; Value co-creation; Value creation"

In this paper, we propose two data-driven approaches that allow making better decisions in supply chain management.

Unlike other approaches, we recommend combining external and internal company data sources for the purpose of enhancing the performance of forecasting algorithms using multivariate LSTM with the optimal hyperparameters. In addition, we also propose a method to optimize hyperparameters for hybrid algorithms for detecting anomalies in time series data. The proposed approaches will be applied to both benchmarking datasets and real data in fashion retail. The obtained results show that the LSTM Autoencoder based method leads to better performance for anomaly detection compared to the LSTM based method suggested in a previous study.

This research aims to investigate the adaptation strategies embraced by managers to cope with the BYOD phenomenon. To this end, we operationalized the coping model of user adaptation (CMUA) in the organizational decision-making context to conduct a survey addressing 337 top managers.

The study also investigates five antecedents (playfulness, escapism, anthropomorphism, visual appeal, and social presence) to both attitudes. Through an online survey of 360 respondents, the study suggests that playfulness and escapism positively influence hedonic attitude. On the other hand, anthropomorphism, visual appeal, and social presence determine utilitarian attitude. Further, utilitarian attitude has a stronger impact (vs. hedonic attitude) on SVA usage and WOM recommendations. The findings reveal that individuals who perceive SVA as a symbol of high prestige (vs. low prestige) are less likely to relate playfulness to hedonic gratifications. In contrast, people attributing prestige to SVA are more likely to use it as an escape route from everyday life. These findings contribute to the growing literature on SVA adoption and offer insightful recommendations to various stakeholders to increase the likelihood of SVA adoption and generating favorable WOM recommendations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropomorphism; Artificial intelligence; Hedonic attitude; Smart voice assistants; Technology adoption; Utilitarian attitude"

The number of factors that influence the identification easily runs into a few hundreds (including floor space area, crime in the locality and so on). Existing literature predominantly focuses on the analysis of price trends in a given location. This paper aims to develop a set of tools to compute an optimal location for investment, a problem which has received little attention in the literature (analysis of house price trends has received more attention). In previous work the authors proposed a machine learning approach for computing optimal locations. There are two main issues with the previous work. All real estate factors were assumed to be independent and identically distributed random variables. To address this, in the current paper we propose a network structure to derive the relational inferences between the factors. However, solving the location identification problem using only a network incurs computational burden. Hence, the machine learning layers from the previous work is combined with a network layer for computing an optimal location with proven lower computational cost. A second issue is that the computations are performed on an online database which has inherent privacy risks. The online data, user information and the algorithms can be tampered through privacy breaches. We present a privacy preservation technique to protect the algorithms, and use blockchains to secure the identity of the user.

While research in information security has adopted primarily a quantitative method to determine how and how much to invest in security, most decision makers rely on non-quantitative methods for this purpose, thereby introducing a considerable amount of as yet unexplained subjective judgment to the problem. We use a behavioral decision making approach to investigate factors causing possible inefficiencies of security spending decisions. Decision makers in our experiment performed a series of economic games featuring the key characteristics of a typical security problem. We found several biases in investment decisions. For budgeting their investment between major classes of security measures, decision makers demonstrated a strong bias toward investing in preventive measures rather than in detection and response measures, even though the task was designed to yield the same return on investment for both classes of measures. We term this phenomenon the “Prevention Bias.” Decision makers also reacted to security threats when the risk was so small that no investment was economically justified. For higher levels of risk that warranted some security investment, decision makers showed a strong tendency to overinvest.

With a growing amount of big data available, fashion retailers need to innovate and develop more sophisticated analytics for new consumer behaviours such as m-commerce. This research has considered how Google Analytics data can be applied to develop customer journey maps to understand digital consumer behaviour. A multi-method research design was used, incorporating an innovative mobile eye tracking technology and mobile fashion consumer data from Google Analytics. Digital customers’ shopping journeys on the fashion retailer's website were mapped using data sourced from eye tracking and Google Analytics, gathered in parallel. The comparison of these shopping journeys allowed a critical evaluation of the precision and usefulness of the Google Analytics database. Google Analytics tracked only half of the digital users’ activities, whereas eye tracking data documented digital consumers’ interaction with all elements of the fashion retailer's website. The conclusion reached is that eye tracking can be used to audit the Google Analytics database for potential gaps in data and also to inform and improve marketing decision-making. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer shopping journey; Digital consumer; Eye tracking; Fashion m-retail; Fashion retail; Google analytics; Marketing analytics"

However, limited academic research has been done to validate empirically artificial autonomy and its downstream consequences on human behavior. This study investigates the role of artificial autonomy by dividing it into three types of autonomy in terms of task primitives, namely, sensing, thought, and action autonomy. Drawing on mind perception theory, the authors hypothesize that the two fundamental dimensions of humanlike perceptions—competence and warmth—of non-human entities could explain the mechanism between artificial autonomy and IPA usage. Our results reveal that the comparative effects of competence and warmth perception exist when artificial autonomy contributes to users' continuance usage intention. Theoretically, this study increases our understanding of AI-enabled artificial autonomy in information systems research.

Classic urban form visualizations – from Giambattista Nolli's ichnographic maps of Rome to Allan Jacobs's figure-ground diagrams of city streets – have compressed physical urban complexity into easily comprehensible information artifacts. Today we can enhance these traditional workflows through the Smart Cities paradigm of understanding cities via user-generated content and harvested data in an information management context. New spatial technology platforms and big data offer new lenses to understand, evaluate, monitor, and manage urban form and evolution. This paper builds on the theoretical framework of visual cultures in urban planning and morphology to introduce and situate computational data science processes for exploring urban fabric patterns and spatial order. It demonstrates these workflows with OSMnx and data from OpenStreetMap, a collaborative spatial information system and mapping platform, to examine street network patterns, orientations, and configurations in different study sites around the world, considering what these reveal about the urban fabric.

Forwarding and commenting on posts contribute to the huge networks of topic and sentiment communication. This study constructs the topic and sentiment propagation maps of microblogging in the context of public events to visually explore the patterns of topic and sentiment propagation among stakeholders across different phases. To quantify the influence of topic and sentiment propagation, four indicators of “topic out-degree,” “topic variation degree,” “sentiment out-degree,” and “sentiment deviation degree” are proposed. We chose the child abuse case in the Beijing Red-Yellow-Blue (RYB) Kindergarten for our study. The positions of various stakeholders in the propagation paths and the relationship among stakeholders were revealed. Results indicate that the government and mainstream media have the greatest influence in terms of topic and sentiment propagation. Moreover, topic propagation was the most influential in the recession phase and the same can be said with sentiment propagation in the spreading phase. The findings can help the emergency management departments gain a better understanding of the propagation patterns of topics and emotions and the role of stakeholders in such phenomena to improve their emergency response ability. © 2021","Microblogging; Public event; Sentiment contagion; Stakeholder; Topical influence"

This study explores how personality, trust, privacy concerns, and prior experiences affect customer experience performance perceptions and the combinations of these factors that lead to high customer experience performance. Goldberg's Big Five Factors of personality, a contextualized theory of reasoned action (TRA-privacy), and recent literature on customer experience are used to develop and propose a conceptual research model. The model was tested using survey data from 224 US-based voice shoppers. The data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). PLS-SEM revealed that trust and privacy concerns mediate the relationship between personality (agreeableness, emotional instability, and conscientiousness) and voice shoppers’ perceptions of customer experience performance. FsQCA reveals the combinations of these factors that lead to high perceptions of customer experience performance.

We focus on the social influence perspective and use IT outsourcing decisions as exemplars of strategic IT decisions. Using a data sample of 77 outsourcing contracts from the automotive industry from 1995 to 2010, we find that even after controlling for financial factors, industry average levels of outsourcing can be used to distinguish strategic outsourcing behaviors of firms for IT enabled services. Firms with above-average levels of IT outsourcing tended to further increase outsourcing, a behavior consistent with perceived Red Queen competitive pressures. Firms with below-average levels of IT outsourcing showed no measurable trends of either increasing or decreasing outsourcing levels. This suggests that firm-specific factors influence IT outsourcing decisions and deviations from non-financial industry norms can indicate how firms make strategic IT decisions. © 2020","Information systems outsourcing; information technology enabled services; IT capability; outsourcing contracts; Red Queen effect"

By conducting a netnographic study to observe fashion bloggers’ messages concerning Western luxury brands on Chinese social media, this research identified six distinct narrative strategies that are different in linking the purpose of eWOM, assigning brands with roles in eWOM, representing the meanings associated with brands, and using modes of persuasion to convince consumers to accept these meanings. This research also proposes a model to illustrate the structure of SMIs’ narrative strategies.

However, the study on the training path data, which specifies the desired output of a neural network and in turn influences the behavior of the neural network, has been neglected in the literature. Motivated by this fact, in this paper, we first generate different training path data sets applying two different offline path planning algorithms and evaluate the performance of a neural network as an online path planner depending on the training data under a simulation environment.

Our analysis of all the mid-size automobile recall events in the U.S. from 2010 to 2015, the corresponding social media discussions of the recall and the competitive actions taken by the recalling firms and their competitors revealed that after recalls: (1) fewer competitive actions by the recalling firm are more effective in influencing car sales; (2) although social media discussions can increase awareness and sales, the change in perceptions of the brand on social media can negatively affect sales; and (3) the positive effect of social media on offline car sales is amplified when the recalling firm conducts fewer competitive actions, regardless of strategic or tactical actions, but is attenuated when competitors conduct more competitive actions. The current study adds to the competitive actions literature by considering the boundary conditions under which recalling firms can construct their competitive actions more effectively and extends the social media literature by incorporating both the focal and non-focal firms’ perspectives when examining the role of social media.

However, recent developments of machine learning within Big Data environment have not been exploited enough in this domain. This paper aims to answer the question of how to incorporate Big Data platform and machine learning into an intelligent system for managing energy efficiency of public sector as a substantial part of the smart city concept. Deep neural networks, Rpart regression tree and Random forest with variable reduction procedures were used to create prediction models of specific energy consumption of Croatian public sector buildings. The most accurate model was produced by Random forest method, and a comparison of important predictors extracted by all three methods has been conducted. The models could be implemented in the suggested intelligent system named MERIDA which integrates Big Data collection and predictive models of energy consumption for each energy source in public buildings, and enables their synergy into a managing platform for improving energy efficiency of the public sector within Big Data environment. The paper also discusses technological requirements for developing such a platform that could be used by public administration to plan reconstruction measures of public buildings, to reduce energy consumption and cost, as well as to connect such smart public buildings as part of smart cities. Such digital transformation of energy management can increase energy efficiency of public administration, its higher quality of service and healthier environment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy efficiency; Machine learning; Planning models; Public sector; Smart cities"

Yet, there are challenges in gaining viewership of this new format, with a lack of understanding and research on what drives such viewing behavior. To fill this gap, this study draws on the theory of consumption values to develop a model explaining the decision factors that can predict online TV clip viewing behavior. We tested the model through a quantitative analysis of survey and archival (viewing logs) data from 398 viewers from a major provider of TV clips. The results indicate that, in addition to convenience and enjoyment, fandom and social viewing are unique factors predicting watching frequency and mediated by the continuance intention to watch online TV clips. Our study contributes to our understanding of the use of this new digital content format by integrating and extending concepts from the theory of consumption values.

This phenomenon has called attention to the issue of continued WFT use, with emphasis on how the value of the WFT can be sustained. Using the concept of value co-creation, this research aims to understand the effects of actor-to-actor interactions on continued use of a WFT, with a specific focus on the interactions generated through two WFT services: choice and involvement of dietitians. Considering a WFT's service system as part of the greater healthcare ecosystem, this paper also considers the moderating role of self-efficacy in health management as an internal factor and healthcare system satisfaction as an external factor. A randomized experimentation using a scenario-based survey was conducted, and the data generated by 423 participants were analyzed. The results emphasize the significant positive effect of dietitian involvement on users’ intentions to continue using their WFT. Dietitian involvement not only improves continued use intention, but also realizes the effect of choice. The positive effect of dietitian involvement is robust, regardless of user satisfaction with the healthcare service system. Self-efficacy in health management also plays a key role in positively moderating the effect of choice on continued use intention. This study expands information system literature by providing theoretical insights into continued use from the perspective of value-co-creation. Our findings also have implications for the development of service systems for fitness wearables. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Actor-to-actor interaction; Choice; Continued use; Human agency; Service system; Value co-creation; Wearable fitness tracker"

The current view of IQ in a healthcare context is static. It assumes that once the EHR system generates the information product, individual users may act on the information based on their subjective perception of its quality. However, this view ignores the complexities of secondary use of EHR data, in which users are actively involved in (re)generating and communicating the information product. Thus, IQ does not remain static but keeps on transforming through active engagement and interpersonal communication. To contribute to this debate, we conducted a qualitative case study in a Norwegian healthcare context by employing an IQ life cycle model. In conclusion, we enhanced the existing IQ model by (1) adding interpersonal communication, (2) showing the interrelations of the IQ dimensions, and (3) integrating the mechanisms of the transformation process for IQ in secondary use of EHR data. In doing so, we unfold the dynamics of IQ in the secondary use of EHR data. © 2020 The Author(s)","Communication quality; EHR; Information quality (IQ); Life cycle; Mechanisms; Secondary use"

Egyptian protesters were supported not only in the Arabic-speaking world, but also throughout the English speaking world. The Twittersphere1 became a valuable arena for individuals to communicate amongst each other regarding important social movement issues. This paper is a study of the communication on Twitterverse consisting of both English and Arabic tweets and the sentiments expressed therein during the Egyptian protest movement. We focus on the research questions: what sentiments of Tweeters relate to signals of protest communication?, and how do protest related tweets in two languages in the Twitter sphere, that are a proxy of two different and important cultural groups, compare with each other? In order to understand the protest communications in Twittersphere, we examine a dual pathways model that relates to emotional and goal related sentiments. We apply this model to examine the online protest in Egypt. Our findings reveal the emotions and goal related sentiments that are fundamental for intention to protest across the two languages. We find that anger, fear, pride and hope were the prime sentiments regarding intention to or support of protest, regardless of language. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; Egyptian social movement; Emotional and; Goal seeking pathways; Protest communication; Social media communications"

To put this new concept in context, we offer first a concise overview of related and complementary notions (e.g. happiness, satisfaction, well-being, quality of life, contentment). Then we propose a new departure for attractiveness research pertaining to micro-based information on residents or users of cities by introducing the notion of a ‘city-love production function’. This function expresses the ability of cities to enhance the love or appreciation for a city or its neighbourhoods through an appropriate combination of five specific ‘city capital’ constituents. We test the validity of this so-called ‘Pentagon’ approach to city love by means of the city-love production function using a multivariate econometric model based on extensive heterogeneous statistical data on municipalities in Sweden and complemented with cell phone data. Our results are confronted with empirical ‘big data’ on the appreciation of Swedish places – and their characteristics – taken from social media platforms. The study offers also interesting findings from an advanced spatial-econometric and multilevel modelling approach. Our estimations show that the concept of the city-love production function allows us to quantitatively uncover important determinants of citizens’ love for their local environment. © 2020 The Authors","Attractiveness; Big data; City capital; City love; Contentment; Happiness; Pentagon; Production function; Quality of life; Social media platform; Well-being"

Based on the speech act theory, we develop a theoretical framework that explains how the linguistic style (both at the word and the structural level) acts as a cue for assessing a reviewer's (in)sincere intentions. We evaluate the framework on a corpus of 120 online product reviews – each examined by at least 50 customers – using the fractional logit model. Results suggest that the communication style of a speaker reflects his/her intention.

In this study, we compared two indexes: Phi Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and Ochiai Coefficient (Och) based on their sensitivity to the sample size of transactions from where the network is inferred. For demonstration, we used an implicit network, called a comorbidity network, developed from health records of 22.1 million patients.

However, the literature on live streaming commerce, is scarce, and few studies examine how interactivity influences customers’ non-transactional behaviors from a dynamic perspective. In this setting, based on the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) framework, we developed a research model using real-time data to investigate the dynamic effect of interactivity on customer engagement behavior through tie strength in live streaming commerce, which is a relatively new derivative of social commerce. This study developed a text mining method to quantify constructs using a large-scale sample of 3,500,445 online review texts. Our empirical study found that interactivity has a curvilinear relationship with customer engagement behavior. Besides, tie strength plays an intermediary role between interactivity and customer engagement behavior.

However, for multinational mobile retailers (m-retailers), one of the greatest challenges lies in carefully managing their websites across multiple national markets. This work advances cross-national research on m-retailing by (1) examining how value dimensions shape m-shoppers’ motivations, (2) analyzing differential effects of hedonic and utilitarian motivations on intention and habit, and (3) examining the competing roles of conscious (intentional) and unconscious (habitual) m-commerce use drivers across developed and developing countries. This research also examines the moderating role of m-commerce readiness at the country level on the effect of motivation on intention and habit, along with their impact on m-commerce use. Based on data from 1,975 m-shoppers in nine countries (Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Pakistan, Singapore, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Vietnam) across four continents, the results demonstrate differential relationships: consumers at an advanced (early) readiness stage are more likely to be hedonism-motivated (utility-motivated) when using m-commerce and tend to use it intentionally/consciously (habitually/unconsciously). In addition to advancing knowledge about m-commerce from a scientific perspective, the findings can help multinational firms decide whether to standardize or adapt m-shopping experiences when internationalizing. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Habit; Hedonic versus utilitarian motivation; Mobile commerce; Perceived value; Stimulus-organism-response paradigm"

Smart cities rely on the deployment of information and communication technology (ICT) that is digitally transforming our habitats. Digital transformation affects several areas from transportation, energy, government to the environment. But, primarily, it affects citizens. Therefore, the adoption of all areas of the smart city holds great research potential. The purpose of this paper is thus to provide an insight into millennials’ adoption of autonomous vehicles (AV), which are at the forefront of future transport. Millennials are an important focus group for smart city concepts since they are keen to adopt technology and new transport modes. Our research focuses on technology adoption, perception of the benefits, security, safety, mobility-related efficiencies and concerns as the key AV adoption factors. The impact of these factors is empirically tested with structural equation modelling using data from 382 millennials. We confirm the perceived benefits of AV are vital factors for AV adoption whereas the perceived safety of AV significantly reduces the influence of various concerns regarding AV. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Autonomous vehicles; Digitalisation; ICT; Millennials; Smart city"

Thus, it is essential to understand how companies can extract value from consumers in social media brand communities. We develop a model clarifying the dual concept of consumer value and illustrating how consumer-perceived value can be transformed into consumer-generated value from a trust transfer perspective. Specifically, we identify three types of consumer-perceived value: utilitarian, hedonic, and social. We capture consumer-generated value in terms of purchase intention and social media word of mouth. Using a two-wave survey, our results strongly support the research model. Specifically, the three types of consumer-perceived values positively affect consumer trust in social media brand communities, which in turn leads to trust in brand and in social media and, thereafter, consumers’ subsequent social media word of mouth and purchase intentions. Our study makes several contributions to the strategic information systems literature concerning leveraging social media brand communities into business strategies. Theoretically, our study expands the understanding of the dual concept of consumer value in social media brand communities through the trust transfer theory. Practically, our study delivers insights for companies into how social media brand communities can be used as a strategic tool for achieving business values. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Business value; Consumer value; Social media brand community; Trust"

The changes that affect organizational communications, specifically marketing communications, remain unclear, especially in the context of business-to-business (B2B) organizations. The current trend is for B2B companies to view social media as an optimal way to enhance lasting and valuable relationships with other companies. There is little research on social media marketing strategies by B2B organizations. To fill this gap, this study uses a sample of 57 B2B ICOs completed by December 2019 and qualitative comparative analysis to examine how the combined effect of four conditions related to B2B ICOs (percentage of tokens distributed, amount of funding raised, minimum investment required, and ICO price) and two conditions related to the promoter's country (institutional efficiency and tax haven status) lead to a low Alexa Rank. While the percentage of tokens distributed and the amount of funds raised play a key role in achieving a low Alexa Rank, the minimum investment required seems to play a secondary role. Moreover, the importance of the characteristics of the B2B ICO promoter's country depends on both the presence and the value of the conditions related to financial characteristics. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Alexa rank; B2B; Digital marketing; ICOs"

Based on a holistic deliberation of AR Marketing and four studies with more than 2,000 respondents, this article investigates consumer acceptance of holographic AR substitutes for real products. The findings show fairly high acceptance rates for some product categories (e.g., Post-it notes, manuals, navigation technology) and low ones for others (e.g., pets, memorabilia). This study also identifies certain product and consumer characteristics (e.g., utilitarian benefits, not visible to others, digitalized products, familiarity with AR) as drivers of substitution.

This is not due to aging alone but also because we lead unhealthy lifestyles with little or no exercise and typically consume food with poor nutritional content. This paper proffers the design science research method to create an artefact that can help people study the diffusion of serious games. The ultimate goal of the study is to create a serious game that can help people to improve their balance in physical exercise, nutrition and well-being. To do this, first we conducted 97 interviews to study if wearables can be used for gathering health data. Analysis indicates that designers, manufacturers, and developers of wearables and associated software and apps should make their devices reliable, relevant, and user friendly. To increase the diffusion, adoption, and habitual usage of wearables key issues such as privacy and security need to be addressed as well. Then, we created a paper prototype and conducted a further 32 interviews to validate the first prototype of the game, especially with respect to the diffusion possibilities of the game. Results are positive from a formal technology acceptance point of view showing relevance and usefulness. But informally in the open questions some limitations also became visible. In particular, ease of use is extremely important for acceptance and calling it a game can in fact be an obstruction. Moreover, the artefact should not be patronizing and age differences can also pose problems, hence the title not to make the serious game too serious. Future research plans to address these problems in the next iteration while the future implementation plan seeks for big platforms or companies to diffuse the serious game. A key theoretical contribution of this research is the identification of habit as a potential dependent variable for the intention to use wearables and the development of a diffusion model for serious games. The hedonic perspective is added to the model as well as trust and perceived risks. This model ends the cycle of critical design with an improvement of theory as result contributing to the societal goal of decreasing Obesities and Diabetes. © 2020 The Authors","Adoption of IT; Diffusion; Mobile health; Serious gaming; Wearables"

Two elements need to be considered for smart cities to be successful. First, citizens must participate in the design of the smart city to take advantage of their ideas so that the smart city answers their real needs. Secondly, each city has its own unique characteristics that need to be considered to design a citizen participation strategy truly tailored and adapted to their respective context. In line with these two considerations, the goal of this paper is to identify the context factors that impact citizen participation strategies in smart cities. In order to reach that goal, we performed a qualitative case study of two cities that strive to be smart: Namur (Belgium) and Linköping (Sweden). This analysis allows us to understand how participation is implemented in two different cases and to infer the context factors that impact the respective strategies. Five context-factors have been identified in this study: the smart city consideration, the drivers for participation, the degree of centralization, the legal requirements, and the citizens’ characteristics. By identifying these factors, we can derive context-dependent recommendations about citizen participation for smart cities. These recommendations are then applied to the case of Brussels in Belgium. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Citizen participation; Context factors; Recommendations; Smart city"

Drawing upon the methodology from statistical text analysis research, this study summarizes the evolution of knowledge in this domain by examining the publication trends as per authors, institutions, countries, etc. Further, this study proposes a probabilistic generative model based on structural topic modeling to understand and extract the latent themes from the research articles related to information management. Furthermore, this study graphically visualizes the variations in the topic prevalences over the period of 1970 to 2019. The results highlight that the most common themes are data management, knowledge management, environmental management, project management, service management, and mobile and web management. The findings also identify themes such as knowledge management, environmental management, project management, and social communication as academic hotspots for future research. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Generative models; Information management; Structural topic models; Text analytics; Topic modeling"

Recent surveys show that up to 85 % of AI initiatives ultimately fail to deliver on their promises. Studies on successful AI applications that could provide invaluable lessons for organizations embarking on their AI journey are still lacking. Therefore, this study aims to understand how AI technology, people, and processes should be managed to successfully create value. Building on the resource orchestration perspective, this study analyzes the successful applications of AI at Alibaba's e-commerce fulfillment center. The findings indicate that the key AI resources include data, AI algorithms, and robots. These resources must be orchestrated (e.g., coordinated, leveraged, deployed) to work with other related resources, such as warehouse facilities and existing information systems, to generate strong AI capabilities. The key AI capabilities generated include forecasting, planning, and learning. More importantly, AI capabilities are not independent – they interact and coevolve with human capabilities to create business value in terms of efficiency (e.g., space optimization, labor productivity) and effectiveness (e.g., error reduction). The implications of understanding these social informatics of AI for research and practice are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; E-commerce; Fulfillment center; Resource orchestration; Smart warehouse"

However, not much attention has been paid to the effect of CRM on small or unknown online retailers. As ethical concerns about the Internet continue to rise, consumers' perceptions regarding the ethics of online retailers (CPEOR) become important when making a purchase decision. This research uses the self-signaling theory to examine how online retailers’ information management and promotional strategy (CRM vs. Price Discount) may emit signals and impact on the consumers’ repurchase intention. It was assumed that a high CPEOR would work better with a CRM-based strategy, which is fundamentally aligning in ethics. However, the experimental results surprisingly revealed that when CPEOR was high, the consumers’ repurchase intention increased in the case of a Price Discount-based promotion when compared to a CRM-based promotion; the effect was the opposite when consumers’ CPEOR was low. ANCOVA was used to analyze the data while setting certain variables as covariates. This research is a meaningful contribution to the literature and serves as an important reference for e-commerce practitioners to understand how they can wisely manage the information on the online storefront to signal their consumers and create an incremental value for the business. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cause-related marketing (CRM); Consumers’ perceptions regarding the ethics of online retailers (CPEOR); Price discount; Repurchase intention; Self-signaling; Theory"

Trust is an important indicator of mutual relationships that lead to successful projects. This study's objective is to investigate the determinants of trust in different stages of collaboration during offshore software-development outsourcing. Using a case study approach to collect data, we find that reputation, a cognition-based trust factor, influences clients’ trust in vendors in the team-forming stage. Responsible team climate, a knowledge-based trust factor, impacts clients’ trust in vendors in the team-storming and norming stages of software design and development. Structural assurance, an institutional trust factor, encourages vendors’ trust in clients in the same team-storming and norming stages of software design and development. Benefit, a calculative-based trust factor, influences vendors’ trust in clients in the team-performing stage of software delivery and implementation.

Even if only tacitly, the resultant debate increasingly oscillates around how the effective use of information and communication technology (ICT) might render cities and urban space better places. This article responds to this imperative by suggesting how to capture users’ views and perceptions of smart city services and applications and in this way enrich the decision- and policy-making processes. It is argued that by developing appropriate scales these otherwise subjective views and perceptions may be objectivized and hence made of great use to managers and policymakers. Accordingly, in this research, a process of scale development is conducted in four phases of both inductive and deductive methods. Following initial rounds of focus groups and assessment by experts, an international survey was conducted with 295 participants from Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Arab Peninsula, and other regions. The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 24 and AMOS 20 tools. The study proposes a 20-item scale in five distinct dimensions: Technology anxiety; Work–life interface; Engagement orientation; Support orientation; and Quality of life.

However, the selection of technology and policy for providing better services to citizens and ensuring sustainable development is a multiple-objective decision process that is usually performed by experts in relevant domains. The major goal of this study is to propose a structural method for policy selection, which consists of three phases. In the first phase, the modified Delphi method is used to determine the elements of the decision by surveying panel members for their opinions. In the second phase, an analytic hierarchy process is used to ascertain the priority of each alternative according to the goal of the decision. In the third phase, zero-one goal programming models are developed to select a feasible portfolio based on the political goal and the annual budget. We conducted an empirical study to demonstrate and validate that the proposed model can induce the municipality to consider citizens’ requirements, identify the strengths and weaknesses of proposed policies, and select a feasible project portfolio in response to public expectations. In addition, the study found that a feasible portfolio, including consideration of citizens, business, and the environment, enables the public perceptions of government performance within the resource constraints of the organization. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Analytical hierarchy process; Information and communication technologies; Modified Delphi method; Smart city concept; Zero-one goal programming"

First, we draw on the stimulus–organism–response (S–O–R) theory to introduce OBC website quality (termed OBC-SiteQUAL), alongside brand involvement as a customer resource input, to shape an expanded quadripartite CE conceptualisation. Second, using multi-country data, we test the validity of the OBC-SiteQUAL and CE measurement models, and the theoretical framework. Results indicate that the newly conceived OBC-SiteQUAL construct, underpinned by various web-based cues related to affective elements, brand interaction and customer-to-customer interaction, positively influences CE, whereas brand involvement partially influences CE. Third, we examine how these variables translate to behavioural loyalty outcomes. Empirically, a consistent pattern across the country samples indicates that OBC-SiteQUAL can affect behavioural loyalty by enhancing CE. Thus, we reliably confirm the mediating effect of CE (O) between OBC-SiteQUAL (S) and behavioural loyalty (R). Fourth, we found that the impact of OBC-SiteQUAL and brand involvement on CE differs between younger and older Gen Y consumers.

We apply fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to survey data to derive profiles of drivers who use their smartphone frequently while driving. Our results indicate that personality profiles affect smartphone use behavior while driving and that three equifinal profiles, i.e. distinct constellations of the big five personality traits, influence frequent smartphone use while driving. Interestingly, a single trait can be low in one profile and high in another profile and, depending on the other traits, both profiles might reflect drivers using their smartphone frequently. We contribute to the literature that frequent smartphone use while driving is, to some degree, grounded in personality and that just looking at singular traits can yield misleading results.

We find that the higher an individual perceives one's information literacy, the more he or she trusts the website, and this is mediated by one's perceived information overload (negatively) and perceived usefulness (positively).

We implement the conceptual model in six different data stores: two RDF triple stores (Jena TDB and Virtuoso), one graph-oriented NoSQL database (Neo4j), one column-oriented data store (Cassandra), and two relational databases (MySQL and PostGreSQL). We compare the querying performance, with and without aggregates, in these data stores. Experimental results, on real-world datasets containing 81.92 million triplets, show that pre-aggregation allows for reducing query runtime in all data stores. Neo4j NoSQL and relational databases with aggregates outperform triple stores speeding up to 99% query runtime. © 2020","Data analytics; Graph aggregation; NoSQL; Statistical RDF data"

In order to support smart government in decision making, information systems have been developed to monitor and predict CO2 emissions. Most of the existing studies investigate CO2 emission amounts, identify influencing factors of CO2 emission and discuss potential suggestions to mitigate CO2 emission for different industries. They often focus on CO2 emission research of industries in a region or country, while the integration of carbon flow in the neighboring regions is not well studied. Therefore, this paper proposes a system dynamics model to explore an optimal carbon emission reduction path of a regional industry by integrating regional differences, i.e., industrial comparative advantages, technology advantages and the inter-regional context between the neighboring regions. In the case study, we use a key industry in a typical industrial region of Western China, the cement industry in Chongqing, as a scenario to simulate the CO2 emission, possible energy demand and cement production of the cement industry in this region for recent years. Simulation results show that by leveraging the regional differences, especially the collaboration of the industrial chain and production capacity among regions, the cement industry in Chongqing can achieve the low-carbon target. In addition, through the analysis and discussions about the features of our model and Chongqing's cement industry, it reflects that our model using regional differences is applicable to industries with a common demand market at the regional level such as energy, chemical and steel industries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; Low-carbon development; Regional industry; Scenarios analysis; System dynamics"

The lack of a consensus on privacy protection in the contact tracing process creates risks of non-compliance or deliberate obfuscation from citizens who fear revealing private aspects of their lives – a factor greatly exacerbated by recent major scandals over online privacy and the illicit use of citizens’ digital information, which have heightened public consciousness of these issues and created significant new challenges for any collection of large-scale public data.

The Blockchain technology outweighs the challenges associated with the traditional transaction business governed and regulated by the third trusted party. There is a growth in the interest among the researchers, the industry, and the academia to study and leverage the potential of Blockchain. Blockchain provides a decentralized and distributed public ledger for all the participating parties. Though it seems that blockchain is a viable choice and solution for all the centralized governed and regulated transactions (in digital online space), it has potential challenges that need to be resolved; opportunities to be explored, and applications to be studied. This paper utilizes a systematic literature review to study several research endeavors made in the domain of blockchain. To further research on blockchain adoption, the paper theoretically constructs an integrated framework of the blockchain innovation adoption process in an organization considering organizational and user acceptance perspectives. This would facilitate its widespread adoption, thereby achieving sustained leadership solutions. The paper offers 23 propositions to information systems (IS)/information management (IM) scholars with respect to innovation characteristics, organizational characteristics, environmental characteristics, and user acceptance characteristics.

Using the strong theoretical background of the well-known technology acceptance model (TAM), this paper proposes and empirically validates a model that fits the social and technical nature of social tagging tools within the public sector. The analyses in this paper were based on data collected from a large survey of more than 480 respondents working for two public organizations in the United States. The findings demonstrate a significant impact of the role of social presence in encouraging employees to create and share content. Further, there is a strong relationship between the benefits employees receive from using tagging tools and their creation and sharing of tagged content. Specifically, the following factors showed a significant impact on employees’ creation and sharing behavior, specifically their attitudes towards and intentions to create and share tags: perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, social presence, and pro-sharing norms. For researchers, the paper offers an opportunity to further study knowledge-sharing behavior regarding social media technologies. The findings should motivate practitioners to inject these tools with a social aspect so that employees are encouraged to share content. © 2020","altruism; Knowledge-sharing attitude and intention; perceived ease of use information refindability; pro-sharing norms; social presence"

Degradation of the natural environment and the climate crisis are exceedingly complex phenomena requiring the most advanced and innovative solutions. Aiming to spur groundbreaking research and practical solutions of AI for environmental sustainability, we argue that AI can support the derivation of culturally appropriate organizational processes and individual practices to reduce the natural resource and energy intensity of human activities. The true value of AI will not be in how it enables society to reduce its energy, water, and land use intensities, but rather, at a higher level, how it facilitates and fosters environmental governance. A comprehensive review of the literature indicates that research regarding AI for sustainability is challenged by (1) overreliance on historical data in machine learning models, (2) uncertain human behavioral responses to AI-based interventions, (3) increased cybersecurity risks, (4) adverse impacts of AI applications, and (5) difficulties in measuring effects of intervention strategies. The review indicates that future studies of AI for sustainability should incorporate (1) multilevel views, (2) systems dynamics approaches, (3) design thinking, (4) psychological and sociological considerations, and (5) economic value considerations to show how AI can deliver immediate solutions without introducing long-term threats to environmental sustainability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agenda for practice; AI; Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Environmental governance; Natural environment; Research agenda; Sustainability"

This research adopts a quantitative approach and collects data from 530 respondents. The proposed model is tested using structural equation modelling. The empirical results obtained suggest that IB adoption is positively influenced by the levels of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions while perceived risk negatively influences IB usage intention. IB intention was found to positively impact usage behavior which ultimately impacts customer satisfaction. This study also reveals that uncertainty avoidance dampens the influence of performance expectancy and facilitating conditions on IB adoption intention.

This activity has been recognised by both TV media executives and academia as ‘second screen’ activity. This paper develops and tests a ‘parasocial interaction-impulse buying’ - model that captures the behaviours of consumers watching a Chinese TV drama series. These audience-consumers were also engaging extensively (most on a daily basis) during the broadcast period with series related influencer social media activities on a second screen. A structural equation model was developed to analyse the data. Findings indicate that TV series audience consumers who are also highly engaged with influencer- consumer ‘second screen’ content are likely to experience positive narrative involvement leading to engagement in parasocial interaction behaviours and ultimately impulse buying behaviour. These findings have implications for managers by providing insights into (1) the effects of influencer second screen content (2) the processes by which consumers’ involvement in a TV show's narrative leads to impulse buying of products. Thus, influencer related second screen consumer engagement should be considered a significant opportunity for marketers, as such activity makes consumers become more involved in the characters and the narrative of a particular TV show, leading to increased impulse buying. © 2020","Impulse buying; Multi-channel mobile marketing; Narrative involvement; Parasocial interaction; Second screen; Social media"

Our hypotheses were tested using survey data from 235 Chinese government employees. Results not only confirm the direct effect of SSG on government employees’ ISP compliance but also suggest that SSG indirectly influences compliance behavior via the mediation of organizational commitment. Organizational commitment weakens the negative influence of perceived costs on compliance behavior and also weakens the positive effect of self-efficacy on employees’ ISP compliance. For low-commitment employees, the negative influence of perceived costs on compliance behavior is more significant than that of those with strong organizational commitment, and self-efficacy exerts a stronger effect on ISP compliance for low-commitment employees than it does for high-commitment employees.

This problem remains a hot topic, especially nowadays when information technologies are highly integrated into the educational process. Such a problem is essential for those institutions that rely on e-learning strategies as various techniques for the same teaching activities and disciplines are now available online. In order to effectively predict the quality of this type of (electronic) educational process we suggest to use one of the well known machine learning techniques. In particular, a proposed approach relies on using logic circuits/networks for such prediction. Given an electronic service providing a teaching strategy, the mathematical model of logic circuits is used for evaluating the student's level of proficiency. Given two (or more) logic circuits that predict the student's educational proficiency using different electronic services (teaching strategies), we also propose a method for synthesizing the resulting logic circuit that predicts the effectiveness of the teaching process when two given strategies are combined. The proposed technique can be effectively used in the educational management when the best (online) teaching strategy should be chosen based on student's goals, individual features, needs and preferences. As an example of the technique proposed in the paper, we consider an educational process of teaching foreign languages at one of Russian universities. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate the expected scalability and applicability of the proposed approach. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Educational management; Evaluation/estimation/prediction; Level of proficiency; Logic network/circuit; Teaching strategy"

Data collected from 159 IS organizations confirmed our hypotheses, showing that effects on digital service innovation are mediated by an organization's digital service climate and co-creation practices. This study makes four major contributions. First, our results contribute to the literature on service-dominant logic and the role of institutional arrangements in facilitating service innovation in service ecosystems. Second, our study offers a novel understanding of PRFs’ role in value co-creation and digital service innovation. Third, by introducing the digital service climate from existing theoretical frameworks that might assist in conceptualizing the role of culture and shared meaning, our study contributes to further theorizing on the social factors that influence service ecosystem practices.

The findings indicate that pre-adoption performance/effort expectancies impact consumption-driven confirmation, which in turn affects the post-adoption perceived usefulness, post-adoption perceived security, and user satisfaction. Further, satisfaction, post-adoption self-efficacy and post-adoption perceived usefulness are found to be strong antecedents of the user's continuance intention.

One prominent way to combat these losses is crowdfunding. Donation-based crowdfunding platforms have been the backbone for disaster relief operations (DRO), but the engagement of donors with these platforms needs significant attention. This study aims to understand how gamification is used as a tool for understanding the behaviour of donors on crowdfunding platforms for DRO. The study uses the Civic Voluntary Model (CVM) to propose the conceptual framework and collects empirical data from 321 respondents to test the hypothesis. The study uses information quality and voluntariness as moderating variables and the model also controls for ownership of the crowdfunding platform and previous experience of donation. The results confirm that gamification positively impacts the behaviour of donors, which then leads to higher participation in crowdfunding channels. Both information quality and voluntary behaviour of donors have significant moderating effects that help in understanding the behaviour of donors and their participation in crowdfunding platforms. The results indicate that previous experience of making donations does not have a significant impact on the behaviour and actions of donors. The study thus brings a fresh perspective to using game mechanics along with understanding the quality of information on crowdfunding platforms to attract and sustain donations in DRO. © 2020","Crowdfunding; Disaster Relief Operations (DRO); Gamification; Information quality; Voluntariness"

The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that would help the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) of India to adopt Social Media Marketing (SMM) mechanisms for improving their business impact. Adoption of SMM by SMEs has considerable impact on the improvement of business outcome of the SMEs. A theoretical model has been developed with the help of theory borrowed from TAM and UTAUT2 with some modifications to explore this impact through business performance, sales, connect with customers, identify customer' needs and creativity of the employees. The theoretical model has been validated empirically using a survey of 310 firms and subsequent analysis have been carried out using structured equation modelling. The results highlight that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and compatibility positively affect impact of SMM after adoption by the SMEs. The facilitating conditions have insignificant impact whereas cost has a significant but negative impact on the use of SMM by SMEs. Since there are a few studies in this context, the study contributes to existing literature on the impact of SMM in SMEs in an emerging economy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Digital marketing; Small and medium enterprises; Social media impact; Social media marketing; Technology impact"

Though previous studies have explored various nuances of customer behaviour towards mobile commerce applications, this study majorly aims to understand the drivers of repurchase intention and satisfying experience in an m-commerce shopping environment. The study follows the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) theoretical approach. A cross-sectional design was adopted for this study involving data from 420 regular mobile shoppers in India through a non-probabilistic sampling procedure. The collected data were later analysed using structural equation modeling. The results indicate perceived ubiquity and m-commerce app incentives as two strongest predictors of impulsiveness and perceived value respectively. It was further observed that impulsiveness negatively affects consumers repurchase intention but positively enhances the satisfying experience, whereas perceived value favourably affects both the variable. The study contributes in various ways; first, a holistic model using the S-O-R framework is a new addition in literature ground; second, the extra focus on the construct satisfying experience will give a larger understanding to optimise the m-commerce applications efficiently.

In this context, interoperability has become a prerequisite in the jigsaw of such collaboration. By definition, it is entities’ ability to work together as an organisation. This ability spans a wide range of aspects, embracing both technical and business issues. Over the past decade, both the concept and the context of interoperability have been extended from a largely IT-focused domain to a business-focused domain and the evaluation of interoperability has become a rising concern. An increasing number of studies have concentrated on not just digital but business aspects of human behaviour in the social environment. In general, the wider application domain is the assessment of the interoperability of information systems and processes in any organisation (especially medium and large) that needs multiple processes to interact effectively. To deal with such concerns and pave the way to achievement of more effective collaborative goals in business, the concept of interoperability has been adopted to measure the efficiency and productivity of information systems’ integration. More than twenty approaches have so far been adopted to evaluate this interoperability, however most are unable to assess it at the higher levels, such as at the pragmatic, process and social levels. Hence, we have conducted a three-phase study. Phase 1 reviewed existing interoperability evaluation approaches. To prove the concept, phase 2 proposed the concept of semiotic interoperability and its application to healthcare information systems. This article reports on the third phase of the study, a proposed framework with a group of metrics to measure interoperability from a new perspective – a semiotics perspective. The framework is named the Semiotic Interoperability Evaluation Framework (the SIEF) and has the ability to analyse, measure and assess the interoperability among business processes. The metrics derive from a feasibility study to investigate several interoperability barriers at a hospital. Next, the SIEF was applied in a case study and a detailed interoperability evaluation was conducted. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Business process; Information sharing; Interoperability evaluation; Semiotic interoperability"

While China's challenges with various standard initiatives to the global standards regime peaked in the 5G dispute have attracted public interests, scholarly approach to the dispute is still limited. We place the dispute in the context of China's long-standing attempts for international standardization in ICT sectors. With enhanced economic power, China has pursued for pushing indigenous technologies into international standards, which has been a core part of its national science and technology (S&T) policy. This paper examines China's international standard initiatives from the perspective of techno-nationalism. Our literature review identifies three pillars of techno-nationalism: state empowerment, growth orientation, and global connection. Then we investigate three cases of WAPI, TD-SCDMA and 5G and discuss how the patterns of developing international standards have varied in the framework of techno-nationalism. Over time, China's international standard initiatives based on techno-nationalism have strengthened global connection and growth orientation, with increasing proximity to techno-nationalism of the Western style. In particular, China's aspiration for growth orientation was much enhanced with the 5G standard initiative, compared to WAPI or TD-SCDMA, as it aims to be the first mover in the 5G race. Overall, our study suggests that China's national S&T policy has been moving from the ‘catch-up’ to the ‘first-mover’ strategy, but the transformation continues to take place in the framework of techno-nationalism. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","5G; China; Standardization; TD-SCDMA; Techno-nationalism; WAPI"

Formulating IT governance mechanisms is important for governments to perform their responsibilities and maximize public value. As service arrangers, governments’ actions are affected by complex external environments for legitimacy, which has been largely ignored in the existing studies. By incorporating the strategic and institutional perspectives of legitimacy into Savas's service delivery structure, this study developed a triadic framework that accounts for different contextual determinants related to the external market environment and the institutional environment to investigate the formulation of IT governance mechanisms. A survey involving 329 town-level governments in Beijing, China, was done to validate our research model. The results illustrate that the demand-supply market forces have direct impacts on IT governance mechanism formulation in local governments. Institutional pressures exert a mediating effect by transiting the supply market force into governments’ actions. Our triadic framework reveals a dynamic service delivery structure, contributing to Savas's service delivery structure and IT governance research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Institutional pressures; IT governance mechanisms; IT-enabled senior care; Legitimacy perspectives; Service delivery structure"

Sentiment analysis, a text mining technique, is used to analyze and extract emotions from an unstructured P2P loan data set. The results reveal valuable information in the P2P lending context such that, in the absence of market interest rates, borrowers can improve the chance of funding success by improving the textual quality of their loan descriptions in terms of readability and linguistic correctness. In addition, borrowers can make the loan descriptions more attractive to potential lenders by expressing certain emotions in the descriptions. © 2020","Emotion; Microfinancing; P2P lending; Sentiment analysis; Text mining"

SHTs can offer a broad spectrum of potential functional, experiential and esthetic benefits, yet much of the prior research on the adoption of SHTs has been limited by a narrow TAM-based functional view. Relatively little is known about the salient user beliefs related to the experiential and esthetic benefits of SHTs that may affect SHT adoption. To address this gap in research, we conduct a mixed-methods study, wherein we inductively develop a set of factors that reflect salient user considerations associated with smart thermostats and we examine the effects of the elicited factors on the smart thermostat adoption intention. We find that performance expectancy, emphasized by TAM, has a relatively minor effect on the smart thermostat adoption intention and effort expectancy has no effect at all. We identify a novel factor, which we term techno-coolness, as the key predictor of the adoption intention in this context. Techno-coolness is a multidimensional construct that encompasses the perceptions that the technology can make a home look modern and futuristic, can make the user feel technologically advanced, and can be fun to use. Techno-coolness reveals that the technology capacity to fulfill higher-order psychological needs can dominate purely functional considerations in innovative technology adoption decisions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Compatibility; Smart home; Techno-coolness; Technology adoption"

The diagnosis of depression is usually done by clinicians based on mental status questionnaires and patient's self-reporting. Not only do these methods highly depend on the current mood of the patient, but also people who experience mental illness are often reluctantly seeking help. Social networks have become a popular platform for people to express their feelings and thoughts with friends and family. With the substantial amount of data in social networks, there is an opportunity to try designing novel frameworks to identify those at risk of depression. Moreover, such frameworks can provide clinicians and hospitals with deeper insights about depressive behavioral patterns, thereby improving diagnostic process. In this paper, we propose a big data analytics framework to detect depression for users of social networks. In addition to syntactic and syntax features, it focuses on pragmatic features toward modeling the intention of users. User intention represents the true motivation behind social network behaviors. Moreover, since the behaviors of user's friends in the network are believed to have an influence on the user, the framework also models the influence of friends on the user's mental states. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on a massive real dataset obtained from Facebook and show that the framework outperforms existing methods for diagnosing user-level depression in social networks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Depression detection; Social influence analysis; Social network; User intention modeling"

To make suggestions based on explicit and judicious use of the best available evidence, a meta-analytic review was undertaken. In the present review, 16 electronic databases were searched up to July 2019, empirical results of 71 primary studies that met inclusion criteria were coded, and seven antecedents that commonly affect HIS behavior were examined. We obtained 204 correlation coefficients from 90 independent subsets with a total of 74,171 respondents. The results indicated that self-efficacy (ESr = 0.254), health literacy (ESr = 0.222), availability (ESr = 0.412), credibility (ESr = 0.308), emotional response (ESr = 0.090), and subjective norms (ESr = 0.443) substantially influenced individuals’ HIS, and subjective norms was the most influential factor. Individuals’ behavior usually aligns with the opinions of other critical individuals in their lives, and this phenomenon was observed in the present study of the HIS context. In addition, eight variables were examined as potential moderators (i.e., roles of samples, gender, average age, topic, information channel, type of publication, data collecting method, and sampling method); statistically significant effects on some of the aggregated correlations were noted for all of these variables. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Contextual factors; Effect sizes; Health information seeking; Meta-analysis; Personal factors"

The advent of artificial intelligence has also instilled the feeling of distress and ambiguity among employees regarding their future. Such confusion has triggered a plethora of deliberations surrounding the possible receptivity and hostility towards these modern technologies in the digital era where people are articulating their opinions and experiences through social media communication. This study explores the antecedents of employees’ intention to accept robotics at workplace using two-step analyses: Twitter Analysis and Survey-based analysis. Around 121,750 tweets from 43,000 Twitter handles were evaluated in the form of descriptive analysis, geospatial analysis, network analysis and sentiment analysis. Thereafter, the conceptual model has been formulated and validated based on the extracted themes (anthropomorphism, technophobia and behavioral intention to accept robotics at workplace) by including 864 responses from an online survey conducted in India. The findings corroborated that anthropomorphism and technophobia significantly influence behavioral intention, and technophobia acts as a significant competitive mediator. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","anthropomorphism; robotics; technophobia; Twitter Analytics; workplace"

With the advances in Information Technology, customer data comes not only from surveys and focus groups but also from social media and networking sites. Few studies have focused on developing algorithms that are devised exclusively to help to understand customer needs from big opinion data. Topic mining, aspect-based sentiment analysis and word embedding are some of the techniques adopted to identify CNs from text data. However, most of them do not consider the possibility that part of the customer data analysed is already known by companies. With the aim to continuously enhance company understanding of CNs, this paper presents an autonomous methodology for automatically classifying a set of text data (customer sentences) as referring to known or unknown CN statements by the company. For verification purposes, an example regarding a set of customer answers from an open survey questionnaire regarding the climate system of a car is illustrated.

Consumers increasingly rely on the opinions and recommendations from social media members when making purchasing decisions. However, information received from social media may have different meanings and social implications for consumers. Based on the theory of informational social influence and heuristic-systematic model (HSM), we develop a model to understand the relative importance of informational social influence, normative social influence, and perceived information quality on the consumer's social shopping intention under different levels of product involvement. The results of the structural equation modeling (SEM) using a sample of 503 consumers in the Facebook brand fan pages indicate that social influences have a greater impact on the consumer's social shopping intention than perceived information quality. Three social interactional factors (perceived similarity, familiarity, and expertise) have a positive effect on social shopping intention via the mediation of informational, normative social influence and perceive information quality. The multiple-group analysis suggests that high product-involved consumers are motivated to exert more cognitive effort to evaluate the product information. In contrast, low product-involved consumers are more susceptible to informational social influence. We draw on these findings to offer implications for researchers and practitioners. © 2020","Heuristic-systematic model; Informational social influence; Normative social influence; Social interaction; Social shopping intention"

It is becoming the dominant privacy protection pattern. Considered to be a promising development tendency towards the information industry, it is garnering interest among researchers and professionals. However, PbD still lacks specific implementation instructions, and it is not popularized among information system engineers. Weighing the pros and cons leads to information system engineers’ uncertainty regarding PbD adoption, since existing research on the linkage between PbD implementation and information system engineers’ individual factors is inconclusive. Through the lenses of information system engineers, this study aims to advance implementation of PbD by exploring the influence factors of individual and organizational contexts. Real data from 253 practitioners in China's IT industry were used to understand the antecedent of PbD implementation and interaction effects among different dimensions of engineers’ adopting behaviors. The findings have demonstrated that appropriate incentive mechanism is a critical factor in PbD implementation by promoting engineer's social influence regarding PbD usage and further affecting both their intentions about adopting PbD and implementing action. This study reveals, for the first time, the role of incentive mechanism in advancing PbD implementation from the information system engineer perspective, and contributes to a deeper understanding of the determinants of PbD adoption by providing a holistic theoretical lens.

In some markets, cash is already being replaced by digital transactions, but consumers of many developing countries are slower in transition towards digital payments. This study aims to identify major determinants of consumer mobile payment adoption in India the country with second largest mobile subscribers in the world. Existing mobile payments adoption studies have predominantly utilised Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which was primarily developed in organisational context and criticised for having deterministic approach without much consideration for users’ individual characteristics. Therefore, this study adapted meta-UTAUT model with individual difference variable attitude as core construct and extended the model with consumer related constructs such as personal innovativeness, anxiety, trust, and grievance redressal. Empirical examination of the model among 491 Indian consumers revealed performance expectancy, intention to use, and grievance redressal as significant positive predictor of consumer use behaviour towards mobile payment. Moreover, intention to use was significantly influenced by attitude, social influence, and facilitating conditions. The major contribution of this study includes re-affirming the central role of attitude in consumer adoption studies and examining usage behaviour in contrast to most existing studies, which examine only behavioural intention. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adoption; Meta-UTAUT; Mobile payment; TAM; Use behaviour"

There is a pressing need to examine why researchers hesitate to store, annotate, share and manage their research data. To model underlying psychological factors influencing researchers’ refusal to conduct RDM, the social exchange theory is extended with elements from prospect theory. Thus, it allows psychological insights into researchers’ decision-making, and illustrates the role of cost and benefit evaluations under uncertainty. Data management policies of a major funding agency were presented to a homogeneous group of researchers from the Information Systems community in Germany. The findings show that many researchers see a high value in RDM but are still held back by uncertainty. While the benefits seem to outweigh the costs, we ascertain the uncertainty factors which hinder researchers’ intention from conducting RDM in the future. The perceived fear of losing control over one's data is identified as a major hindering factor, while the fear of losing one's unique value did not prevail.

While online gamers actively participate in gaming teams, no study has yet explored whether gamers have sufficient teamwork knowledge and have accumulated sufficient team participation experience. These likely strengthen team commitment, but we do not know, indicating a research gap. Research filling this gap could shed light on useful means for enhancing gamers’ team commitment. Grounded in social identity theory, we theorize the mechanism that links gamers’ overall gaming team participation experience and overall gaming teamwork knowledge to their team commitment. We collect two-wave data from 344 online gamers that have played massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) and use structural equation modelling for data analysis. We find that overall team participation experience is positively related to gaming team identification, while overall teamwork knowledge is positively related to compliance with gaming team norms.

Whereas this transition may bring many advantages on an organizational level, related studies show that shop floor workers feel less able to maintain close contact with others and exchange awareness cues. Their diminished social connectedness has consequences on the personal (e.g., reduced satisfaction) and organizational (reduced efficiency) level. The current wave of digitization brings ample opportunities for companies to bring their employees closer together again. In order to identify such opportunities, we have studied the shop floor production practices of an automotive OEM (original equipment manufacturer) for nearly two years. Following a scenario-based action design science approach, we have developed problem and activity scenarios as well as a prototype that helps the workers to improve their social connectedness in three different scenarios. Eight weeks of use demonstrated the prototype's positive impact on the employees’ social connectedness by allowing for social appraisal and by improving their sense of sharing and involvement. Our results show which information technology (IT) design elements can contribute to social connectedness on the shop floor. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Information sharing; Information technology; Manufacturing processes; Shop floor; Social network"

The approach is based on a review of audit methods from information sciences and management, knowledge management and the engineering discipline and tested with data (N = 580) collected from the engineering domain within an automotive supplier over six European sites. The integrated assessment uses content needs profiles from two complementary perspectives, the coverage of needs by various internal information sources and data on awareness and usage of these information sources. The employment of content categories on a more granular analytical level than information systems sources opens up new possibilities to derive improvement measures and requirements for the design of information systems within an organization. The brief data-gathering instrument also reduces the required resources to implement this approach considerably overcoming weaknesses previously identified in case studies and the IA literature.

Most countries of the world have imposed restrictions on social congregations or even people working in close proximity to each other. Industries that produce and deliver information products and services therefore, have continued to function while those that manufacture physical products especially labor-intensive firms were forced to minimize operations or temporarily shut down. However, in most countries, physical products which were essential in nature were reluctantly permitted to be manufactured given the need for them in people's everyday life.

Technologies can also be catalysts of change. While digital technologies are playing a vital role in tackling the covid-19 pandemic, the pandemic also presents a significant opportunity for digital technologies. Some experts believe the pandemic may permanently normalise the comprehensive societal use of digital technologies. This article casts a critical eye over the potential implications of this opportunity in the context of information systems (IS) research and development. We introduce and outline selected principles of Zygmunt Bauman's theory of liquid modernity. We then apply the liquid-modern principles to illustrative examples drawn from the covid-19 literature by focussing on three areas of established information systems interest: control, big data and information privacy. We show that traditional conceptualisations of scientific and societal order and control need to be reassessed; that big data alone cannot order clear and safe paths out of the current crisis and that information privacy regulations are irrelevant when undermined or circumvented by public and private actors. We conclude by making four recommendations for IS pandemic researchers and five practical recommendations in the context of the pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Change; Covid-19; Information systems; Liquid modernity; Order"

Unfortunately, however, many organisations are often being seduced by the purported benefits of disruptive technologies often based on embellished or even falsified claims. This is particularly true in construction, where organisations are being required to embrace disruptive technologies (e.g. Building Information Modelling and Industry 4.0) to address performance and productivity issues. Unsubstantiated claims about expected benefits subvert the justification and benefits realisation process as the change management that is required is downplayed or ignored. It is, therefore, imperative that the business case as part of the process of evaluation, is based on evidence to enable the development of a change management and implementation strategy. In this paper, we present an overview of a longitudinal line of inquiry that sought to examine the benefits of disruptive technology, namely Systems Information Modelling (SIM). Our research revealed that more than a 90 % cost reduction to document electrical systems and a corresponding improvement in productivity was achieved. We suggest that engaging in the process of critical thinking, possessing a conscious awareness and healthy scepticism of technology places organisations in a position of control. As a consequence, organisations are better-positioned to understand the nature of technology and ‘how’ value can be generated from potential new ways of working. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Benefits; Disruptive technology; Information management; Productivity; Systems information modelling"

Their ability to be agile and adaptive has been stressed, particularly in regard to the timing of policy measures, the level of decision centralization, the autonomy of decisions and the balance between change and stability. In this contribution we use our observations of responses to COVID-19 to reflect on agility and adaptive governance and provide tools to evaluate it after the dust has settled. Whereas agility relates mainly to the speed of response within given structures, adaptivity implies system-level changes throughout government. Existing institutional structures and tools can enable adaptivity and agility, which can be complimentary approaches. However, agility sometimes conflicts with adaptability. Our analysis points to the paradoxical nature of adaptive governance. Indeed, successful adaptive governance calls for both decision speed and sound analysis, for both centralized and decentralized decision-making, for both innovation and bureaucracy, and both science and politics. © 2020","Adaptive governance; Adaptivity; Agile governance; Agile organization; COVID-19; Pandemic; Response; SARS-CoV-2"

We aimed to investigate this complexity in the research on IT engagement by examining its potential antecedents and outcomes in organizations. Considering the potentially mixed outcomes, we developed a model to examine the effects of IT engagement on personal productivity and strain. We also aimed to explain the antecedents of IT engagement by drawing on the collective expectations for IT use. In particular, we examined the extent to which normative pressure on IT use drives users’ information load and IT engagement. Finally, we sought to understand whether users’ attempts to avert dependency on IT use reduced their IT engagement.

However, in this media, attention is often restricted towards primary purpose only as a result of the level of interactivity, thereby affecting consumer response towards the advertisement(ad). In this setting, the study analyzes the role of media interactivity and the effects it has on the reaction of customers towards the social media ad. Further, the study also introduces the conditional role of message relevant aspects, such as message vividness and anthropomorphism, and examines the intervening role of flow experience. Results from a between-subjects study indicate that interactivity hurts the consumer ad reactions. It also suggests that the right use of message relevant aspects can mitigate these adverse effects. Thus, the study makes a significant contribution to the literature and practice regarding the effects of social media interactivity which is relatively recent and has been overlooked by past researchers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropomorphism; Attention; Interactivity; Recall; Recognition; Social media; Vividness"

The dynamics of interactions on social platforms such as Twitter promote the development of social movements around hashtags, such as #MeToo. According to previous research, this movement has set the beginning of an era. The present study aims to determine the key indicators of social identity in the #MeToo movement in Twitter using textual analysis and sentiment analysis of user-generated content. To this end, we use a cognitive pragmatics point of view to study a corpus of 31.305 tweets. Using the methodological approaches of corpus linguistics (CL) and discourse analysis (DA), we identify keywords, topics, frequency, and n-grams or collocations to understand the social identity of the #MeToo movement. The key indicators of the social identity in the #MeToo Era are validated using association statistical measures of Log-Likelihood and Mutual Information (MI). Our results reveal the polarization of sentiments where UGC is associated with both negative and positive topics. The social identity is particularly strongly correlated with women and the workplace.

A design science research (DSR) approach is adopted to develop design propositions (the artifact), following the context-intervention-mechanism-outcome logic (CIMO-logic). The design propositions are derived for DPs that can support different types of generative mechanisms of social interaction: information sharing, collaboration, and collective action. The design propositions are obtained by balancing empirical knowledge based on interviews performed with IBAs and SMEs in Portugal and in the UK, with theoretical knowledge from the literature of information systems, DPs and collaborative networks (CNs). The utility of the design propositions is further evaluated by experts and IBAs. The findings are proved to be relevant for practice, mainly for IBAs, SMEs, and digital platform designers to develop more effective collaborative DPs and sociotechnical systems, supporting CNs and the internationalisation needs of SMEs.

This study also categorizes and examines the moderating effects exerted by the genres of digital influencers’ revenue models, which represent a vital contextual factor for forming followers’ stickiness. A survey was conducted on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent to Twitter, with a sample of 319 followers of real digital influencers that are using different genres of revenue models.

The study was undertaken in two stages: (i) interviews in 2016 that examine the barriers and drivers of diffusion; followed by (ii) a case study in 2019 of the Italian wine industry's permissioned blockchain. The results show that diffusion is reaching a final stage for permissionless blockchains but is lagging behind for permissioned blockchains due to the different barriers and drivers of diffusion. The implications from this study are that: (i) drivers and barriers for different types of technological innovation may be different and change over time; (ii) initial barriers may be surmounted and become features of the underlying technology; (iii) barriers may become drivers of a technology; (iv) drivers of one type of technology may spill-over to become drivers for another type; (v) diffusion may be measured by both the number of adoptions and the number of participants in that technology; (vi) off-chain processes may become a major barrier for permissioned blockchains; and finally (vii) self-interest may be the key driver of technological innovation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Barriers; Blockchains; Diffusion; Drivers; Permissioned blockchains; Permissionless blockchains"

In France, despite heated public institutional debate on privacy related issues, the app was presented by government as an essential benefit for protecting health and lives, thus avoiding both politicians and citizens to feel morally responsible and looking guilty, and as essential to recover our freedom to move. However we argue that, while detection of cases have still not been reported after 10 days and one million app downloads - a situation comparable to Australia who launched its app a month before -, the adoption of the app generates important risks to our informational privacy, surveillance and habituation to security policies. It also may create discrimination, distrust and generate other health problems such as addiction and others as 5G technology continues to be deployed without prior impact studies. Finally the smartphone app against covid epidemics appears as an extreme case of the privacy paradox where the government plays on the immediate benefits and downplays long-term concerns while inducing a technology of self.

However, there is a growing concern about the credibility of disaster tweets. This concern negatively influences Twitter users’ decisions about whether to retweet information, which can delay the dissemination of accurate—and sometimes essential—communications during a crisis. Although verifying information credibility is often a time-consuming task requiring considerable cognitive effort, researchers have yet to explore how people manage this task while using Twitter during disaster situations. To address this, we adopt the Heuristic-Systematic Model of information processing to understand how Twitter users make retweet decisions by categorizing tweet content as systematically processed information and a Twitter user's profile as heuristically processed information. We then empirically examine tweet content and Twitter user profiles, as well as how they interact to verify the credibility of tweets collected during two disaster events: the 2011 Queensland floods, and the 2013 Colorado floods. Our empirical results suggest that using a Twitter profile as source-credibility information makes it easier for Twitter users to assess the credibility of disaster tweets. Our study also reveals that the Twitter user profile is a reliable source of credibility information and enhances our understanding of timely communication on Twitter during disasters. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Disaster communication; Heuristic-Systematic Model (HSM) of information processing; Source credibility; Twitter; Twitter user profile"

However, many organisations do not realise that successful digital transformation (DT) requires much more than technology; it can only succeed if they manage their data, information and knowledge as true business assets. This paper describes collaborative research conducted by academic and industry partners, a mutually beneficial journey spanning the past ten years. The aim was to develop a Holistic Information Asset Management (HIAM) model indicating the important areas of information asset management (IAM) that support the DT journey. Interviews were conducted with C-level executives in organisations from all industries on three continents to investigate their IAM practices, the barriers to good IAM and the benefits of managing information assets (IAs) well. This paper proposes that organisations should focus on ten domains in their quest for effective IAM: i) business benefits, ii) business environment, iii) executive awareness, iv) leadership and management, v) information environment, vi) information systems, vii) information behaviour, viii) information attributes/quality, ix) information performance and x) justification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Digital transformation; Holistic model; Information asset management; Information assets"

To understand how users can be satisfied in the complex digital environment of SNSs, this study examines how motivations and emotions combine with each other to explain high satisfaction. Users’ motivations comprise four attributes, entertainment, information, social-psychological, and convenience. Emotions are divided into their two main categories, that is positive and negative emotions. We draw on complexity and configuration theories, present a conceptual model along with propositions and perform a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Through an empirically study with 582 SNSs users, we present eight combinations (configurations) of motivations and emotions that lead to high satisfaction, which highlight the role of high convenience, followed by entertainment and information motivations in being satisfied with SNSs. High satisfaction can be achieved both when positive and negative emotions are high and low, depending on how they combine users’ motivations. None of the factors are indispensable to explain high satisfaction on their own, instead they are insufficient but necessary parts of the causal combinations that explain high satisfaction. This study contributes in SNSs literature by extending current knowledge on how motivations and emotions combine to increase satisfaction, and by identifying specific patterns of users for whom these factors are important and influence greatly their satisfaction. © 2020 The Authors","Emotions; FsQCA; Motivation; SNS; Social media; Social networking sites; User satisfaction"

This interest has renewed the debate regarding the use of AI for the automation of work, which has been described as Intelligent Automation (IA). A new dimension to this debate is whether COVID-19 will be the catalyst for higher IA adoption levels. This article reviews arguments in favour of COVID-19 increasing the level of IA adoption and possible counter-arguments. Key arguments in favour of increased IA adoption include consumer preferences changing to favour IA, increasing familiarity of IA technologies, and increased business confidence in IA. Counter-arguments include big data availability and reliability limitations, many tasks still favouring human skills over IA, the narrow capabilities of IA technologies, and a high availability of human workers.

However, children of today are not equally equipped for their technology rich future: various kinds of digital divides still prevail in the society and affect the young generation and their digital futures. Schools and education of children should undergo an extensive digital transformation to be able to meet the needs of the young generation and their digitalized future. The COVID-19 pandemic has suddenly and abruptly forced schools and education indeed to engage in such a transformation. In this study we examine the digital transformation initiated by the COVID-19 pandemic in the basic education of the young generation, the variety of digital divides emerging and reinforced, and the possible barriers reported along the way. We argue that information management research should better acknowledge children, their digitalized everyday life and their basic education as significant areas of concern. We should understand them as well as allow them to shape the education we offer in the context of higher education, but we should also aim at influencing the basic education of the young generation – for the purpose of equipping them with important skills and competencies for their digital futures but also for the purpose of arousing their interest in this important field, maybe even as a career option. © 2020 The Authors","Children; COVID-19 pandemic; Digital transformation; Education; Parents; Teachers"

Organisations must cascade insights from analytics to frontlines for dynamic (re)bundling of service elements while serving customers. However, very little is known on how FLEs are empowered in analytics-driven services. This study addresses these research gaps, drawing on a systematic literature review and in-depth interviews (n = 30), followed by conceptualisation and validation of an empowerment scale through a pilot (n = 50) and the main study (n = 304). This research confirms empowerment as a second-order construct consisting of six dimensions namely, decision making, discretionary skills, information access, knowledge, tools and training. The predictive power of the scale is validated through PLSc and PLSpredict (k = 10) using a training sample (n = 274) and a holdout sample (n = 30). Theoretically, this work extends FLE empowerment to analytics-driven services. Practically, the study informs managers to complement their investments in technology with an internal orientation program to empower FLEs to effectively link with customers and seize opportunities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Analytics-driven services; Confirmatory composite analysis (CCA); Dynamic capabilities; Frontline employees; Information empowerment; PLS-SEM; Scale development"

One way to find novel ideas is to transfer uncommon features of products of other domains and integrate them into the product to be improved. However, before incorporating such targeted features into the product, they need to be evaluated against the customers’ acceptance in social media using sentiment aggregation tools. Despite the many studies in sentiment analysis, mapping the customers’ opinions towards both high-level and technical features of a product extracted from social media to their best corresponding component in that product is still a challenge. Furthermore, none of the existing approaches ascertains the sentiment value of a targeted feature by capturing its dependencies on other features. In this paper, to address these drawbacks, we propose the sentiment aggregation framework for targeted features (SA-TF). SA-TF determines the sentiment of a targeted feature by assisting product designers in the tasks of mapping the features discussed in the reviews to the right product components, sentiment aggregation and considering feature dependencies to determine their polarity. The superiority of the different phases of SA-TF is demonstrated with experiments and comparing it with an existing approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Decision recommendation; Feature's interaction; Ideation; New product development; Product tree; Sentiment aggregation"

There are numerous potential benefits in using these devices, especially among seniors. Yet, little is known about seniors’ adoption behavior. Through a mixed-methods approach, this study investigates the factors that impact seniors’ intention to use wearable devices. Results from an online survey and interviews showed that seniors’ perception of the complexity of working with these devices is a barrier to their adoption decisions. Looking more deeply into the role of complexity revealed that seniors’ concern about the complexity of reading and interpreting the output of wearable devices is the main deterring element. Furthermore, we explored the role of two important elements: seniors’ cognitive age, and the influence of their subjective well-being on their adoption behavior. Results demonstrated that cognitive age does not significantly impact use intention by itself; nonetheless, subjective well-being moderates its effect. This result revealed an interesting finding, which is that the influence of cognitive age on seniors’ use intention depends on seniors’ level of subjective well-being. When seniors’ subjective well-being is low, surprisingly, cognitive age increases seniors’ intention to use the device. These findings provide interesting implications for practice and future research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cognitive age; Complexity; Older adults; Smart wearable devices; Subjective well-being"

This process has three important issues, perceived risk for virtual stores as well as e-store design and psychological state for online shopping. This is because consumers are both system users and impulse buyers when shopping on e-stores. E-store design is based on the interaction of customers with e-stores and the expectation-confirmation model supports examination of this issue with a wide familiarity in IT use. Psychological state is emotional responses to the stimulus of products in e-stores and flow theory, with task skill and task challenge as precursors, is suitable for exploring this issue.

We show that SA of tweets has potential as a real-time barometer of public sentiment towards negotiating outcomes to inform government decision-making. Despite the increasing need for information on collective preferences regarding possible negotiating outcomes, negotiators have been slow to capitalise on BDA. Through SA on a corpus of 13,018,367 tweets on defined Brexit hashtags, we illustrate how SA can provide a platform for decision-makers engaged in international negotiations to grasp collective preferences. We show that BDA and SA can enhance decision-making and strategy in public policy and negotiation contexts of the magnitude of Brexit. Our findings indicate that the preferred or least preferred Brexit outcomes could have been inferred by the emotions expressed by Twitter users. We argue that BDA can be a mechanism to map the different options available to decision-makers and bring insights to and inform their decision-making.

To empirically test the proposed theoretical model, two survey studies were conducted using mobile apps requesting less sensitive information (n = 487) and more sensitive information (n = 559). The findings show that the perceived privacy risk negatively influences the perceived security of the mobile apps; the perceived effectiveness of a privacy policy positively influences user perceptions of mobile app security; and perceived privacy awareness moderates the effect of perceived privacy risk on the perceived security of mobile apps. The results also suggest that users have different privacy-security perceptions based on the information sensitivity of the mobile apps. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Communication privacy management (CPM); Mobile applications; Perceived privacy; Perceived security; Privacy policy"

Some existing studies have examined multiple dimensions of attraction including social, physical, and task attraction. However, the mechanism behind these three attraction dimensions and parasocial interaction in social shopping websites has not been well examined. This study adopts technology attraction theory and parasocial interaction theory to analyze how three types of technology attraction affect parasocial interaction, which consequently influences users’ social commerce intention. This study conducted a survey to analyze the proposed empirical model and analyzed data from 248 social shopping website users. The results indicate that social attraction and task attraction positively and directly affect the users’ parasocial interaction. In contrast, physical attraction indirectly influences users’ parasocial interaction via social attraction and task attraction, respectively. Parasocial interaction consequently influences users’ social commerce intention.

We assess the utility of such perspectives for studying digital inequality across prefectural cities in China. China is the world's largest ICT market in terms of the number of mobile devices in use, internet users, and broadband subscriptions, yet it has notable digital inequality within and between provinces, prefectural cities, and counties. In this study, we built a conceptual framework of digital divides for prefectural cities in China, examined spatial agglomeration using cluster analysis, and explored the leading correlates using a geographically-weighted regression (GWR) model. A large digital divide among the prefectural cities in China was revealed, with cities with a high administrative level having a relatively high digital development index(DDI) score. Prefectural cities with high DDI levels are mainly agglomerated in large metropolitan areas, such as Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the West Coast Economic Zone of the Taiwan Straits. Prefectural cities with low DDI levels are concentrated in the rural-mountainous regions in southwest China and poverty-stricken areas in central and western China. This study also found that the leading determinants of the digital divide are urban residential income, the secondary education gross enrollment ratio, rural residential income, and the working age population ratio, which indicates that socio-economic problems, rather than institution and innovation aspects, have to be solved for improving ICT use and outcomes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cluster; Digital divide; Impact factor; Prefectural cities; Spatial difference"

These two purposes, however, are not necessarily aligned and can engender a dilemma in which investing to achieve environmental sustainability may threaten business profitability to some extent. Thus, this research builds on the theoretical perspective of corporate ecological responsiveness and proposes three types of strategic drivers for green IT initiatives (economic, authority, and moral drivers). How various types of organizations may be motivated by these green IT initiative drivers will affect whether organizations can reconcile the objectives of environmental sustainability and business profitability. We further deduce findings from multiple case studies of eight organizations in China and Singapore. The findings illustrate that the characteristics of any given organization influence why various driving factors affect their green IT initiative decisions. Additionally, “doing good” and “doing well” are reconciled when organizations consider the short-term investment and long-term benefit, design appropriate strategy, and receive severe external pressure.

However, issues such as vaccine expiration and vaccine record fraud are still widespread in vaccine supply chains. Therefore, an effective management system for the supervision of vaccine supply chains is urgently required. As the next generation of core technology after the Internet, blockchain is designed to build trust mechanisms that can change current information management methods. Meanwhile, the development of machine learning technologies provides additional ways to analyze the data in information management systems. The main objective of this study is to develop a “vaccine blockchain” system based on blockchain and machine learning technologies. This vaccine blockchain system is designed to support vaccine traceability and smart contract functions, and can be used to address the problems of vaccine expiration and vaccine record fraud. Additionally, the use of machine learning models can provide valuable recommendations to immunization practitioners and recipients, allowing them to choose better immunization methods and vaccines. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Machine learning; Smart contract; Vaccine blockchain; Vaccine safety; Vaccine traceability"

One of the primary research questions answered is how blockchain can be utilized and applied to more accurately and transparently move goods through global supply chains. This company is at the forefront of developing such systems for use in industry, and a use case for egg distribution is detailed. The goal is to track products from farm to fork using blockchain and internet of things (IoT) enabled technologies. By creating traceable and transparent supply chains for food, consumers can attain the information they need to make informed choices about the food they buy and the companies they support. For stakeholders in the food supply chain, having traceability and transparency builds better relationships with their customers, increases efficiency, and reduces the risk and cost of food recalls, fraud, and product loss.

The food supply chain consists of many organizations having different interests and are often reluctant to share traceability information with each other. Blockchain has been advocated for improving traceability by providing trust. Yet, practice proved to be more stubborn. The goal of this paper is to identify boundary conditions for sharing assurance information to improve traceability. Four cases in the food supply chain have been investigated using a template analysis of 16 interviews. Eighteen boundary conditions categorized in business, regulation, quality and traceability categories have been identified. Some boundary conditions were found in all supply chains, whereas others were found to be supply chain specific. Standardization of traceability processes and interfaces, having a joint platform and independent governance were found to be key boundary conditions before blockchain can be used. Our findings imply that supply chain systems have first to be modified and organizational measures need to be taken to fulfill the boundary conditions, before blockchain can be used successfully. © 2019 The Authors","Blockchain technology; Business boundary conditions; Food supply chain; Traceability"

Frequently, textual data are encoded using vector models so the corpus is transformed in to a matrix of terms by documents; using this representation text clustering generates groups of similar objects on the basis of the presence/absence of the words in the documents. An alternative way to work on texts is to represent them as a network where nodes are entities connected by the presence and distribution of the words in the documents. In this work, after summarising the state of the art of text clustering we will present a new network approach to textual data.

Marketing ads possessing higher media richness generally have a positive effect on consumer decision-making, because rich media conveys more information, but mobile ads with richer media imply higher costs for both the marketer and the audience. The limitations of mobile devices have further highlighted the difficulty of mobile advertising and the issue of advertising costs. Selecting which media to deliver the appropriate information is the latest research trend, but few studies have applied the media richness theory to explain mobile ads’ effect on consumer behavior. This research thus explores the impact of media richness on consumer behavior at different AISAS (attention, interest, search, action, and share) stages, adopting experimental research, convenient sampling, and online questionnaire to collect data. From a total of 424 valid questionnaires, we find that media richness has a greater influence on the three early stages of AIS while having a lower impact on the later stages of AS. This research thus suggests that firms employing mobile ads should choose high richness media for those potential customers who are at the early stage of consumer behavior (AIS). For those who at the later stage (AS), it is good enough for marketers to utilize medium richness mobile ads. Following this suggestion, marketers can place mobile ads more precisely, thus improving the likelihood of a reduction in advertising costs for both the marketer and audience. As mobile ads with high media richness are more effective for high perceived risk products, firms need to use high richness media when they are promoting high perceived risk products even when potential consumers are at the later stage of AS. This research contributes to marketers dedicated to using a mobile advertisement strategy and helps refine both online consumer behavior and the media richness theory when including the context of mobile commerce. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","AISAS; Media richness; Mobile advertisement; Model; Product characteristics"

By surveying the attitudes towards and usage of social bots of leading European communication professionals (n = 2,247) from 49 European countries, we thirdly offer first indications how diverse European organizations in different European regions use social bots. Results indicate, that leading communication professionals in Central and Western Europe as well as Scandinavia perceive highly ethical challenges, while in Southern and Eastern Europe professionals are less skeptical regarding the usage of social bots. Only 11.5 percent (n = 257) declare their organization uses or are making plans to use social bots for strategic communication. They are used primarily for identifying and following social networks users. This refers specifically to the usage of digital traces for strategic communication purposes e.g., to identify topic area opinion leaders or social media influencers.

Based on the frameworks for philosophical, group and organizational wisdom, this paper identifies software development project team wisdom as a process for how team members best use the stock and flow of their knowledge through collective judgment, virtue-ethics, emotions/feelings, and effective decision-making during their project-related efforts. Adapting the efforts and functional similarities of both group and organizational wisdom practices, this effort determines that wisdom-related mechanisms (e.g., team diversity, networking with other teams and people, and their past experiences), joint epistemic actions (e.g., team reasoning, intuition, and aesthetic capacity), and team virtue and prudence become the different faces of the software development team wisdom process. We then propose how these different faces interrelate and how they also relate to project process effectiveness, such as team learning and speed-to-users, both of which have been rarely addressed empirically in the context of software development project teamwork. By examining 210 in-house software development project teams in a field study and using structural equation modeling analysis, our results empirically show the following: (a) software development wisdom-related mechanisms positively relate to software development team prudence and virtue and their joint epistemic actions, (b) software development team prudence and virtue are positively associated with software development team joint epistemic actions, and further (d) software development team joint epistemic actions are positively associated with software development project process effectiveness.

Following a comparative case study approach, we detail the role of temporal coordination through the study of two contrasting virtual teams—one with a 24-h lifespan, and one with a five-month lifespan—from two Industry-Academia collaboration projects. Our approach was longitudinal capturing virtual team activities from start to end of each project, and involved multiple data collection methods, including observations and interviews. The findings reveal that the virtual team lifespan influences the type of temporal coordination that emerges. In virtual teams with short lifespans, tight coordination with frequent communication can help to reduce the uncertainty characterizing the fuzzy front-end. On the other hand, in virtual teams with longer lifespans, loose coordination allows dispersed members to work simultaneously on different, complementary aspects of the task at hand. These findings extend scholarly understanding around how innovation activities are coordinated in technology-mediated environments, such as virtual teams. Finally, we discuss theoretical and managerial implications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Fuzzy front-end; Innovation; Temporal coordination; Virtual teams"

However, research has not sufficiently explained why these differences exist. Using the theory of reasoned action and social role theory, this paper investigates gender differences in people's decisions about information sharing in the context of social networking sites (SNSs). We developed a comparative model of the information-sharing decision process across genders and theoretically explained why these differences exist. Data was collected from an online survey taken by American SNS users. We found that privacy risks, social ties, and commitment were more important in the formation of attitudes toward information sharing for women than men. Gender significantly moderates the relationship between people's perceptions of information sharing and their intention to share information. This paper provides an enhanced understanding of gender differences in people's decisions about sharing information on SNSs. It advances gender differences research into the use of newly emerged information technology and provides researchers insightful views of the role that gender plays in the social media era. Being aware of the research findings, practitioners may better engage their targeted stakeholders on SNSs and collect more useful information for business purposes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Gender; Information-sharing decisions; Social networking sites; Social role theory"

While much previous research assumes that social media helps organizations to communicate with customers, less is known about whether customers embrace using social media to interact with organizations. It is important to understand the role of social media for business communication from the customers’ perspective, as this may significantly deviate from the organizations’ own communicative intentions. In this exploratory case study of the Moon Struck hotel in China, we investigate both how customers interpret the hotel's use of WeChat official account for business communication and how customers respond to messages received from Moon Struck's WeChat account. Adopting a symbolic interactionism perspective, we surprisingly find that WeChat personal accounts and Moon Struck's official account offer radically different meanings to followers. Specifically, WeChat personal account symbolizes a sociality-oriented meaning (e.g., relationship and image building), while Moon Struck's WeChat official account symbolizes information broadcasting-related meaning (e.g., selling, advertising, and branding). Both technological features and the distance of relationships among users contribute to the constructed symbolic meaning of technology, subsequently affecting users’ WeChat use patterns. The theoretical implications of this study are discussed and recommendations are made for future research and practice. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Business communication; Social media; Symbolic interactionism perspective; Symbolic meaning of technology"

To fill this gap, this study explored the differences and similarities between users and nonusers in the context of public cloud storage services of South Korea. Data (users = 210; nonusers = 187) were analyzed using structural equation modeling. For social influence, there was a significant difference between users and nonusers. For users, social influence was not a determinant for positive intention to use PCSS, whereas it was a determinant for nonusers. For other factors, there were no significant differences between the two groups, but each showed meaningful similarities: habit was the strongest predictor of the intention to use for both users and nonusers, whereas hedonic motivation was not an important concern for both; performance expectancy was a determinant for positive intention to use PCSS for both groups. Effort expectancy was a determinant for positive intention to use PCSS for users, whereas it was not a determinant for nonusers.

To test these effects empirically, we conducted an online survey with 775 participants. Results of our structural equation modeling show that prior privacy experience, computer anxiety, and perceived control have significant effects on privacy concerns. However, concerns for app permission requests have approximately twice as much predictive value than the other factors put together to explain mobile users’ overall information privacy concerns.

The traditional government information release strategies ignored the negative emotion evolution mechanism. Focusing on the information release policies from the perspectives of the government during public emergency events, by using cognitive big data analytics, our research applies deep learning method into news framing framework construction process, and tries to explore the influencing mechanism of government information release strategy on contagion-evolution of negative emotion. In particular, this paper first uses Word2Vec, cosine word vector similarity calculation and SO-PMI algorithms to build a public emergencies-oriented emotional lexicon; then, it proposes a emotion computing method based on dependency parsing, designs an emotion binary tree and dependency-based emotion calculation rules; and at last, through an experiment, it shows that the emotional lexicon proposed in this paper has a wider coverage and higher accuracy than the existing ones, and it also performs a emotion evolution analysis on an actual public event based on the emotional lexicon, using the emotion computing method proposed. And the empirical results show that the algorithm is feasible and effective. The experimental results showed that this model could effectively conduct fine-grained emotion computing, improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of sentiment classification. The final empirical analysis found that due to such defects as slow speed, non transparent content, poor penitence and weak department coordination, the existing government information release strategies had a significant negative impact on the contagion-evolution of anxiety and disgust emotion, could not regulate negative emotions effectively. These research results will provide theoretical implications and technical supports for the social governance.

Studies are being conducted worldwide to leverage the benefits provided by BT in improving the performance of the supply chains. The literature reveals BT to offer various benefits leading to improvements in the sustainable performance of the agriculture supply chains (ASC). It is expected that BT will bring a paradigm shift in the way the transactions are carried in the ASC by reducing the high number of intermediaries, delayed payments and high transaction lead times. India, a developing economy, caters to the food security needs of an ever-growing population and faces many challenges affecting ASC sustainability. It is therefore essential to adopt BT in the ASC to leverage the various benefits. In this study, we identify and establish the relationships between the enablers of BT adoption in ASC. Thirteen enablers were identified from the literature and validated by the experts before applying a combined Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methodology to envision the complex causal relationships between the identified BT enablers. The findings from the study suggest that, among the identified enablers, traceability was the most significant reason for BT implementation in ASC followed by auditability, immutability, and provenance. The findings of the study will help the practitioners to design the strategies for BT implementation in agriculture, creating a real-time data-driven ASC. The results will also help the policymakers in developing policies for faster implementation of BT ensuring food safety and sustainable ASCs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture supply chain; Blockchain technology; DEMATEL; ISM; Sustainability; Traceability; Transparency"

Our study provides an evolutionary view on how patients’ attaining satisfaction of their basic needs through using mHealth apps leads to their emotional bonding with the mHealth apps and consequently contributes to their overall well-being. We surveyed 113 patients who used an mHealth app for hospitalization and discharge advice and education. We found that (a) patients’ emotional bonding with the apps mediated the impacts of autonomy and relatedness needs satisfaction on their well-being in terms of enhanced IT-enabled self-esteem and reduced post-surgery physical symptoms; and (b) autonomy need satisfaction positively and negatively moderated the impacts of competence and relatedness needs satisfaction, respectively, on patients’ emotional bonding with mHealth apps.

New technologies can potentially help disseminate corporate financial information, reducing such asymmetries. In this paper we analyse firms’ dissemination decisions using Twitter, developing a comprehensive measure of the amount of financial information that a company makes available to investors (iDisc) from a big data of firms’ tweets (1,197,208 tweets). Using a sample of 4131 firm-year observations for 791 non-financial firms listed on the US NASDAQ stock exchange over the period 2009–2015, we find evidence that iDisc significantly reduces the cost of equity. These results are pronounced for less visible firms which are relatively small in size, have a low analyst following and a small number of investors. Highly visible firms are less likely to benefit from iDisc in influencing their cost of equity as other communication channels may have widely disseminated their financial information.

In prediction of disease risks, physicians’ clinical cognitive diagnosis data can be used for early prevention of diseases and, therefore, to reduce medical cost, to improve accessibility of medical services and to lower medical risk. However, researches involved no physicians’ cognition of patients’ conditions in intelligent inquiry under e-health business mode, offered no diagnosis big data, neglected the values of the fused text information generated by joint activities of online and offline medical data, and failed to thoroughly analyze the phenomenon of redundancy-complementarity dispersion caused by high-order information shortage from the online inquiry data-driven perspective. Besides, the risk prediction simply based on offline clinical cognitive diagnosis data undoubtedly reduces prediction precision. Importantly, relevant researches rarely considered temporal relationships of different medical events, did not conduct detailed analysis on practical problems of pattern explosion, did not offer a thought of intelligent portrayal map, and did not conduct relevant risk prediction based on the sub-maps obtained from the map. In consequence, the paper presents a disease risk prediction method with the model for redundancy-complementarity dispersion-based feature selection from physicians’ online cognitive diagnosis big data to realize features selection from the cognitive diagnosis big data of online intelligent inquiry; the obtained features were ranked intelligently for subsequent high-dimensional information shortage compensation; the compensated key feature information of the cognitive diagnosis big data was fused with offline electronic medical record (EMR) to form the virtual electronic medical record (VEMR). The formed VEMR was combined with the method of the sequential feature map for modelling, and a sequential feature map-based model for disease risk prediction was presented to obtain online users’ medical conditions. A neighborhood-based collaborative prediction model was presented for prediction of an online intelligent medical inquiry user's possible diseases in the future and to intelligently rank the risk probabilities of the diseases. In the experiments, the online intelligent medical inquiry users’ VEMRs were used as the foundation of the simulation experiments to predict disease risks in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OCPD) population and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) population. The experiments demonstrated that the presented method showed relatively good metric performances in the VEMR and improved disease risk prediction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cognitive diagnosis big data; Disease risk prediction; Online intelligent inquiry; Redundancy and complementarity dispersion; Sequential feature map"

In the event of violations, a social media brand or organization renders an apology – a form of social account – to alleviate users’ concerns and maintain user membership and engagement with the platform. To explore the link between apology offered by a social media brand or organization and the users’ trust dynamics in the brand's services, we study how organizational integrity can contribute to reducing individuals’ privacy concerns whiles increasing or repairing their trust. Drawing on organizational behavioral integrity literature, our proposed research model suggests that the persuasiveness of an apology following a data breach affects users’ trust or spillover trust through their perceptions of the degree of alignment between the words in the apology and the actions of the violating entity. Based on a survey of Facebook users, our findings show that persuasiveness of an apology has a significant impact on users’ perceptions of the alignment between the social media brand's (i.e. Facebook) words and subsequent actions. These perceptions impact social media brand trust (i.e. users’ trust in Facebook and allied services such as Instagram). We also find that, post data breach incidence, while integrity of the social media organization partially mediates the relationship between persuasive apology and users’ trust, it fully mediates the relationship between the persuasive apology and the privacy concerns expressed by the users. However, users’ privacy concerns do not contribute much to the repair of trust needed to maintain their membership. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Apology; Behavioral integrity; Facebook; Privacy concerns; Social media; Trust"

Different kinds of information sources have improved the consumers’ online shopping performance and make it possible to realize the business intelligence. Grip force and eye-tracking sensors are applied to consumers' online reviews search behavior by relating them to the research approaches in IoT. To begin with, public cognition of human contact degrees of recycled water reuses with grip force test was measured. According to the human contact degrees, 9 recycled water reuses presented by the experiment are classified into 4 categories. Based on the conclusion drawn from grip force test, purified recycled water and fresh vegetable irrigated with recycled water are regarded as the drinking for high-level human contact degree and the irrigation of food crops for low-level human contact degree respectively. Several pictures are designed for eye-tracking test by simulating an on-line shopping web page on Taobao (the most popular online shopping platform in China). By comparing the fixation time participants spent on the areas of interest (AOIs), we justify that consumers' online reviews search behavior is substantially affected by human contact degrees of recycled products. It was found that consumers rely on safety perception reviews when buying high contact goods. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Eye-tracking sensor; Grip force sensor; Internet of Things (IoT); Online reviews search behavior; Recycled products"
"The role of big data analytics capabilities (BDAC) in understanding the challenges of service information and operations management in the sharing economy: Evidence of peer effects in libraries","2020","International Journal of Information Management","10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.10.008","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075359716&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijinfomgt.2019.10.008&partnerID=40&md5=c7a95c07a011752464f1c117e75a5501","Information and operations management in libraries presents a unique opportunity to provide insights for the sharing economy. Libraries correspond to a special type of sharing goods, named common-pool resources. Such resources have two characteristics: they are non-exclusive, but rival to each other. Service operations in libraries involve thousands of operations every year, making them a perfect context for the use of big data analytics capabilities (BDAC) to provide real-world evidence on the potential existing challenges in the sharing economy. Employing a novel dataset related to 723,798 library transactions, made by 16,232 individual users during a 10-year period (2006–2015), we estimate peer effects among users via regression analysis, considering the number of books each user borrows. Our main results suggest that a rise in the number of loans among a user's peer group correlates with her own loans, an evidence of positive peer effects. However, a closer look at the data suggests a high degree of heterogeneity, in terms of behavioral patterns. First, we suggest that peer effects do not occur in the case of users who are not subject to monetary fines. Second, peer effects vary according to users’ category (student or non-student), and area of study (management, accounting, economics, and other courses). Third, there is evidence of different magnitudes of peer effects according to time in school, which suggests the existence of learning effects in a library setting. The results reported in this paper highlight the important role of big data analytics capabilities to uncover new challenges of the sharing economy, having important implications, both in theoretical and practical terms. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Big data analytics capabilities; Information and operations management; Libraries; Peer effects; Sharing economy"

As a result, people are growingly seeing the outside world, in a sense, through the lens of algorithms. Despite the importance of algorithmic experience (AX), few studies had been devoted to investigating the nature and processes through which users perceive and actualize the potential for algorithm affordance. This study proposes the Algorithm Acceptance Model to conceptualize the notion of AX as part of the analytic framework for human-algorithm interaction. It then tests how AX shapes the satisfaction with and acceptance of algorithm services. The results show that AX is inherently related to human understanding of fairness, transparency, and other conventional components of user-experience, indicating the heuristic roles of transparency and fairness regarding their underlying relations of user experience and trust. AX can influence the user perception of algorithmic systems in the context of algorithm ecology, offering useful insights into the design of human-centered algorithm systems.

In the context of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), this is particularly valid as knowledge creation and dissemination direct their mission and vision. Academics are one of the pillars of HEIs, where knowledge is created and shared. Nonetheless, as HEIs strive to promote academics’ knowledge sharing culture, the actual behaviour of academics might remain inhibited by numerous issues, namely the organizational. Prior research has been focused primarily on individual, technological and scarce aspects of organizational elements. Therefore, this study assesses the role of organizational climate operationalized by organizational leadership and trust in academics’ KS in HEIs. Partial Least Square (PLS) method where variance-based Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was applied in this study. Results from 257 surveyed academics indicate that organizational climate has an exceptionally strong influence on academics’ KS practices.

The research undertakes an in-depth case study based approach. It uses data triangulation, where multiple sources of evidence (interviews, conference audio recordings and documents) are collected from the case organisation (a vendor) and its service ecosystem partners in the ICT sector. The partners included in the study are distributors, channel partners, competitors, and customers. B2B alliances are driven by the motivations to maximise strategic value and minimise transaction cost. Thus, using the ecosystem lens, we find that actors’ capabilities (resources and perceived value), vendor's approach to achieving strategic benefit and the channel governance mechanism enable value co-creation. However, using the transaction cost theory lens, we report that actors’ opportunistic behaviour, technological disruptions and new business model challenges lead to value co-destruction (in the form of termination of relationship, conflict and business liquidation). Alliance partners need to evaluate the strategic benefits of collaboration, knowledge sharing, learning, trust building, market expansion and technology sharing, considering partners’ self-serving behaviour driven by transaction cost economies. All ecosystem actors are seeking to develop capabilities, exhibit knowledge differentiators, demonstrate technology leadership, reduce uncertainty and respond to new business model challenges thus causing value co-destruction. Thus, this research is more encompassing because it explores factors that lead to both value co-creation and co-destruction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Alliances; Data triangulation; Opportunism; Service ecosystem; Thematic analysis; Value co-creation; Value co-destruction"

It compares users’ emotions before and after the launch of three new products in the market—a pizza, a car and a smart phone—for possible inputs for NPD. The user-generated content offers an alternative to conventional survey data and is cross-cultural in nature, relatively inexpensive and provides real-time information about user behaviour. A total of 302,632 tweets that mentioned the three new products before and after the launch were collected and analysed. Sentiment analysis of the tweets from two time periods was conducted and compared. The users’ responses to the pre- and post-launch of three products vary. The dissatisfaction with the new products represented by negative emotions aligns with the market performance. In the pre-launch period, trust and joy were more common for pizza, joy was more common for the car, and trust was more common for the phone. In the post-launch period, anger and disgust were more common for pizza, joy and trust were more common for the car, and joy was more common for only one aspect of the phone. Further analysis showed that for the car and the phone, firms need to focus on user attitudes towards product attributes, whereas for pizza, firms should concentrate on physiological changes, i.e., changes in product attributes, service and promotional sides. By using the proposed alternative approach, businesses can obtain real-time feedback about the expectations and experiences of the new products. The NPD process can be adjusted accordingly. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Emotion classification; New product design; Social media; User-generated content"

Yet, high rates of financial exclusion inhibit rural Indians from participating in these supply networks. We review the literature on financial inclusion, adoption, and blockchain in India, and posit that to resolve financial exclusion, the four challenges of geographical access, high cost, inappropriate banking products, and financial illiteracy need to be overcome. Next, we argue that blockchain technologies hold the potential to overcome most of these challenges. However, for blockchain technologies to become the cornerstone of financial inclusion initiatives, an understanding of technology adoption in India is needed. To guide the development of such understanding, we develop a research agenda on the antecedents of adoption, adoption patterns, and outcomes of adoption. Answering these research questions will lead to a nuanced understanding of adoption of blockchain-based technologies in rural India. The practical contribution of this paper is the discussion of how blockchain can alleviate the issue of financial exclusion in rural India, thereby providing a basis for a solution that could connect rural Indians to global supply chain networks. The theoretical contribution lies in the identification of knowledge gaps that should be answered to achieve financial inclusion of rural Indians. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adoption; Blockchain; Financial inclusion; India; Research opportunities"

Due to their ubiquitous nature, social media platforms are expected to offer a unique opportunity for crisis communication. In this study, about 52.5 million tweets related to hurricane Sandy posted by 13.75 million users are analyzed to assess the effectiveness of social media communication during disasters and identify the contributing factors leading to effective crisis communication strategies. Efficiency of a social media user is defined as the ratio of attention gained over the number of tweets posted. A model is developed to identify more efficient users based on several relevant features. Results indicate that during a disaster event, only few social media users become highly efficient in gaining attention. In addition, efficiency does not depend on the frequency of tweeting activity only; instead it depends on the number of followers and friends, user category, bot score (controlled by a human or a machine), and activity patterns (predictability of activity frequency). Since the proposed efficiency metric is easy to evaluate, it can potentially detect effective social media users in real time to communicate information and awareness to vulnerable communities during a disaster. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Crisis communication; Disaster management; Evacuation; Hurricane Sandy; Hurricane warning; Social media; Twitter"

Importantly, while marketers and public relations experts have taken leading positions in promotion and advancement of SM, project managers are often tasked with delivering SM systems. In this study, a sample of 127 project managers were asked to evaluate and recommend modes of SM development for six diverse firms using a four-part taxonomy. The results show that firms of varying size can employ narrowly focused and low cost SM development modes to meet their business objectives, with well-resourced firms able to use experimental modes to deliver widespread and higher cost ‘listen and learn’ SM systems. Alternatively, in addition to achieving groundswell promotions and broader business marketing and sales influencing objectives, firms that engage in large scale SM developments can document and implement SM best practices and apply multi-organizational collaborations required for information exchange, customer feedback and experience sharing. These managerial perspectives expose the intrinsic connections between SM systems and information messaging and management within firms.

Some potential issues with the framework are then discussed, perhaps the most important of which is that version 7 is not backwards compatible with version 6, which can lead to undesirable results when two users of the framework (e.g. an employer and job applicant) interact with one using version 6 and the other using version 7. Other issues examined are the lack of universal certification criteria for objective assessment of skills (which affects the portability of the framework between users), the complexity of the framework in terms of skill/proficiency mapping, the representation of soft or transferable skills and the limited scope for automating skill management tasks. Some solutions to these issues are offered, including structuring the skill definitions to include mappings between different SFIA versions and creating mappings to recognised formal qualifications, industry certifications and job experience. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","ICT; SFIA; Technical skills; Transferable skills"

The links between blockchain technology, OM, and sustainability issues within SCM are analysed. This two-step research study includes a broad review of the main contributions in the literature that have focused on blockchain technology and OM in SCM. It covers the airport industry from the perspective of sustainable performance and data analysis by reading and processing financial statements, non-financial reports, and the website of one strategic airport infrastructure in southern Italy. The Italian airport infrastructure investigated successfully adopted the Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) platform. This is one of the main blockchain technology applications in the airport industry. It promotes cooperation between the main players in the aviation industry and the air traffic controllers (ATCs) to reduce fragmentation, inefficiency, and uncoordinated operations. It also allows information and data sharing, but it is still not possible to observe a high level of sustainable performance. Although the adoption of blockchain technology presents numerous benefits, especially in improving OM, these new technological solutions do not guarantee the achievement of the best performance in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability issues. Managers and policy makers need to work together to create a real forum within their collaborative network in which there is a common culture and mutual trust. This article adds an interesting reading of blockchain technology to the existing research with concerns about OM and sustainability issues within the airport setting in Italy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Airport industry; Blockchain technology; Non-financial reports; Operations management; Supply chain management; Sustainable performance"

Structural equation modeling based analysis of data collected from 184 company CEOs in Finland revealed that CEOs’ information literacy has a positive impact on the development of exploratory and exploitative innovations in SMEs. Additionally, opportunity recognition mediates the relationship between information literacy and innovation. Overall, the influence of information literacy is slightly stronger on exploitation than exploration. Nevertheless, the mutual positive effect suggests that information literacy enhances innovation ambidexterity in organizations.

Nevertheless, even in the age of social commerce, and the communication affordances of social networking sites, consumers are not always informed regarding such benefits. As such, we examine how the characteristics of social commerce and organic foods can work in tandem to influence organic products purchase intentions. We develop a model based on the theory of consumption values and test it empirically. The results show that interactivity, recommendations, and feedback are important social commerce characteristics (affordances), while food safety and eco-friendliness are key organic food characteristics. Such social commerce and organic food characteristics interact and serve as inputs for functional value and emotional value assessments, which in turn, drive purchase intentions of organic foods via social commerce. The findings also show that functional value is more instrumental in this process; and that there is also a significant difference between males and females in the formation of purchase intention.

To address this gap, we draw on DeLone and McLean's (2003) updated information systems (IS) success model in order to develop an m-government success model that theorizes service quality as comprising online and offline service quality and further uses perceived value to measure net benefits. The results of a survey of 286 m-government users in China indicate that information quality and online service quality, but not system quality, are positively associated with citizen satisfaction, which in turn is positively associated with perceived value. The results also show that the relationship between online service quality and citizen satisfaction is positively moderated by offline service quality, while citizen satisfaction partially mediates the relationships between information quality/online service quality (but not system quality) and perceived value. This study extends the updated IS success model by differentiating between online and offline service quality, as well as by introducing the notion of perceived value.

However, because of pro-innovation bias, scholars have a focus on the adoption of technology and very little attention has been given to the resistance of innovation, especially in the m-wallet context. This study addressed this absence by examining the inhibitors of m-wallet innovation adoption through the lens of innovation resistance theory (IRT). By applying a sophisticated two-staged structural equation modeling-artificial neural network (SEM-ANN) approach, we successfully extended the IRT by integrating socio-demographics and perceived novelty. The study has unveiled the noncompensatory and nonlinear relationships between the predictors and m-wallet resistance. Significant predictors from SEM analysis were taken as the ANN model's input neurons. According to the normalized importance obtained from the multilayer perceptrons of the feed-forward-back-propagation ANN algorithm, we found significant effects of education, income, usage barrier, risk barrier, value barrier, tradition barrier, and perceived novelty on m-wallet innovation resistance. The ANN model can predict m-wallet innovation resistance with an accuracy of 76.4 %. We also discussed several new and useful theoretical and practical implications for reducing m-wallet innovation resistance among consumers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial neural network; Innovation resistance theory; Mobile wallet resistance; Perceived novelty; Socio-demographics"

Results from a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) of 63 industrial service SMEs show that these firms attain high service innovation performance with three different configurations under conditions of high uncertainty. Two configurations highlight the importance of IT exploration capabilities (combined with the absence of innovation and networking capabilities in one configuration and with the absence of networking capabilities and IT capabilities for exploitation in another), whereas another configuration accentuates the importance of IT exploitation capabilities (combined with the presence of innovation and networking capabilities). Our study contributes to the literature in multiple ways. For instance, due to the equifinal properties of the configurational approach, our results suggest that SMEs can attain high innovation performance through both sequential and simultaneous IT ambidexterity, thus providing a starting point for reconciling competing views of IT ambidexterity.

New technologies help solve social problems such as transportation and education, while research brings benefits such as curing diseases and improving food production. Despite the impacts caused by science and society on each other, this relationship is rarely studied and they are often seen as different universes. Previous literature focuses only on a single domain, detecting social demands or research fronts for example, without ever crossing the results for new insights. In this work, we create a system that is able to assess the relationship between social and scholar data using the topics discussed in social networks and research topics. We use the articles as science sensors and humans as social sensors via social networks. Topic modeling algorithms are used to extract and label social subjects and research themes and then topic correlation metrics are used to create links between them if they have a significant relationship. The proposed system is based on topic modeling, labeling and correlation from heterogeneous sources, so it can be used in a variety of scenarios. We make an evaluation of the approach using a large-scale Twitter corpus combined with a PubMed article corpus. In both of them, we work with data of the Zika epidemic in the world, as this scenario provides topics and discussions on both domains. Our work was capable of discovering links between various topics of different domains, which suggests that some of the relationships can be automatically inferred by the sensors.

Current knowledge about competencies required in Industry 4.0 is scarce. The goal of this paper is to develop a profile of Industry 4.0 job advertisements, using text mining on publicly available job advertisements, which are often used as a channel for collecting relevant information about the required knowledge and skills in rapid-changing industries. We searched website, which publishes job advertisements, related to Industry 4.0, and performed text mining analysis on the data collected from those job advertisements. Analysis of the job advertisements revealed that most of them were for full time entry; associate and mid-senior level management positions and mainly came from the United States and Germany. Text mining analysis resulted in two groups of job profiles. The first group of job profiles was focused solely on the knowledge related to Industry 4.0: cyberphysical systems and the Internet of things for robotized production; and smart production design and production control. The second group of job profiles was focused on more general knowledge areas, which are adapted to Industry 4.0: supply change management, customer satisfaction, and enterprise software. Topic mining was conducted on the extracted phrases generating various multidisciplinary job profiles.

Scant attention, however, has been paid to whether and how employees’ IT satisfaction plays a role in generating job-related attitudinal changes among employees. Drawing upon satisfaction spillover theory, we developed and empirically tested a model to examine the relationship between individual satisfaction with workplace IT and job satisfaction. Specifically, we introduced two elements of user-task-technology fit—namely, job fit and professional fit—to examine the transition in employees’ satisfaction from the technological domain to overall satisfaction with work. We found that job fit not only mediated but also strengthened the effect of workplace IT satisfaction on job satisfaction, whereas professional fit did not play a moderating role in the relationship between workplace IT satisfaction and job satisfaction. The findings suggest that practitioners should emphasize workplace IT as a crucial ingredient of the work context and improve employee experiences with using IT. More importantly, the fit of IT with employees’ job and professional requirements is critical for this transition in satisfaction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","IT satisfaction; Job fit; Job satisfaction; Professional fit; Satisfaction spillover"

We investigate how consumers' perceived value is associated with their intention to use freemium services and to purchase premium content. We employ data gathered through an online survey (N=869) among players of freemium/free-to-play games. Firstly, we find support for the “Demand Through Inconvenience” -hypothesis proposed in this study, indicating that the higher the enjoyment of the freemium service, the lower the intentions to purchase premium content but higher intention to use the service overall. Secondly, social value is found to positively affect freemium use and premium purchases. Thirdly, the quality of the freemium service does not seem to be associated with premium purchases although it has a positive association with freemium use. Fourthly, the economic value of freemium services is positively associated with freemium service use and via increased use also has a positive effect on premium purchases. The findings of the present study highlight the peculiarity of the freemium business model: increasing perceived value of the freemium service (i.e. enjoyment) may both add to and retract from future profitability via increased retention on one hand, reduced monetization on the other. © 2019 The Authors","Business model; Freemium; PERVAL; Video games; Virtual goods"

This is because the five ‘Vs’ for generated research data; its Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity and its Value must be constantly considered. Invariably, a combination of data V's for any given research endeavour determine how best to manage it appropriately addressing archiving, compliance, security, privacy, sharing, reuse and so forth. As such, institutions are faced with defining, shaping and refining strategies and practicies to ensure there are consistent and adequate research data management polices and guidelines in place for their researchers. FAIR data principles are very important for embracing open data opportunities, but more broadly, research data management practices need to be established in a comprehensive way. Additionally, new ICT options have rapidly become available where institutions can make considered choices on whether to continue to use ‘on prem’, private Cloud or public Cloud infrastructure. If a hybrid approach is adopted, then the potential impact on existing institutional research data management strategies must be continually assessed and revised accordingly. Getting the balance right between developing a relevant institutional policy on the one hand yet also dynamically catering for the eclectic research data management and analytics needs of researchers and their evolving interactions with external collaborators on the other, must be continually navigated. In this manuscript, an exemplar-driven research data management and analytics conceptual framework is introduced. A key feature of this framework is that it is couched in two dimensions. On one axis is the ‘standard’ linear approach of developing the research data management policy, guidelines, procedures, audit and risk assessment and an options matrix. Importantly, a second axis comprising a researcher-driven focus is introduced where exemplar research activities are used to define ‘classes’ of research data management and analysis requirements. This exemplar-driven dimension enables an ongoing system-wide comparative review to occur in parallel that can continually inform policy and guidelines refinement. © 2019 The Author","Analytics; Exemplars; Hybrid Cloud; Policy and guidelines; Research data management; Researcher-driven"

Compact robotic automated parking system will facilitate the informatization and modernization of urban development and environmental protection. Compact robotic automated parking (CRAP) system is a new system with higher storage utilization and rapid response to store and handle cars. This system has double storage rings, instead of one storage ring in old compact automated parking (CAP) system for storing cars in each tier, and each tier is equipped with inner rotating ring and tier-captive automated guided vehicle for horizontal transport. The CRAP system has one elevator with vertical automated guided vehicle in the outer ring instead of the center part in the old CAP system for vertical transport.

Considering limited budget and time, hired users (seeds) are activated dynamically at different time intervals over a time horizon. This motivates to avoid the same seed activation in consecutive time intervals that leads to deteriorating the seeds’ efficiency. The aim of this paper is to maximize the total gain obtained in the process of maximizing the influence in a social network. Total gain is obtained by earning of influencing the customers and then deducting the cost incurred for influencing the users. Therefore, an improvised memetic algorithm is developed to find the seeds that are to be activated at different time intervals to maximize the gain.

By conducting an online survey (n = 491), this study reveals that inertia demonstrates triple effects on intention to use MP services: direct, bias, and moderating. The direct effect suggests that inertia directly decreases intention to use MP. The bias effect means that inertia leads to biased assessment of perceived value and perceived threat, thereby decreasing intention to use MP. The moderating effect denotes that inertia strengths the relationship between perceived controllability and intention to use MP.

Although mobile technologies have developed at great speed, little research has focused on the macroscopic viewpoint to understand the core knowledge of MobIS and its intellectual structure. To fill this research gap, articles related to MobIS from the ISI Web of Knowledge database and their cited articles were collected, and then citation analysis and document co-citation analysis were applied, including factor analysis and cluster analysis. This research identified 75 highly-cited articles and yielded 6 core categories of knowledge in mobile information systems: (1) Technology Acceptance; (2) Mobile Commerce; (3) Technology Innovation; (4) Use of Mobile Technology; (5) Measurement and Evaluation of Information Technology; and (6) Information System Success. The findings demonstrate that the MobIS field is still young and evolving. The core knowledge categories will be useful for scholars from different disciplines to effectively understand the core concepts and their relevance in MobIS in order to uncover possible research directions and entry-points in this rapidly expanding research area. Practitioners can also discover trend lines for future development, as well as identify extended themes for integration into the current MobIS field.

Focus of prior literature on knowledge diffusion has been on identifying factors that influence individuals’ behavioral intentions to seek and share knowledge. However, knowledge diffusion as an enigmatic, emergent and organizational-level process is more than the simple aggregation of individual attributes and needs to be further investigated. Accordingly, this study focuses on three distinct system-level factors, i.e., architectures of connections among individuals, distributions of knowledge roles and designs of selection mechanisms and analyses their effects on knowledge diffusion. To be more specific, we examine three distinct knowledge roles: seekers, contributors and brokers. We also distinguish between three types of selection mechanisms: objective selection mechanisms, feedback-based selection mechanisms and random selection mechanisms. By conducting agent-based simulations on four representative networks, i.e., regular networks, random networks, small-world networks and scale-free networks, our results show that the optimal knowledge diffusion performance can be achieved on scale-free networks where all agents implement objective mechanisms and show characteristics of brokers. Moreover, our results (a) highlight the significance of brokers, (b) illustrate the superiority of objective selection rules and (c) demonstrate that scale-free networks provide an optimal framework for knowledge diffusion. Furthermore, we also find the interdependent relevance of these three factors to knowledge diffusion and propose a qualitative explanation of these findings. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Communication policy; Knowledge diffusion; Knowledge roles; Network structure; Social networks"

We conceptualize an entirely different approach to analyzing the risk profiles of supplier performance under uncertainty by utilizing the data analytics capabilities in digital manufacturing. Digital manufacturing peculiarly challenge the supplier selection by the dynamic order allocations, and opens new opportunities to exploit the digital data to improve sourcing decisions. We develop a hybrid technique, combining simulation and machine learning and examine its applications to data-driven decision-making support in resilient supplier selection. We consider on-time delivery as an indicator for supplier reliability, and explore the conditions surrounding the formation of resilient supply performance profiles. We theorize the notions of risk profile of supplier performance and resilient supply chain performance. We show that the associations of the deviations from the resilient supply chain performance profile with the risk profiles of supplier performance can be efficiently deciphered by our approach. The results suggest that a combination of supervised machine learning and simulation, if utilized properly, improves the delivery reliability. Our approach can also be of value when analyzing the supplier base and uncovering the critical suppliers, or combinations of suppliers the disruption of which result in the adverse performance decreases. The results of this study advance our understanding about how and when machine learning and simulation can be combined to create digital supply chain twins, and through these twins improve resilience.

(1984) presented a survey-based model to classify product features based on their impact on customer satisfaction to aid designers in their product target setting. Approaches extending the Kano model rely on customer surveys as input data. In addition, existing studies classifying extracted product features from textual data (e.g. product reviews) rarely provide a clear separation in terms of Kano categories. Thus, the impact of identified product features on customer satisfaction remains unknown to product designers.

Thus, the present study developed and tested a series of hypotheses related to the antecedents of perceived value of MFSA use; it also examined how such use affects the development of customers’ overall relationships with banks. Our hypotheses were tested using two samples (N = 992; N = 524) comprising different types of MFSA end-users in one of the leading countries in digital banking, Finland. The results supported most of the hypotheses and revealed that self-congruence and new product novelty are the principal drivers of perceived MFSA value. In addition, the findings show that the perceived value of MFSAs yields strong positive effects on customers’ overall satisfaction and commitment to their bank.

Only recently have scholars undertaken empirical studies to investigate its antecedents and outcomes to better understand the impact of fatigue on social media users. To further this understanding, the present study has conducted a cross-sectional survey with 1552 users. The Stress-Strain-Outcome (SSO) theoretical framework is applied to examine if privacy concerns, self-disclosure, parental mediation strategies, and decrement in academic performance due to social media use correlate with social media fatigue. Two forms of fatigue are considered, namely, fatigue due to social networking site (SNS) and mobile instant messaging (MIM) use. The study results suggest that privacy concerns, self-disclosure, parental encouragement and worry significantly and positively correlate with SNS and MIM fatigue. Parental permission and parental monitoring are either not or lowly associated with fatigue. In addition to this, SNS and MIM fatigue positively correlated with the tendency to experience academic decrement due to social media use. The antecedents and consequences of social media fatigue were similar for SNS and MIM users. Moreover, students perceived their parents to be more open to their MIM use, and they had higher self-disclosure in MIM than in SNS. The study concludes with significant implications for practitioners, policy makers as well as service designers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Academic performance decrement; Mobile instant messaging; Parental mediation; Privacy concerns; Self-disclosure; Social media fatigue"

In studying physician searches, researchers often focus on expertise similarity matches and sentiment analyses of reviews. However, the quality is often ignored. To address patients’ information needs holistically, we propose a four-dimensional IT framework based on signaling theory. The model takes expertise knowledge, online reviews, profile descriptions (e.g., hospital reputation, number of patients, city) and service quality (e.g., response speed, interaction frequency, cost) as signals that distinguish high-quality physicians. It uses machine learning approaches to derive similarity matches and sentiment analysis. It also measures the relative importance of the signals by multi-criterion analysis and derives the physician rankings through the aggregated scores. Our study revealed that the proposed approach performs better compared with the other two recommend techniques. This research expands the boundary of signaling theory to healthcare management and enriches the literature on IT use and inter-organizational systems. The proposed IT model may improve patient care, alleviate the physician-patient relationship and reduce lawsuits against hospitals; it also has practical implications for healthcare management. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Machine learning; Multi-criterion analysis; Online healthcare communities; Physician identifying; Signaling theory; Topic modeling"

Poor service quality is a major reason why many users have discontinued using mHealth services. However, only a few studies have identified the critical quality components for continuance intention. The current study aims to identify the crucial quality dimensions for users’ continuance intention in an mHealth service called Onecare. This service provides various forms of support for the day-to-day health behavior monitoring of college students by utilizing daily behavior data. In this research, five major quality dimensions of mHealth services, namely, content quality, engagement, reliability, usability, and privacy, were derived from existing studies. The effect of each quality dimension on continuance intention was estimated by analyzing the survey responses of 191 Onecare service users. The quality dimension with the most considerable effect on continuance intention was determined to be engagement followed by content quality and reliability. By contrast, the effects of usability and privacy on continuance intention were insignificant. Furthermore, this study found that the optimal quality management strategy can change depending on the objective, i.e., to increase continuance intention or satisfaction. These results will help mHealth service managers allocate their limited resources to effectively and efficiently improve continuance intention. Future research is required to verify if the findings of this study are generalizable to any population because the sample used in this work was specific to Korean college students. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Continuance intention; mHealth; Mobile health service; Quality dimensions; Service quality"

Therefore, users may perceive the purpose of the same system differently, ranging from pure utility to pure play. However, in literature that addresses why people adopt and use information systems, the relationship between the users conception of the purpose of the system, and their experience and use of it has not yet been investigated. Therefore, in this study we investigate the interaction effects between users’ utility-fun conceptions of the system and the perceived enjoyment and usefulness from its use, on their post-adoption intentions (continued use, discontinued use, and contribution). We employ survey data collected among users (N = 562) of a gamified crowdsourcing application that represents a system affording both utility and leisure use potential. The results show that the more fun-oriented users conceive the system to be, the more enjoyment affects continued and discontinued use intentions, and the less ease of use affects the continued use intention. Therefore, users’ conceptions of the system prove to be an influential aspect of system use and should particularly be considered when designing modern multi-purposed systems such as gamified information systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Crowdsourcing; Dual information systems; Gamification; Post-adoption intentions; User conception"

In contrast, this research sheds light on how people's value systems influence their decision to adopt food delivery applications. Particularly, it proposes that people's moral obligation in meal preparation can change the mode of thinking that guides their adoption decision. Namely, moral obligation is assumed to restrict people from acting on their basic convenience orientation in meal preparation. Empirical results have supported this assumption by showing that people with a high moral obligation (or married people) are more reluctant to convert their basic convenience-seeking tendencies into actual adoption intention than those with a low moral obligation (or single people).

Moreover, in order to increase precision, we investigate sentiment polarity on a five-point scale. From a database containing 2,282,912 English tweets with the keyword ‘Starbucks’, we use a set of 2204 coded tweets both for analyzing brand authenticity and sentiment polarity. First, we examine the tweets qualitatively to gain insights about brand authenticity sentiments. Then we analyze the data quantitatively to establish a framework in which we predict both the brand authenticity dimensions and their sentiment polarity. Through three qualitative studies, we discuss several tweets from the dataset that can be classified under the quality commitment, heritage, uniqueness, and symbolism categories. Using latent semantic analysis (LSA), we extract the common words in each category. We verify the robustness of previous findings with an in-lab experiment.

Building on prior literature of browsing and motivation theory, this study views hedonic browsing and utilitarian browsing as two key drivers on impulse buying in mobile commerce. This study adopts partial least squares estimation to analyze the data obtained from an online questionnaire. Two main findings emerge. First, three situation factors (portability, visual appeal and interpersonal influence) differently affect hedonic browsing and utilitarian browsing. Second, hedonic browsing directly and positively influences consumers’ urge to buy impulsively, whereas utilitarian browsing indirectly influences consumers’ urge to buy impulsively through hedonic browsing.

Whilst most countries are able to respond to these technological changes by drawing on the resources available to them, organisations tend to find it more difficult to keep up. This paper thus attempts to analyse critically the influencing factors regarding e-government implementation and the roles of the key stakeholders in driving successful implementation within public sector organisations in developing countries. Based on the extant literature review and empirical studies, the researchers have developed a conceptual framework stemming from a unification of the concepts, factors, theories and models for e-government implementation. Qualitative analysis was adopted using a multiple case study strategy, and focusing on the three-tiers of government – Federal, Government Agency and Local levels. This conceptual framework has re-affirmed the external and internal influencing factors and the key stakeholder’ and their roles. The e-government stakeholders include the government (ministry/agency), technologically-advanced country, companies and users (employers/citizens). Authors further discussed that the stakeholders’ roles and tasks vary from ‘pre-implementation’ (initiation) to ‘during implementation’ (planning and implementation), and ‘post-implementation’ (monitoring and evaluation) phases. From the analysis and findings, authors have recommended that public organisations would need to strategise their relationships with stakeholders in order to achieve a collective interest for successful e-government implementation.

This study investigates the post-disruption stage, and its management. The unpredictability of disruption magnitude and nature suggests that the post-disruption management process may be as important, if not more so, than pre-determined pre-disruption strategies. An effective post-disruption management process would directly affect actual ability to recover from sudden and serious disruptions.

The present study, therefore, aims to bridge this gap, notably by helping understand the individual blockchain adoption behavior in the logistics and supply chain field in India and the USA. Drawing on the emerging literature on blockchain, supply chain and network theory, as well as on technology acceptance models (TAMs), we have developed a model based on a slightly-altered version of the classical unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). The model being developed was then estimated using the Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM).

A knowledge seeker's intention to reciprocate is motivated by perceived social benefits. An interpretation of intention to reciprocate cannot be fully addressed without investigating how knowledge seekers define the community support received in their knowledge-seeking process. This study suggests that perceived community support is the degree to which knowledge seekers perceive a supportive climate created by linking actors. An empirical study involving 471 knowledge seekers was conducted in an online professional community that seekers used to search for and acquire programming knowledge. The results indicated that knowledge seekers take perceived social benefits and perceived community support into account when forming an intention to reciprocate. In addition, perceived community support positively moderated the effect of knowledge-seeking effort on perceived social benefits.

We focus on a household with photovoltaics and energy storage system. We analyze the efficiency of Markov chains, stride predictors and also their combination into a hybrid predictor in modelling the evolution of electricity production and consumption. All these methods anticipate electric power based on previous values. The main goal is to determine the best method and its optimal configuration which can be integrated into a (possibly hardware-based) intelligent energy management system. The role of such a system is to adjust and synchronize through prediction the electricity consumption and production in order to increase self-consumption, reducing thus the pressure over the power grid.

The proposed model incorporates three acceptance generation stages (primary appraisal, secondary appraisal, and outcome stage) and six antecedents (social influence, hedonic motivation, anthropomorphism, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and emotion). Utilizing data collected from potential customers, the proposed AIDUA model is tested. Findings suggest that customers go through a three-step acceptance generation process in determining whether to accept the use of AI devices during their service interactions. Findings indicate that social influence and hedonic motivation are positively related to performance expectancy while anthropomorphism is positively related to effort expectancy.

Accordingly, firms with the aim of delivering a seamless customer experience strive to offer integrated solutions. This quite often relies on inter-organizational collaboration in the context of a value network In this context, customer-related knowledge is regarded as one of the primary sources in the provisioning process of integrated solutions. This, in turn, implies the importance of effective sharing of customer knowledge among actors of a value network. Customer knowledge transfer is difficult due to some recognizable challenges such as a lack of trust. Because of the added complexity of a value network, achieving a shared understanding among actors about customer knowledge transfer challenges in a value network setting (VN-CKTC) might be more difficult. A systematic and comprehensive overview of the VN-CKTC (in the form of a reference model) might support this by providing additional structure. Although scholars have long studied knowledge transfer challenges within business network settings, they are usually limited in scope and their resulting challenges differ widely. Therefore, they provide insufficient coverage of the possible challenges. A more comprehensive view is thus needed. Our research aims at designing and validating a reference model that provides a systematic and wider spectrum of possible VN-CKTC. To this end, a design science research approach is followed. In the design phase, by conducting a systematic literature review followed by a structured classification, a reference model of VN-CKTC is designed. In the evaluation phase, the validation of this designed artifact is evaluated in a value network setting by conducting multiple case studies. The results of this study give us both theoretically and context-speciﬁc descriptions of the significant relevant of these challenges. The proposed reference model provides a rich picture of VN-CKTC. Decision makers of value networks can use this reference model as a means to achieve a shared understanding about customer knowledge transfer challenges and to come to an agreement on these challenges. They can also apply it to be aware of which challenges to focus on, so they are provided with a much stronger basis to make better-informed decisions to address and mitigate these challenges. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Co-creation value network; Customer knowledge transfer challenges; Integrated solutions; Reference model"

In collaborative environments where users collect, share and build a knowledge base, trust is an important factor. If, for example, we as users trust UGC on the Web, this influences our interaction with this content. The aim of our research is to propose a model for the evaluation of trust in UGC. Based on the available research results, we define a model for measuring trust in collaborative environments. Our approach is based on three dimensions: stability, credibility and quality. These three concerns are combined to create a trusted translator. We use a real-world data set of the social annotation platform Genius to calculate the value of our trust in an annotation.

The depressive syndromes were captured by the modified Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. The Rank Theory of Depression was used a guiding framework. The data collection had focused on the 20–29 year olds, as justified by the literature. The study found a negative relationship between active Facebook use and non-directional social comparisons. The relationship was reversed in the case of passive usage. There is small but significant causal linkage between increased non-directional social comparisons and depressive symptoms among the users. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Depressive symptoms; Facebook usage; Mental health; Non-directional social comparison; Social media platforms"

This study diverged from the traditional adoption approach and drew on more innovative theories to predict the intentions of patients for adopting apps supported by clinics. More specifically, technology identity literature was explored to make this prediction and the study surveyed 292 patients who were seated in the waiting room of a local clinic. The results suggested that perceived mobile technology identity (MTI), perceived related IT experience, and perceived self-efficacy positively influences patients’ perceived intentions to adopt mHealth apps provided by clinics or hospitals. Furthermore, the results suggested that perceived related IT experience positively influences users perceived self-efficacy and perceived MTI. However, education was found to negatively influence patients’ perceived intentions to use mHealth apps. This study contributes to the growing literature on the use of these apps in trying to elevate the quality of patients’ lives. Moreover, there are implications for mHealth-app designers who are trying to make healthcare services accessible via smartphones. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","IT identity; mHealth apps; Mobile apps; Mobile technology identity (MTI); Self-efficacy"

The results from a sample of 280 followers show that the perceived influential power of digital influencers not only helps to generate engagement but also increases expected value and behavioral intention regarding the recommended brands. Moreover, brand engagement in self-concept raises brand expected value and both variables also affect the intention to purchase recommended brands.

A core assumption is that gamification should be able to increase the ability of a system or a service to satisfy intrinsic needs, and thereby the autotelicy of use as well as consequent change in beneficial behaviors. However, beyond these optimistic expectations, there is a dearth of empirical evidence on how different gamification features satisfy different dimensions intrinsic needs. Therefore, in this study we investigate the relationships between the user (N = 824) interactions with gamification features (immersion, achievement and social -related features) and intrinsic need satisfaction (autonomy, competence and relatedness needs) in Xiaomi and Huawei online gamified communities that represent two large technology product-related online brand communities in China through a survey-based study. The results indicate that immersion-related gamification features were only positively associated with autonomy need satisfaction. Achievement-related features were not only positively associated with all kinds of need satisfaction, but also the strongest predictor of both autonomy and competence need satisfaction. Social-related gamification features, were positively associated with autonomy, competence and relatedness need satisfaction. The results imply that gamification can have a substantially positive effect on intrinsic need satisfaction for services users. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Gamification; Intrinsic motivation; Motivational information system; Persuasive technology; Social networking"

Conventional means, such as questionnaire, survey and self-report with predefined questions and prompts, are used to collect information about users’ experience during various UX studies. However, such data is often limited and restricted by initial setups, and they won't easily allow designers to identify all critical elements such as user profile, context, related product features, etc. Meanwhile, with widely accessible social media, the volume and velocity of customer-generated data are fast-increasing. While it is generally acknowledged that such data contains important elements in understanding and analyzing UX, extracting them to assist product design remains a challenging issue. In this study, how UX data underlying product design can be isolated and restored from customer online reviews is examined. A faceted conceptual model is proposed to elucidate the crucial factors of UX, which serves as an operational mechanism connecting to product design. A methodology of establishing a UX knowledge base from customer online reviews is then proposed to support UX-centered design activities, which consists of three stages, i.e., UX discovery to extract UX data from a single review, UX data integration to group similar data and UX network formalization to build up the causal dependencies among UX groups. Using a case study on smart mobile phone reviews, examples of UX data discovered are demonstrated and both customers and designers concerned key product features and usage situations are exemplified.

The authors have borrowed a set of items arranged in eight dimensions from the literature on CC. A panel of selected practitioners (seven CEOs of CC companies) assisted in the design of the questionnaire, which was launched in June 2018. A sample of 127 questionnaires was used for exploratory factor analysis. A second sample of 301 users was used for confirmatory analysis using EQS 6.4 software. A scale of 21 items gathered under five dimensions is proposed. Accordingly, the perceived quality in CC is composed of five dimensions: three of them related to the interaction with the platform (“site organization”, “platform responsiveness and agility” and “legal protection and trustworthiness”), another related to the perceived quality of the peer service supplier (“peer service provider”) and the last one to assess the encounters with other consumers and with the person who provides the service (“social interaction”).

Correspondingly, this study extends existing knowledge by presenting an exploration of conditions for knowledge transfer success between ecosystem partners. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with thirty key stakeholders in order to acquire their perceptions of the presence of specific conditions within their ecosystem partnerships. Empirical data were analyzed using a fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis approach, resulting in the production of success recipes from multinational, small and medium-sized enterprise, and academic institution perspectives. Results indicate that combinations of knowledge, relationship, and organizational characteristics contribute to knowledge transfer success.

Production control in petrochemical industry involves complex circumstances and a high demand for timeliness; therefore, agile and smart controls are important components of intelligent manufacturing in the petrochemical industry. This paper proposes a framework and approaches for constructing a digital twin based on the petrochemical industrial IoT, machine learning and a practice loop for information exchange between the physical factory and a virtual digital twin model to realize production control optimization. Unlike traditional production control approaches, this novel approach integrates machine learning and real-time industrial big data to train and optimize digital twin models. It can support petrochemical and other process manufacturing industries to dynamically adapt to the changing environment, respond in a timely manner to changes in the market due to production optimization, and improve economic benefits. Accounting for environmental characteristics, this paper provides concrete solutions for machine learning difficulties in the petrochemical industry, e.g., high data dimensions, time lags and alignment between time series data, and high demand for immediacy. The approaches were evaluated by applying them in the production unit of a petrochemical factory, and a model was trained via industrial IoT data and used to realize intelligent production control based on real-time data.

To our knowledge, limited research is available for promoting understanding of whether intent induces different perceived moral affect (i.e., a perpetrator should have feelings of regret, sorrow, guilt, and shame) which explains the effect of perceived intensity of emotional distress on responsibility judgment. Further, research is sparse on enhancing understanding of whether the nature of a perpetrator's intent affects the moderating role of consideration of the consequences in the relationship between perceived moral affect and responsibility judgment. Increased understanding of the relationships among perceived moral affect, perceived intensity of emotional distress, consideration of the consequences, and responsibility judgment of an information security breach from the hackers’ perspective may shed light on their continued engagement in the act despite society's disapproval. Analyzes of the responses of 166 hackers recruited at two major hacker conferences reveal that perceived moral affect mediates the effect of perceived intensity of emotional distress on responsibility judgment only in an ill intention breach, and consideration of the consequences strengthens the relationship between perceived moral affect and responsibility judgment only in a good intention breach. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Consequences; Information security breach; Moral affect; Moral intensity; Responsibility judgment"

Two large social networks are analyzed, the first extracted from the Twitter discourse about a big telecommunication company, and the second obtained from three years of email communication of 200 managers working for a large multinational company. This work compares network robustness and the stability of centrality and interaction metrics, as well as the use of language, after removing spammers and the most and least connected nodes. The results show that spammers do not significantly alter the structure of the information-carrying network, for most of the social indicators. The authors additionally investigate the correlation between e-mail subject line and content by tracking language sentiment, emotionality, and complexity, addressing the cases where collecting email bodies is not permitted for privacy reasons. The findings extend the research about robustness and stability of social networks metrics, after the application of graph simplification strategies.

We also develop a theoretical framework with the relational view (RV) and theory of information-sharing (ToIS). Our results from path modelling indicate that RTIS is the key determinant of customer purchase behavior (CPB). Further, the results illustrate that customer orientation mediates the correlation between RTIS and CPB.

Our analysis shows that traditional click-stream models achieve 39% error rate in predicting learning performance (and 18% when we perform feature selection), while for fused multimodal the error drops up to 6%. Our work highlights the limitations of standalone click-stream models, and quantifies the expected benefits of using a variety of multimodal data coming from physiological sensing. Our findings help shape the future of learning technology research by pointing out the substantial benefits of physiological sensing. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Human learning; Machine learning; Multimodal data; Multimodal learning analytics; Skill acquisition; User-generated data"

We develop a model to investigate how cognitive factors and community technological factors influence users’ knowledge co-creation behavior, thereby influencing knowledge quality in the community. A survey of 382 knowledge contributors in a social Q&A community shows that knowledge self-efficacy, topic richness, personalized recommendation, and social interactivity have a positive impact on users’ knowledge sharing and integration behavior, which subsequently affect the community's knowledge quality. Moreover, users’ ratings moderate the influence of knowledge sharing on knowledge quality.

This paper aims to investigate the effects of social media's different excessive usage patterns on employee job performance and the corresponding underlying mechanism. Specifically, we propose three dimensions of excessive social media use at work (i.e., excessive social, hedonic, and cognitive). These dimensions are related to technology-work conflict and strain, which in turn decrease employee job performance. An empirical study of 305 social media users in organizations reveals that excessive social media use for socialization and entertainment can generate conflict between technology use and work demand, whereas excessive social media use for information-sharing reduces employees’ psychological strain. In addition, technology-work conflict and strain negatively influence job performance.

This study explores how the presence of the digital platform manifests itself in workers’ perceptions of their work in the context of ride-hailing. We draw on the literature on work relations and theorize how the dimensions of work relations manifest themselves in work done for a digital platform. We employ the Gioia method to analyze 39 interviews conducted with Uber and Lyft drivers, and we identify six key mechanisms of platform-enabled work, namely self-employment, time management, income, information control, pricing, and rating. Our results illustrate that from workers’ perspective, flexibility in work relationships is a key positive element of platform-enabled work. The stark power disparity between workers and the platform is, in turn, a major source of discontent among workers. As a result, we put forward two key dimensions of work relations in the context of platform-enabled work: digital temporality and algorithmic administrativity. The study furthers understanding of the implications from the platform economy and sharing economy on work relations. © 2019","Digital platform; Digitalization; Gig economy; Lyft; Platform economy; Ride-hailing; Sharing economy; Taxi; Uber; Work"

In the literature, IT or its applications play a paramount role in enabling firms to offer superior services and consequently deepen the relationships with their customers. Although already applied to augment customer experience and increase participation in practice, how blockchain applications interact with the LP context is still largely unknown in IS research. The objective of this research is to explore how blockchain, as an IT artifact on the rise, influences value creation in a LP context. Drawing on self-determination theory (SDT), this paper considers both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations in a LP context guided by SDT regulation: meeting the needs of Economy, Autonomy, Competence and Relatedness, and explores the effects of blockchain application on customers’ motivations, which influence value perception and participative behaviors. By using an exploratory case study of BubiChain in China, we collected data through semi-structured interviews and extracted from the raw data of BubiChain-based loyalty point exchange platform, including real-time, multi-brands, peer-to-peer, and secure, traceable and fraud-proof exchange. We found that these features of blockchain applications not only improve customers’ economic perceived value by meeting their extrinsic motivation but also enhance their social interaction and psychological self-fulfillment value perception by satisfying their intrinsic motivations, thus increasing customers’ experience and participative behaviors. We also synthesized the results and theorized the findings into 4 formal testable propositions, which would offer testable hypotheses for future empirical studies. This paper reveals an innovative breakthrough on SDT theory and LP research, and is an early attempt to analyze how the blockchain is applied to LPs. We endeavor to establish a theoretical overview of how the key features of blockchain-driven point exchange platform influence customers’ motivations, which affect value perception and consequently induce participative behaviors in a loyalty point context. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Block chain; Loyalty programs; Motivations; Perceived value; Self-determination theory"

From a large dataset of 2306 business decision-makers, the study identifies 205 lead users who are ahead of the majority in using business mobile services, while for the majority (n = 2101), business mobile services mainly supplement desktop and laptop computers. The authors test a binary logistic regression model in which individual technology readiness, sociodemographic variables, Internet use, and perceived importance of digital touchpoints predict lead userness in relation to business mobile services. The results show that job level is a highly significant predictor for lead userness in a work-related context, with senior management and entrepreneurs having the greatest likelihood for the use of business mobile services. Innovativeness and the perceived importance of mobile applications and social media also serve as positive predictors, while the perceived importance of websites and email result in a negative effect.

We test the effect of two enablers: perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment on perceived communication quality and social media continuance intention. We advance the understanding of the conceptualization of inhibitors from object-based, social-based, behavioral-based, and affective-based perspectives. We investigate the moderating effects of affective-based inhibitors (i.e., perceived social media distress and perceived social media anxiety) and the direct effects of object-based inhibitor (rapid change), social-based inhibitor (i.e., distorted reputation), and behavioral-based inhibitor (perceived complexity) on communication quality and continuance intention. To test the hypotheses, we collected data using an Online Crowdsourcing Markets (OCMs) technique. Using a sample of 268 Facebook users, our findings suggest perceived enjoyment is the main enabler, whereas perceived complexity is the main inhibitor of social media continuance intention. The findings also suggest that perceived social media anxiety moderates the relationships between (1) perceived complexity and perceived enjoyment, (2) perceived complexity and perceived usefulness, and (3) perceived complexity and perceived communication quality. We also find distorted reputation has a positive effect on perceived complexity but rapid change does not have a significant effect on perceived complexity. Perceived communication quality also significantly influences social media continuance intention. Our study confirms the dual factor model of technology usage and advances social media research by demonstrating that inhibitors are distinct from enablers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Dual factor model; Enablers; Inhibitors; Social media; Social networking sites"

In particular, technological advancements, such as the Internet of things, big data, sharing economy and crowdsourcing, have enabled new forms of business models that can effectively and abruptly make traditional business models obsolete. By disrupting or even diminishing companies’ revenue streams, environmental contingencies may present a significant threat to business continuity (BC). Evaluating the resilience of business models against these contingencies should therefore be a core area of BC. However, existing BC approaches tend to focus on the continuity of the resources and processes through which a particular business model is accomplished in practice but omit the business model itself. We argue that in order for BC approaches to become holistic and strategic, business models need to become a part of the BC considerations, entailing an expansion of the scope of BC from value preservation to value creation. We propose an approach of Strategic Business Continuity Management, which consists of two parts: (1)sustaining the continuity of the company business model (value preservation)and (2)evaluating and modifying the business model (value creation). We illustrate conceptually the value creation part with an example drawn from the sharing economy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Business continuity; Business models; Disaster recovery; Resilience; Sharing economy; Value creation"

Literature indicates social media platforms had also been used by the firms for building relationship with different stakeholders (i.e. customers, employees, investors and neighbouring communities). But there exists a gap in literature, whether social capital present on social media can be used for building corporate reputation (CR) in the society. Literature indicates corporate social responsibility (CSR) impacts CR. Therefore this study explores how CSR messages on social media impacts CR. For this study assumption was made that all the concerns and issues raised by Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the social responsibilities of the CEOs. The study tries to explore this gap by analysing the tweets posted by two group of CEOs, i.e. CEOs in top 200 fortune companies and top 100 social influencer CEOs. Top 100 social influencer CEOs on social media were identified from the Hootsuite.com. Social influencer CEOs are having tremendous amount of influence on Twitter. The statistically test performed on the two group of the CEOs depicts there is significant difference in the number of CSR messages posted by fortune CEOs and social influencer CEOs. Results reveals social influencer CEOs had posted 5.97 times more CSR messages on Twitter as compared to fortune CEOs, which in turn may had led to better CR, in terms of shares and likes by social capital present on Twitter. The study reveals may be social influencer CEOs through CSR messages are trying to engage stakeholders strategically on Twitter.

To reach such goals, this research work has developed a conceptual framework to represent the BPM implementation state. It is built along three axes: the BPM Cycle (Design, Enact, Maintain), the Field (Culture, Business, IT) and the Abstraction Level (Data, Jobs, Behaviour). An organization's overall BPM maturity can thus be evaluated by positioning its capabilities along the framework's axes.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are an information artifact used to guide a patient's care delivery over time. Despite evidence on the effectiveness of CPGs, they remain underutilized in certain contexts of medicine. One such example is colorectal cancer screening where disparities in screening rates and incidences of colorectal cancer are particularly prevalent between rural and urban populations. To address that issue, we need to better understand the information complexity factors that impact CPG implementation. This paper addresses the above shortcoming and uses a case study of colorectal cancer screening in remote and rural Northern Canada to develop a systems approach for modeling health information complexity. We describe a set of health information system components and interrelationships and a method for system mapping using the system components and interrelationships. We then provide exploratory system models from our case study and use them to characterize health information complexity according to interaction complexity and information behavior complexity. Our results highlight that information artifacts such as CPGs are not complex per se, but rather confounding factors is what causes information complexity. Our findings have implications for modeling information complexity and the design of policy and technological solutions to address health information complexity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Clinical practice guideline; Colorectal cancer; Continuity of care; Health care; Information complexity; Modeling"

Although product planning studies using social media data have used systematic methods for product planning, their methods have limitations, such as the difficulty of identifying latent product features due to the use of only term-level analysis and insufficient consideration of opportunity potential analysis of the identified features. Therefore, an opportunity mining approach is proposed in this study to identify product opportunities based on topic modeling and sentiment analysis of social media data. For a multifunctional product, this approach can identify latent product topics discussed by product customers in social media using topic modeling, thereby quantifying the importance of each product topic. Next, the satisfaction level of each product topic is evaluated using sentiment analysis. Finally, the opportunity value and improvement direction of each product topic from a customer-centered view are identified by an opportunity algorithm based on product topics’ importance and satisfaction. We expect that our approach for product planning will contribute to the systematic identification of product opportunities from large-scale customer-generated social media data and will be used as a real-time monitoring tool for changing customer needs analysis in rapidly evolving product environments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","New product development; Opportunity algorithm; Product opportunity; Sentiment analysis; Social media mining; Topic modeling"

The users were, then, surveyed using a field study of subjective measures based on the information systems (IS) success model. A priori sample segmentation used for facilitating the discovery of unobserved heterogeneity bias in the full sample. The analysis of the subset with 445 users who responded indicated that the path coefficient and explained variances (R2) of the IS model were higher in the segments compared to the full sample; and the influence of success factors on satisfaction and intention to use varied significantly among the segments.

Different data classification models were developed to foresee the financial crisis of an organization using their historical data. One important step towards the development of accurate financial crisis prediction (FCP) model involves the selection of appropriate variables (features) which are relevant for the problems at hand. This is termed as feature selection problem which helps to improve the classification performance. This paper proposes an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based financial crisis prediction (FCP) model which incorporates two phases: ACO based feature selection (ACO-FS) algorithm and ACO based data classification (ACO-DC) algorithm. The proposed ACO-FCP model is validated using a set of five benchmark dataset includes both qualitative and quantitative. For feature selection design, the developed ACO-FS method is compared with three existing feature selection algorithms namely genetic algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm. In addition, a comparison of classification results is also made between ACO-DC and state of art methods. Experimental analysis shows that the ACO-FCP ensemble model is superior and more robust than its counterparts. In consequence, this study strongly recommends that the proposed ACO-FCP model is highly competitive than traditional and other artificial intelligence techniques. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bankruptcy prediction; Credit risk; Feature selection; Machine learning; Metaheuristic"

This study used a research model based on the dual-factor concepts of “enablers” and “inhibitors” to explain users’ intentions to utilize telehealth. We extended the Technology Acceptance Model and Status Quo Bias with the technology anxiety concept to explain why patients accept or reject the use of telehealth from the perceived enablers and inhibitors of intentions. The experimental results demonstrated users’ ambiguous and indecisive intentions of adopting telehealth. It was also found that availability and perceived usefulness are the main factors that encourage individuals to adopt telehealth services. Technology anxiety and transition costs are the key factors in discouraging people from using telehealth. Technology anxiety could be overcome through the perceived usefulness to promote the adoption of telehealth. © 2019","Enabler; Inhibitor; Status Quo Bias; Technology Acceptance Model; Telehealth"

While communication is key to sharing information, sequencing the critical activities associated with care delivery is key to process efficiency and safety. The “communication” aspect has been often addressed by computer systems, but very limited attention has been paid to the “sequencing” aspect. Alongside, although real-time location systems (RTLS) are widely used for tracking purposes, they have not been used to develop analytical models for decision making, thus advancing the role and value of information technologies (IT). This paper proposes a data driven solution for developing prescriptive policies regarding the sequencing of care delivery activities in ambulatory care such that the goal of well-coordinated care may be achieved. Specifically, we propose a Markov Reward Process model to find the optimal care delivery sequence that minimizes patient waiting time using empirical data collected by Gen2IR/RFID technology in an outpatient clinic. We demonstrate improved sequencing of care delivery activities in comparison to status quo. The application of RFID in this study elevates the value of RTLS in healthcare from just tracking and identifying objects/persons to guiding and changing operational activities. Our method is generalizable to a variety of care coordination problems in different care delivery settings, and can be embedded in decision support systems for better operational sequencing of care delivery activities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Activity sequencing; Ambulatory care; Care coordination; Markov processes; Radio frequency identification; Real-time location systems; Value of IT"

Although cloud vendors promise high availability and reliability of their cloud services, cloud-related incidents involving outages and service disruptions remain a challenge. Understanding cloud incidents and the ability to predict them would be helpful in deciding how to manage and circumvent future incidents. In this study, we propose a hybrid model that employs machine learning and time series methods to forecast cloud incidents. We evaluate the proposed model using a sample of 2261 incidents collected from two cloud providers namely, Netflix and Hulu. Unique to this study is that our model relies solely on historical data that is independent of the underlying cloud infrastructure. Results suggest that the proposed hybrid model outperforms individual forecasting models: neural network, time series and random forest.

Previous studies have focused on one type of social media and thus overlook how the distinctive features of SNS and micro-blogging sites may affect underlying motivational mechanisms. To address this research gap, we draw from the self-regulation framework and propose a research model to explain how different appraisal factors (i.e., self-image and peer influence) affect continuance use through emotional responses (i.e., a sense of belonging and satisfaction). Furthermore, we argue that the effects of these appraisal and emotional factors are different across types of social media. We tested our research model by survey data collected from SNS and micro-blogging sites. The results confirm our hypotheses: First, self-image is a more significant factor in increasing SNS users’ sense of belonging and satisfaction, while peer influence has a greater effect on micro-blogging sites users’ sense of belonging and satisfaction. Second, the sense of belonging explains the greater variance of continuance intention in SNS as compared with satisfaction.

To validate the model, data were collected via survey from 224 responses from Malaysian local government department units. Using SEM-PLS, the study confirmed that data quality and data governance are two determinants of MDM adoption specific to the context of Malaysian local government, and four other determinants – complexity, top management support, technological competence, and citizen demand – are found to have significant effects on MDM adoption by local government. Surprisingly, three determinants – relative advantage, data security, and government policy – are found to have non-significant relationships to the adoption of MDM by local government.

We identify four types of extrinsic motivation including external motivation, introjected motivation, identified motivation, and integrated motivation; and we examine their influences on consumers’ intention to contribute social commerce information, which in turn leads to their subsequent behaviors and increases the perceived benefit of social commerce. We also consider the moderating effect of gender in the formulation of social commerce benefits. Based on longitudinal survey data from Amazon consumers, we find that 1) consumers’ external and identified motivation has a positive impact on intention to contribute social commerce information; 2) consumers’ intention is positively associated with their future behaviors, which in turn facilitate their perceptions of social commerce benefits; and 3) gender moderates the impact of behavior on social commerce benefits. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","e-commerce; Extrinsic motivation; Self-determination theory; Social commerce; Social commerce benefit"

Available literature highlights two kinds of assistive technologies; the first being Supportive Technologies that provide aid for already-declined functional abilities (such as hearing aids), and the second being Empowering Technologies that maintain functional abilities which have not yet declined (such as Xbox Kinect cognitive games). The difference in the nature between supportive and empowering technologies plays an important role in perceiving their benefits. For instance, while hearing aids as a supportive technology are perceived as useful through the improvement of hearing abilities, cognitive training games as an empowering technology have a long-term usefulness for cognitive abilities. This study conducts twenty-one qualitative interviews (range 65–87 years; mean = 71; SD = 3.81) and introduces perceived transfer effect. This effect allows the elderly to perceive the usefulness of playing cognitive training video games, which are designed to cultivate the cognitive abilities.

Our systematic literature review (SLR) reveals that EA is a broad concept that is interpreted and used in many different ways. This breadth can be explained by the various starting points taken, and by the content-dependent nature of many EA efforts. Unsurprisingly, the literature presents diverse views on value creation and locates the value of EA in a broad range of areas. Only half of the articles provide empirical evidence supporting the EA value claims. Frequently, values are assumed to be the result of EA efforts, but many alternative explanations are possible. Based on the SLR findings, we identify EA myths that are attributable to an overly simplistic conceptualization of EA. These myths have their basis in the claim that EA is an instrument that can solve almost any kind of enterprise problem. This fails to acknowledge that EA in itself often does not provide value, but is an instrument enabling the creation of value.

The research intention is to understand how social media is used to increase customer interactivity and spectator interest. We applied two integrated methods including one new scale to analyse and identify website interactivity and Facebook interactivity of the thirty-two football clubs involved in the 2014–2015 European Champions Cup. Six, seven-point items were used in the scale to measure the degree to which a person believes a website allows a free flow of information. A Pearson correlation of the Facebook pages was used to explore the strength of the relationship between two variables, analysing spectator interactivity. It was found that greater customer interactivity through social media can be deemed attractive and can increase spectatorship. The research also found that the level of website interactivity of a particular football club is not dependent upon their performance within the tournament. Those clubs who perform well, or are in a higher pool in the European Champions, do not appear to engage better with their spectators than the lower pools. The multiple regression results further confirmed these findings. The findings have important implications, which primarily suggest that social media is an effective form of marketing and can be useful in attracting spectators to a sports organization, if used appropriately. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Customer interactivity; Facebook; Football clubs; Social media; Spectator interest"

The listed factors in the proposed framework and the interrelationships between them highlight the multi-dimensional element of m-commerce adoption prevention. This observation proves criticality of analysing data as a collective entity rather than viewing the barriers in isolation. The findings also indicated ‘perceived risk’ being a key barrier that demonstrates how personal opinions of the concept of adoption can have a great significance on the outcome and whether other variables will come into effect. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Adoption; Barriers; ISM; M-commerce; SMEs; Wales"

The extracted knowledge can be used for predictive and/or descriptive purposes. DM has been successfully used in different subfields of eHealth such us cardiology, oncology and endocrinology. This paper deals with the use of DM predictive techniques in diabetes self-management (DSM).To the best of our knowledge, neither a systematic map nor a systematic review have yet been performed with a focus on the use of DM predictive techniques in DSM. Thus, the aim of this study is to classify and review primary studies investigating DM predictive techniques in DSM by summarizing and analyzing knowledge with respect to: year and source of publication, type of diabetes, clinical tasks, DM predictive techniques, and the performance of the predictive techniques used. A total of 38 papers published between 2000 and April 2017 were therefore selected and analyzed accordingly to address six research questions. The results show that Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is largely the type of diabetes that is most concerned by the studies and the prediction of blood glucose is the most investigated clinical task. Moreover, artificial neural networks were the most frequently used predictive technique which along with autogressive models, yield highest accuracy rates. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Data mining; Diabetes; Predictive techniques; Self-management; Systematic literature review; Systematic map"

Social media technologies facilitate that process in organizations, where they are known as Enterprise Social Networks (ESN). To increase potential benefits, organizations may run an implementation process to increase the ESN's acceptance and use. This study focused on one such platform, Yammer, which is making inroads into numerous industries. Specifically, we addressed Yammer's impact on communication and knowledge-sharing among organizational units in a multinational organization. This study unobtrusively assessed communication patterns before and after an ESN implementation process to measure impact. Data analysis performed on message interactions between employees on the Yammer platform suggested the implementation process had a positive impact on the number of messages, number of users, and weighted-degree SNA metric. This study also revealed that the implementation process positively impacted inter- and intra-organizational unit interactions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Computer mediated communication; Enterprise social networks; Implementation; Organizational communication; Social network analysis"

The theory of IT affordances provides a basis for theorizing how the use of online social commerce (OSC) technology facilitates the formation of social ties in an OSC context. In this paper, integrating theories of IT affordances and social ties, we develop a model to explore how the six sub-dimensions of OSC IT affordances (i.e., visibility, metavoicing, triggered attending, guidance shopping, social connecting, and trading) aid buyers and sellers in building strong and weak OSC ties. A survey of 511 buyers from WeChat shows that five of the six IT affordances enhance the quality of interactivity, and thereby facilitate social ties (both strong and weak), which in turn contribute to buyers’ repurchase intentions. Additionally, the findings confirm the positive moderating effect of perceived effectiveness of e-commerce institutional mechanisms (PEEIM) on the strong tie formation process. This paper advances the affordances and social tie literature by examining the antecedents and outcomes of OSC social ties in more detail. Our findings not only benefit the researchers in interpreting how technology helps form different types of relationships in OSC, but also assists practitioners in developing better OSC management strategy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Interactivity; IT affordance; Online social commerce; PEEIM; Repurchase intention; Social ties; Tie strength"

In this paper, we propose to apply augmented reality to improve the way of teaching in medical schools and institutes. We propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) for gesture recognition, which recognizes the human's gestures as a certain instruction. We use augmented reality technology for anatomy learning, which simulates the scenarios where students can learn Anatomy with HoloLens instead of rare specimens. We have used the mesh reconstruction to reconstruct the 3D specimens. A user interface featured augment reality has been designed which fits the common process of anatomy learning. To improve the interaction services, we have applied gestures as an input source and improve the accuracy of gestures recognition by an updated deep convolutional neural network. Our proposed learning method includes many separated train procedures using cloud computing. Each train model and its related inputs have been sent to our cloud and the results are returned to the server. The suggested cloud includes windows and android devices, which are able to install deep convolutional learning libraries. Compared with previous gesture recognition, our approach is not only more accurate but also has more potential for adding new gestures. Furthermore, we have shown that neural networks can be combined with augmented reality as a rising field, and the great potential of augmented reality and neural networks to be employed for medical learning and education systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","3D reconstruction; Augmented reality; Medical education; Mobile cloud; Neural network"

Hence, it has been criticised that it is likely to hold subjective views of the individuals who participate in a brainstorming session and that SWOT factors are not prioritized by their significance thus it may result in an improper strategic action. While most studies of SWOT analysis have only focused on solving these shortcomings separately, this study offers an approach to diminish both shortcomings by applying Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) to identify SWOT based on customer satisfaction surveys which produces prioritized SWOT corresponding to the customers’ perception. Through the use of IPA based SWOT analysis, it is expected that a organisation can efficiently formulate strategic planning as the SWOT factors that should be maintained or improved can be clearly identified based on customers’ viewpoints. The application of the IPA based SWOT analysis was illustrated and evaluated through a case study of Higher Education Institutions in Thailand. The evaluation results showed that SWOT analysis of the case study accurately reflected the organisation's situations thereby demonstrating the validity of this study. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Customer satisfaction surveys; Importance-Performance Analysis; SWOT analysis"

Survey participants were asked to rate the severity of the problems faced by their organization as their social media business profile (SMBP) evolves. Our findings reveal two waves of problems occurring where severity levels increase through the evolution of the SMBP. The most prominent problems are failure to develop metrics for measuring returns on investment and failure to translate data into actionable insights, both of which are related to analytics. We also show that larger organizations tend to experience more strategic problems, while organizations of the service sector experience more severe problems. In identifying the types of problems that emerge and when to expect them during SMBP evolution, this study enables practitioners to anticipate and develop plans that mitigate such problems and to harness the full potential of social media. © 2018","Social media business profile; Social media management; Stages-of-growth"

One stream of online customer behavior research has focused on systems quality in determining systems success, whereas another stream of research has focused on the effects of online incidents, including online waiting interruptions and service failures, on consumer behaviors. This study attempts to bridge the two streams of research and to explain e-service customer post-adoption behaviors in a unified model from the perspective of the Affective Events Theory (AET). Previous research examining this phenomenon has been guided by the Expectancy Confirmation Theory (ECT). The current study advances these theories to explain customer retention behaviors using the Affective Events Theory. With the AET, the current study proposes that e-service customer behaviors are determined by three major constructs: perceived site quality, affective reactions, and cognitive appraisal of incident-handling. Three surveys were conducted and the findings support the proposed model, positing that e-service customer retention behaviors are determined by perceived site quality and cognitive appraisal of incidents-handling. Post-adoption behaviors investigated in the study include continuance intention, complaint intention (negative word-of-mouth), and recommendation intention (positive word-of-mouth).

The theory of planned behavior was employed to demonstrate how these factors influence behavioral intentions to adopt an open data badge. This research used a survey method to examine to what extent those attitudinal, normative, resource factors influence psychologists’ behavioral intentions to adopt an open data badge, and therefore engage in data sharing behaviors. A national survey (n = 341) across the field of psychology showed that perceived benefit and perceived risk had significant positive and negative relationships with attitude toward the open data badge respectively. Furthermore, attitude toward open data badge and norm of data sharing had significant positive influences on psychologists’ behavioral intentions to adopt the open data badge. Perceived effort had a significant negative relationship with the behavioral intention to adopt the open data badge, but had no effect toward attitudes surrounding the badge. However, this research found that the availability of a data repository and pressure from an open science journal did not have any significant relationship with behavioral intention to adopt the open data badge.

We also employed a quantitative test (multi-group analysis) to analyze the difference of path coefficients between the models of the two countries. The main results indicate similarities among the perceptions of the respondents that participated in the survey, but differences in coefficient magnitude. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Emerging economy; Mobile banking; Social influence; Structural equation model; Trust"

They can search for products and when ready, they pay and have the products delivered to their homes. By sharing personal information, they receive faster and more customized service. Because of the risk of loss of privacy, consumers need to balance their privacy concerns against the perceived value of enhanced mobile commerce. In this empirical study, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) is modified where perceived value replaces price value to represent the value of an IT artifact that has no direct costs attributable to it. The framework is extended to include constructs from the privacy calculus. In addition, the construct of personal innovativeness is added as a moderator with the anticipation that owners of smartphones who are more personally innovative will be more willing to share information. From an empirical study of Canadian smartphone owners, the results show that perceived privacy concerns influence perceived value and that intention to use is significantly influenced by hedonic motivation and perceived value. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","mobile commerce; Perceived value; Personal innovativeness; Privacy concerns; UTAUT2"

Consequently, this study focuses on how a social media brand page develops customer commitment and encourages them to perceive that future conflicts with the company can be resolved for their mutual benefit. On the basis of a review of the literature on customer value theory and commitment, this study develops an integrative model that explores the antecedents of functional conflict and the boundary condition under which brand page commitment enhances functional conflict. The model is tested using data collected from 293 followers of brand pages on a social networking site. The results demonstrate the salient roles of customer values and commitment in determining customer perceptions of future conflicts. By shifting scholarly attention from economic outcomes characterized by purchase intention to relationship outcomes characterized by functional conflict, the findings contribute to the research of the business implications of social networking sites. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Brand page; Commitment; Customer value; Functional conflict; Social media"

A number of previous studies have investigated various social networks and probed in the core knowledge of integrated social networks. While social network knowledge is general and extensive, few studies have delved into the core knowledge of individual social networks, especially Facebook, which is a social network with over 1.7 billion users worldwide. Therefore, this study aimed to elaborate on the core knowledge of Facebook. In this study, a total of 4429 relevant academic papers were collected from the Web of Science, an online electronic database. Then, citation analysis and co-citation analysis were adopted to identify 50 highly cited academic papers to form a co-citation matrix. Finally, cluster analysis and multi-dimensional scaling analysis were employed to determine the core knowledge of Facebook. The research results showed that there are six points of core knowledge: (1) the behavior analysis of users; (2) the social impact of social networks; (3) the influence and application of Facebook in universities; (4) the evaluation of use motivation and theoretical models; (5) privacy risk and interpersonal impression; and (6) the strategies of social networks.

However, few studies have examined how Twitter's features can support the different communication patterns that occur during different phases of disaster events. Based on the literature of disaster communication and Media Synchronicity Theory, we identify distinct disaster phases and the two communication types—crisis communication and risk communication—that occur during those phases. We investigate how Twitter's representational features, including words, URLs, hashtags, and hashtag importance, influence the average retweet time—that is, the average time it takes for retweet to occur—as well as how such effects differ depending on the type of disaster communication. Our analysis of tweets from the 2013 Colorado floods found that adding more URLs to tweets increases the average retweet time more in risk-related tweets than it does in crisis-related tweets. Further, including key disaster-related hashtags in tweets contributed to faster retweets in crisis-related tweets than in risk-related tweets. Our findings suggest that the influence of Twitter's media capabilities on rapid tweet propagation during disasters may differ based on the communication processes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Communication process; Disaster communication; Media Synchronicity Theory; Retweet; Topic modeling; Twitter"

The literature derived from the recent industrial organisation is rich in theoretical models, aiming at the study of price structure and product design, which maximise the participation of the groups, the profits of the firms, and the value created for the entire ecosystem. The current paper interprets and adapts the theoretical model of the two-sided market in order to fit the case of a SDI. The purpose is to highlight the relevance of a two-sided market approach for analysing a SDI dynamics. The focal research question is how spatial data infrastructure, through a platform management process, can transition from a government-funded entity to a self-sustaining operation. The analysis relies on the specific case of the GEOSUD SDI, focusing on strategies ensuring the interest of image-based application developers and satellite image users. The results show that the theory of two-sided markets brings complementary elements for SDI development strategies, by proposing a framework of reasoning, which not only allows for a better understanding of the outflows already established, but also provides tools to accompany the strategic reflection of public institutions and entrepreneurs, who tend to support the uses of data and services derived from remote sensing. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Network externalities; Satellite information; Spatial data infrastructure; Two-sided market"

Prior studies indicate that employees often use ESM to access knowledge in other domains or complex knowledge. But connecting employees is only part of the picture – while ESM offer the possibility of accessing domain specific and complex knowledge, the flow of such knowledge might remain inhibited by the perceived effort required to codify them for sharing. This study identifies salient ESM affordances that can alleviate the perceived effort of sharing domain-specific and complex knowledge. Results of a survey of 303 employees working in organizations using ESM indicate that domain-specific knowledge is perceived as less effortful to codify when the affordance of visibility is strong (i.e., the affordance negatively moderates the positive relationship between knowledge specificity and perceived codification effort), and complex knowledge is perceived as less effortful to codify when the affordances of association and editability are strong.

Traditional recommendation systems (RS) suggest items based only on feedback submitted by users in form of ratings. These RS are not competent to deal with definite user preferences due to emerging and situation dependent user-generated content on social media, these situations are known as contextual dimensions. Though the relationship between contextual dimensions and user's preferences has been demonstrated in various studies, only a few studies have explored about prioritization of varying contextual dimensions. The usage of all contextual dimensions unnecessary raises the computational complexity and negatively influences the recommendation results. Thus, the initial impetus has been made to construct a neural network in order to determine the pertinent contextual dimensions. The experiments are conducted on real-world movies data-LDOS CoMoDa dataset. The results of neural networks demonstrate that contextual dimensions have a significant effect on users’ preferences which in turn exerts an intense impact on the satisfaction level of users. Finally, tensor factorization model is employed to evaluate and validate accuracy by including neural network's identified pertinent dimensions which are modeled as tensors. The result shows improvement in recommendation accuracy by a wider margin due to the inclusion of the pertinent dimensions in comparison to irrelevant dimensions.

IoT-assisted mobile cloud based e-healthcare services are making giant strides and are likely to change the conventional ways of healthcare service delivery. Though numerous approaches for preventing unauthorized access to information exchanged between a mobile phone and cloud platform do exist, but there is no security mechanism to prevent unauthorized access by the cloud administrators. With an aim to ensure security of client data such as Electronic Patient Records (EPR), we propose a novel high-capacity and reversible data hiding approach for securely embedding EPR within the medical images using Optimal Pixel Repetition (OPR). OPR converts every pixel of the input image to a 2 × 2 block to facilitate reversibility by ensuring all the pixels in a 2 × 2 block to have different values. Since a 2 × 2 block is comprised of 4-pixel elements, which could be arranged in sixteen possible ways; we generate a lookup table corresponding to sixteen possible positions of pixels. EPR hiding in each block is achieved by permuting the pixels of a block according to the four-bit word of secret data, resulting in a histogram invariant stego image. The histogram invariance improves the robustness of the proposed scheme to statistical attacks. A stego image is said to hide embedded data securely, when it provides better imperceptivity for an appreciably high payload. Thus, while using information embedding approach for securing client data on a mobile-cloud platform, high imperceptivity is a desirable feature. Experimental results show that average PSNR obtained is 42 dB for payload 1.25 bpp by our scheme, showing its effectiveness for preventing unauthorized access to client's sensitive data. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cloud-assisted multimedia; Data hiding; e-healthcare; Internet of things; Multimedia data management; Payload; Reversibility; Security; Steganography"

The present study uses data gathered through two field surveys and analyses the relationships among three main SocioCitizenry constructs: quality anticipation, trust configuration, and approved adaptation. The following factors are examined with respect to the aforementioned three constructs: differential influences of familiarity with social media and government services; perceived importance of interactions with government services; social media quality reputation; and family members’ and friends’ perceptions of social media quality. Overall, results show that anticipated governmental social media quality influences configured trust, which in turn influences the extent of approved adaptation.

Design/methodology/approach: The theoretical basis for the study is the widely used SERVQUAL model and we leverage a dataset uniquely suited for the analysis: the full database of online reviews generated on the website of the leading price comparison engine in Italy. Adopting a weakly supervised topic model, we extract the dimensions of service quality from these reviews. We use a linear regression to compare service quality dimensions between positive and negative opinions. Findings: First, we show that socialized textual data, not just quantitative ratings, provide a wealth of customer service information that can be used to measure service quality. Second, we demonstrate that the distribution of topics in online opinions differs significantly between positive and negative reviews. Specifically, we find that concerns about merchant responsiveness dominate negative reviews. Practical implications: Our research has important implications for designers of online review systems and marketers seeking novel approaches to the measurement of service quality. Our study shows that evaluation systems designed considering the knowledge extracted directly from customers’ review lead to a service quality measurement that not only is theory-based, but also more accurate. Originality/value: We believe this is the first study to combine the advanced text mining technique of topic modeling and SERVQUAL to extract specific service dimensions from socialized data. Using these advanced techniques, we point to systematic differences between positive and negative customer opinions. We are not aware of any study that has shown these differences with either traditional approaches (i.e., survey data) or modern techniques (e.g. text mining). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Online review; Service quality; SERVQUAL; Text mining; Topic model"

So, clear visualization, big sensing level, and better quality of service (QoS) is the foremost priority. This paper proposes the window-based Rate Control Algorithm (w-RCA) to optimize the medical quality of service (m-QoS) in the mobile edge computing based healthcare by considering the network parameters for instance, peak-to-mean ratio (PMR), standard deviation (Std.dev), delay and jitter during 8 min medical video stream named “Navigation to the Uterine Horn, transection of the horn and re-anastomosis’ transmission over 5 G networks. The performance of the proposed w-RCA is evaluated and compared with the conventional battery smoothing algorithm (BSA) and Baseline by using MPEG-4 encoder for optimizing m-QoS at the source or the server side. The experimental results demonstrate that the w-RCA outperforms the BSA and Baseline by optimizing QoS in remote healthcare application i.e., Tele-surgery. Besides, it is observed and analyzed that w-RCA produces better and effective results at small buffer and window sizes unlike BSA and Baseline by adopting large buffer size during QoS optimization. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","BSA; Medical healthcare; Mobile edge computing; QoS; Window-based rate control algorithm"

Connectivity on 7/24 basis between human to device and device to device have a crucial role in individuals’ lives. Therefore, Mobile Cloud System (MCC) has become an indispensable tool. Parallel with the rapid developments in the Internet of Things, convergence has become an important issue. Our proposed method, accordingly, can be converged with mobile-cloud environments with cloud computing in handling healthcare information. This study uses Virtual Dedicated Server (VDS) as 4 VCPU and 8 GB RAM and proposes a model based on the Android based mobile phones for stroke patients with cardioembolic (689) and cryptogenic (528) subtypes. The system set up through this study has two basic application elements which are mobile application and server application. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) module is beneficial for classifying the two stroke subtypes while server application is used for saving the data from the patients. Accordingly, our model guarantees availability, security, and scalability as a system for stroke patients applying Stroke dataset for ANN algorithm, Multilayer Perceptron Algorithm (MLP), which has been done for the first time in literature with big data in this scope. The main contributions are: (1) The outcomes will display an individual unique social insurance framework. (2) The outcomes will be utilized for the distinguishing proof of stroke-related data to be gathered by cell phones that are Android based. (3) Stroke patients will find out about their condition of well-being through an ANN application programming interface, which will provide a sort of organization for the patients. Overall, an efficient and user-friendly stroke determination human services framework has been presented through this Healthcare System for patients. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Android; Medical support healthcare system; Mobile Cloud Computing; Multilayer Perceptron; Stroke"

Users of social tagging tools are driven to participate and add tags by extrinsic and intrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivation is dominating research as a main predictor of why users use information systems. Social tagging tools, as a subset of social media tools, are distinguished by their unique social aspect that makes intrinsic motivation a potential driver for users to add tags to content. Intrinsic motivation, when applied to social tagging tools, could entail many shades that represent different users’ motives for using such tools. In this paper, we add a rich concept of intrinsic motivation to include hedonism as a main predictor of users’ behavior on social tagging tools. We empirically validate a previously proposed theoretical model of three dimensional concepts of hedonism with three components describing individuals’ hedonic state when interacting with social tagging tools: explorability, curiosity, and enjoyment. After a robust and thorough data analysis using structured equation modeling, the results confirm our theoretical model and suggest using a richer concept of enjoyment to reflect a hedonic dimension when investigating intrinsic motivation with interactive social media tools. Our validated model could be the spark of new factors that have the potential to influence user acceptance of information systems in general and in social media tools.

But, at the same time, a myriad of users have deviated themselves, temporarily or permanently, from social media use due to social media fatigue. Scholars have investigated different antecedents and consequences of social media fatigue. However, empirical relationships between psychosocial wellbeing and social media fatigue are currently not known. To bridge this gap, the current study utilises the stressor-strain-outcome framework (SSO) to examine whether psychosocial wellbeing measures, such as compulsive media use and fear of missing out, trigger fatigue and, furthermore, whether social media fatigue results in anxiety and depression. The study utilised repeated cross-sectional methodology whereby two waves of data (N = 1554, 1144) were collected to test the research model with adolescent social media users in India. The study findings suggest that compulsive media use significantly triggered social media fatigue, which later result in elevated anxiety and depression. Fear of missing out indirectly predicted social media fatigue through mediation of compulsive social media use. The theoretical and practical implications, limitations of the present study and agenda for future studies are presented and discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Adolescents; Anxiety; Compulsive media use; Depression; Fear of missing out; Repeated cross-sectional survey; Social media fatigue"

Thus, this study recognises the need to test the main factors that could predict the use of mobile banking as well as how using such a system could contribute to both customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. The conceptual model of this study combines two models (i.e. UTAUT2 and the D&M IS Success Model). A questionnaire survey was conducted to collect the required data from convenience sampling of Saudi bank customers. The main factors – performance expectancy, price value, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, habit, system quality and service quality – were found to have a significant impact on actual use behaviour. This study was cross-sectional, therefore future studies should implement longitudinal studies in order to re-collect the findings. Further, this study adopted convenience sampling of Saudi M-Banking users. This may adversely impact the issue of generalisability to the whole population. The gap in the M-Banking literature in Saudi Arabia would be bridged by proposing a comprehensive conceptual model that scrupulously clarifies the use of M-Banking from the perspective of Saudi users. Furthermore, this study would consider the adoption of numeric data in order to inferentially analyse them using SEM. This in turn would assist in generalising the findings to the whole Saudi population. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","IS Success Model; Mobile banking; Saudi Arabia; UTAUT2"

As opposed to this well-developed stream of research, we explore and contribute to another potential but under-developed stream of research: the impact of corruption on e-government maturity. Drawing on the institutional perspective to construe corruption, we argue that corruption in three basic national institutions (political, legal, and media) and two national stakeholder service systems (business and citizen systems) in a country can hinder its e-government maturity. Specifically, we propose a holistic framework that conceptualizes the negative influence of corruption in national institutions and national stakeholder service systems on e-government maturity by drawing on five key theoretical perspectives—agency theory, control theory, theory of X-inefficiency, rent-seeking theory, and trust in institutions—grounded in corruption and information systems project management literature. The proposed conceptual framework is expected to (1) guide future empirical research on “corruption–e-government” phenomenon by providing rich theoretical explanations; and (2) offer a comprehensive strategy for practitioners and policymakers dealing with e-government projects and initiatives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agency theory; Conceptual framework; Control theory; Corruption; E-government maturity; Institutions; Rent-seeking theory; Stakeholder service systems; Theory of X-inefficiency; Trust in institutions"

These motivators have mostly been understood in terms of the intrinsic-extrinsic perspective, and participation has been treated as a black box. This study extends understanding of the primary motivators by clarifying their differential effects in terms of the distal-proximal perspective of motivation, and distinguishing among participation in (i.e., choice of) unstructured tasks, high-commitment tasks, and interdependent tasks. Findings based on a survey of 283 crowdsourcing participants indicate that those motivated to develop competence (i.e., learn new knowledge and skills) tend to choose high-commitment tasks requiring more effort and therefore opportunities to improve ability, rather than focusing on task structuredness or interdependence. Those who are motivated to foster social affiliation tend to focus more on choosing highly interdependent tasks requiring coordination and collaboration with other participants. Those motivated by payment tend to focus on demonstrating competence relative to others and are therefore more likely to choose structured tasks with clear, comparable output. These findings enhance the conceptual clarity of different motivators, and inform crowdsourcing organizers on the motivator to focus on based on task characteristics. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Crowdsourcing; Motivation; Task choice"

Although the factors influencing one specific knowledge contribution or knowledge-sharing behavior (e.g., adding) have been widely examined, the research on the factors that affect another type of knowledge contribution, i.e., knowledge integration, is still rare. Considering the collaborative nature of knowledge integration, beyond the value-centric logic of knowledge contribution, we propose a value-justice model of knowledge integration. We further identify the boundary conditions under which the proposed value-justice model works by investigating the moderating role of knowledge equivocality. A survey was conducted in a well-known Wiki-based website in China, namely, Baidu Baike, to test the research model and hypotheses. Our results show that both perceived justice and perceived value influence knowledge integration, which in turn affects knowledge quality, and knowledge equivocality strengthens the relationship between perceived justice / perceived value and knowledge integration and the relationship between knowledge integration and knowledge quality.

To support CCCP, the cross-company data is usually transformed to a set of similar normal distribution of target company data prior to building a CCCP model. However, it is still unclear which data transformation method is most effective in CCCP. Also, the impact of data transformation methods on CCCP model performance using different classifiers have not been comprehensively explored in the telecommunication sector. In this study, we devised a model for CCCP using data transformation methods (i.e., log, z-score, rank and box-cox) and presented not only an extensive comparison to validate the impact of these transformation methods in CCCP, but also evaluated the performance of underlying baseline classifiers (i.e., Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Gradient Boosted Tree (GBT), Single Rule Induction (SRI) and Deep learner Neural net (DP)) for customer churn prediction in telecommunication sector using the above mentioned data transformation methods. We performed experiments on publicly available datasets related to the telecommunication sector. The results demonstrated that most of the data transformation methods (e.g., log, rank, and box-cox) improve the performance of CCCP significantly. However, the Z-Score data transformation method could not achieve better results as compared to the rest of the data transformation methods in this study. Moreover, it is also investigated that the CCCP model based on NB outperform on transformed data and DP, KNN and GBT performed on the average, while SRI classifier did not show significant results in term of the commonly used evaluation measures (i.e., probability of detection, probability of false alarm, area under the curve and g-mean). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Box-cox; Churn prediction; Cross-company; Data transformation; Log; Rank; Z-Score"

As our methodological approach, we conducted a longitudinal survey study from 2012 to 2014 to of two teams of staff employed with a Norwegian furniture manufacturer. Each team included designers, production engineers, and salespeople. The survey included the teams and the upper corporate team. The survey monitored the design, production and market processes involved in launching furniture to the marketplace (30 months). The teams decided to rotate their professional roles as designers, production engineers, and salespeople. This rotating role mechanism and socialization process encouraged the sharing of knowledge. The team members transformed their tacit knowledge into collective explicit knowledge, allowing it to deliver innovative results within a time limit. As a theoretical implication, we have found a workable means of transforming tacit, productive, individual and collective knowing into explicit actionable knowledge. Productive team knowledge was converted into tacit managerial knowledge in upper management personnel, enabling the group to translate knowledge into explicit business actions. We propose, as a general theory, that by rotating professional roles within a team individual tacit knowledge can be transformed into collective explicit knowledge. The productive team tacit knowledge that was transferred was identified as expert, nodding, familiarity and holistic knowledge. As a practical implication, we show that rotating professional roles within a team works when a team is afforded enough time to develop a socialization process. When professionals are given direction, trust, responsibility and time to develop results, they break out of their comfort zones and deliver extraordinary results together. As a practical implication, we show that this process can be planned, managed and controlled. Role rotation facilitates both the creation of high-performance teams and the transformation of tacit professional knowledge into explicit knowledge. The transformation of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge helps increase efficiency and effectiveness in knowledge-intensive corporations. Therefore, practically, is it possible to create a corporate flywheel from tacit knowledge? The conversion of productive tacit knowledge into tacit managerial knowledge converted into specific business actions can create an explicit corporate flywheel while maintaining tacit knowledge as a competitive advantage. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Knowledge modes; Knowledge sharing; Performance; Tacit knowledge; Teams"

This information is harnessed by business entities to measure the level of customer satisfaction but its application in disaster response is still in its inflection point. Social networks are increasingly used for emergency communications and help related requests. During disaster situations, such emergency requests need to be mined from the pool of big data for providing timely help. Though government organizations and emergency responders work together through their respective national disaster response framework, the sentiment of the affected people during and after the disaster determines the success of the disaster response and recovery process. In this paper, we propose a big data driven approach for disaster response through sentiment analysis. The proposed model collects disaster data from social networks and categorize them according to the needs of the affected people. The categorized disaster data are classified through machine learning algorithm for analyzing the sentiment of the people. Various features like, parts of speech and lexicon are analyzed to identify the best classification strategy for disaster data. The results show that lexicon based approach is suitable for analyzing the needs of the people during disaster. The practical implication of the proposed methodology is the real-time categorization and classification of social media big data for disaster response and recovery.

However, this can only happen if users successfully accept BI&A and use it effectively. Analytical decision processes are often characterized by non-routine and ill-structured tasks and decisions, making individuals’ work styles more pronounced. Aligning on one hand what a BI&A solution can offer and, on the other, the changing needs and expectations of users, the way they like to work – their work style, can thus be difficult. This illustrates the importance of compatibility evaluations in the BI&A context, including perceptions of the technology fit with the user's work needs and style, along with the fit with the organizational decision processes and organizational values when deciding to use BI&A.

Despite its growth much is not known about factors that motivate users beyond their initial adoption to engage in post-adoption behaviors such as continuance intention to use social commerce to the point of becoming addictive users. Two predominant views have been used to study social commerce in the literature; one emphasizes the role of affect on behavioral outcomes (i.e., dual processing view) while the other suggests that affect is not important in use decisions (i.e., the independency view). Moreover, both views offer inconsistent results on understanding how consumers use social commerce sites. To address this inconsistency in the literature, this paper proposes and empirically evaluates a model that integrates the existing views to extend our understanding on social commerce post-adoption behaviors.

These tweets were analysed through social media analytics approaches (i.e. CUP framework). The study presents the top technologies in health domain through hashtag analysis and top diseases (acute, chronic, communicable and non-communicable) through word analysis and their association through co-occurrence of words within the tweets. The association depicts technology had been used in treating, identifying and heeling of the various diseases. The discussion on social media is skewed towards computing algorithms. The acute and chronic diseases were discussed on social media, and our study indicates that statistically, there is no difference in the discussion of acute and chronic diseases. The communicable and non-communicable diseases are also discussed on social media, and our study indicates no statistically difference in the discussion of communicable and non-communicable diseases which signifies users are referring to Twitter for discussing various type of diseases irrespective of acute, chronic, communicable and non-communicable diseases. Future researchers can use the study as the evidence of extracting insights related to socio-technical perspective from Twitter data. The literature contains lot of evidences where technology had been useful in health domain, but the bigger picture of how the various technologies are being related to health domain is missing, therefore this study tries to contribute to this area by mining tweets. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Diseases discussion on twitter; Emerging technology; Health technology; Twitter analytics"

Organizations have spent a lot of time, money, and resources on social media ads. However, there is always a challenge in how organizations can design social media advertising to successfully attract customers and motivate them to purchase their brands. Thus, this study aims to identify and test the main factors related to social media advertising that could predict purchase intention. The conceptual model was proposed based on three factors from the extending Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) (performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, and habit) along with interactivity, informativeness, and perceived relevance. The data was collected using a questionnaire survey of 437 participants. The key results of structural equation modelling (SEM) largely supported the current model's validity and the significant impact of performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, interactivity, informativeness, and perceived relevance on purchase intentions. This study will hopefully provide a number of theoretical and practical guidelines on how marketers can effectively plan and implement their ads over social media platforms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Advertising; Customers; Marketing; Purchase intention; Social media"

This paper examines the drivers of collaborative innovation capability, and its effects on the digital collaboration capability. Based on the technology-push and need-pull perspective as well as operational capability hierarchy view, we proposed the model of antecedents and outcomes of higher-level operational capability, such as collaborative innovation capability. We tested the research hypotheses using a field survey of 184 Chinese corporations. The research model was validated using hierarchical regression analysis with the data collected from the survey data. The results provide strong support for the proposed research model. In particular, we found that as hypothesized, the fit of platform technology and collaborative business need is the critical driver of collaborative innovation capability. Furthermore, the higher-level operational capability (i.e., collaborative innovation capability) impacts on the lower-level operational capability (i.e., digital collaboration capability). Especially, the impact of the fit on digital collaboration capability is completely mediated by collaborative innovation capability. By integrating the technology-push and need-pull perspective as well as operational capability hierarchy literature, this paper provides significant implications for antecedents and outcomes of collaborative innovation capabilities under the platform collaboration environment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Collaborative business need; Collaborative innovation capability; Digital collaboration capability; Platform technology"

The aim of the study is to identify the critical farctors affecting the physicians’ adoption of EHR in healthcare system of Bangladesh by extending the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to include Personal Innovativeness in Information Technology and Resistance to Change. A cross-sectional survey questionnaire was used to collect data from 300 participants in different private and public hospitals in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh. The study used partial least square (PLS) method, a statistical analysis technique based on the structural equation modeling (SEM), to analyze the collected data. The results of the study determined that Social Influence (β = 0.19, P < 0.05), Facilitating Conditions (β = 0.19, P < 0.05), and Personal Innovativeness in Information Technology (β = 0.19, P < 0.05) had a significant influence on physicians’ Behavioral Intention to adopt the EHR system, whereas Performance Expectancy (β = 0.08, P > 0.05), Effort Expectancy (β = -0.02, P > 0.05), and Resistance to Change (β = 0.03, P > 0.05) had no significant influence. The findings suggest that policymakers should increase the adoption of the EHR system by developing social strategies to encourage physicians to stimulate each other to use the EHR system and ensuring technical sufficiency, training to facilitate the use of the EHR system. In addition, the policymakers should identify physicians who possess a propensity to experiment with new information technologies as well as reduce existing challenges and barriers such as computers crush, poor infrastructure with erratic power supply etc. Moreover, we identify future research areas that provide scholars opportunities to push theoretical and empirical boundaries and offer further insights into the study of the EHR system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","eHealth; EHR; Physician; UTAUT"

In this paper, we propose a cerebral stroke detection solution that employs the cloud to store and analyze data in order to provide statistics to public institutions. Moreover, the prototype of the application is presented. The three most important symptoms of cerebral strokes were considered to develop the tasks that are conducted. Thus, the first task detects smiles, the second task employs voice recognition to determine if a sentence is repeated correctly and, the third task determines if the arms can be raised. Several tests were performed in order to verify the application.

Total Interpretive Structural Modelling (TISM) is an enhancement of interpretive structural modeling (ISM) to explore hierarchical models that aid in theory building in information and organization management. It is based on pair comparison method to generate a hierarchical digraph, which is then translated into the interpretive model by interpreting both nodes and links in the digraph. The relationships in both ISM and TISM could be binary or fuzzy. However, a missing dimension of these structural models is the polarity or direction of relationships. A relationship between a pair of elements could be having positive or negative polarity. This aspect has been widely used in the feedback structures as causal influence diagrams (CIDs) in system dynamics methodology. This paper is using the learning from CIDs to introduce polarity of relationships in ISM and TISM. The polarity of relationships will further refine ISM/TISM as a more explanatory model for theory building. This enhanced model not only provides hypothesis formulation simply as a driver-dependence relationship but also addresses whether the driving variable(s) will influence the dependent variable positively or negatively.

Although the cloud offers rich opportunities for transforming businesses—innovating existing services and introducing creative new ones—it also involves risks that business managers must identify and resolve to successfully drive innovation efforts. However, no comprehensive models are available to help managers assess and mitigate the risks they face. To address this void, we reviewed extant literature on cloud computing from a business innovation perspective to uncover the myriad challenges managers confront as they seek to leverage cloud technology in the ongoing transformation of their organization's service offerings. Combining this systematic literature analysis with relevant theory, we synthesized an integrated model for managing risk during innovation of cloud-based business services. The model identifies three types of risks (services, technology, and process risks) and four types of resolutions (stakeholder engagement, technology development, innovation planning, and innovation control). The model also helps managers identify their organization's general risk profile and link that profile to a specific configuration of resolutions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Business services; Cloud technology; Innovation; Literature review; Risk management"

Research on online product reviews, however, suggests that the relationship between the length of online reviews available to consumers and effectiveness measures is positive and linear. To explain this discrepancy, we argue that review length has a negative curvilinear (inverted-U-shaped) relationship with effectiveness and that such a relationship has seldom been observed in previous studies because those have analyzed data collected in low-constraint settings of information processing. The analysis of data about online reviews for free and paid apps, collected on two mobile app stores, provides consistent evidence in support of the hypothesized curvilinear relationship. The findings suggest that maximum cognitive load is experienced at lower review lengths for paid apps than for free apps and that the marginal utility for the majority of review length observations is positive or nonsignificant for free apps and negative for paid apps.

The findings reveal that SNSs’ participation motivations positively influence customer participation, which in turn significantly affects brand trust and brand loyalty. Consequently, both brand trust and brand loyalty positively influence branding co-creation in brand communities on social media.

For incumbent firms in these low-tech industries, the disruption brings not only plenty of opportunities but also numerous threats. Firms that quickly embrace the digital era by profoundly changing their incumbent strategies, systems, operational habits, and business models have great chances to outperform their competitors and succeed within this dynamic environment. One digital strategy that might be adopted by incumbent firms in the low-tech industries to seize the opportunities brought by digital disruption is to integrate their resource orchestration actions with advanced information technologies (ITs). Given the strong connection between firms’ resource orchestration actions and their competitive advantages, as well as the increasingly vital role of ITs in contemporary business operations, it is an imperative to investigate the impacts of ITs on the resource orchestration processes of modern enterprises. Additionally, for incumbent firms operating in the low-tech industries, integrating their resource management with modern ITs might help them effectively identify and accumulate unique resources, develop their capabilities, and create value through continuous reconfiguration of resources. Therefore, low-tech firms that strive to adopt modern information technologies in their resource orchestration process are more likely to achieve improved organizational performance and competitive advantages than their competitors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Information technologies; Low-tech industries; Resource orchestration process"

Steering and navigation tasks through an environment constitute an essential activity in our daily lives. They have a high degree of practical value in a variety of domains, such as public area design, architectural Wayfinding, geo-positioning and navigation, as well as urban planning and environmental design. At times, people with a visual impairment may also have problems in navigating autonomously and without personal assistance, especially in unknown environments (outdoor and indoor) using a smartphone. There could also be emergency situations in which the receiving of information in real time could be crucial. People with motor disabilities usually need information to avoid environments with obstacles, to arrive at a target or to manage touchscreens in daily activities and different environments. The use of landmarks is therefore vitally important in human navigation. Wayfinding systems must change, given that according to the United Nations (UN) Development Program, people with a disability represent around 10% of the world's population, which is approximately 650 million people. Additionally, according to the World Health Organization, the world's population of people 60 years of age and older has doubled since 1980 and is predicted to reach 2 billion by 2050. Most Wayfinding applications in the Smartphone market suffer from at least one of the following problems: the information is not dynamic, the design is not universal or the interface is not adapted to different users and preferences. Accordingly, apps do not currently have a universal design. The GAWA platform provides a universal and accessible solution to manage Wayfinding applications that focuses on people with a disability in outdoor and indoor environments in Smartcities. According to the results, the platform could be used for performing activities in their daily lives. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Accessibility; Collaborative process integration; Disability; Semantic web service; Web technologies"

Thus, intelligence and competencies matters at the organizational workplace. For most knowledge intensive organizations is fundamental the continuous availability and development of domain expertise. This paper describes an ongoing research project to develop an organizational knowledge architecture that is being specified and developed to support collaboration tasks as well as design and model predictive data analysis and insights for organizational development. The primary goal of this research is to create a suitable architecture for use, initially, in intranet (corporate portal) collaborative procedures, but also scalable for later use in more generic forms of ontology-driven knowledge management systems. The designed architecture and functionalities aim to create coherent web data layers for intranet learning and predictive analysis, defining the vocabulary and semantics for knowledge sharing and reuse projects. Regarding intellectual capital definition, this research argues that effective knowledge management are based on the dynamic nature of the organizational knowledge, and predictive data analysis and insights identification can transform and add value to an organization.

Nowadays, social media is significantly modifying the patterns in the use of technology to support knowledge management practices in teams. At the same time, the literature shows that transactive memory system (TMS), which refers to how team members share their distributed knowledge and expertise, is an important factor affecting team performance. However, minimal effort has been made to elaborate on the precise role of social media in supporting TMS for enhancing absorptive capacity (ACAP) and knowledge creation capability (KCC) of the team, which in turn might influence team creative performance (TCP). Therefore, to address this gap in the literature, a theoretical model is developed and validated. Survey data collected from 334 members of 68 knowledge work teams indicated that social media use at work has a positive relationship with TMS and both social media use at work and TMS are positively related to ACAP and KCC of the team. Results further indicated that ACAP positively influenced KCC, and both have a direct relationship with TCP. This study shows that careful investment in social media by an organization can enhance meta-knowledge of “who knows what” within teams. Finally, exploring external knowledge alone is not enough. Instead, organizations must ensure external knowledge is utilized to create new knowledge to improve TCP. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Absorptive capacity; Knowledge creation capability; Social media; Team creative performance; Transactive memory system"

Based on these two theories, we built a research model of a user's coping reactions toward software trial restrictions. A field experiment was conducted to verify the hypotheses. Results show that negative disconfirmation on time/functionality restriction positively influenced the adoption of rational thinking strategy, which in turn positively influence the level of action coping. As a result, the degree to which rational thinking and action coping strategy were exploited positively influenced a user's willingness to pay for the full-version software.

To enable a richer understanding of DEST, this paper proposes an analytical lens combining Institutional Theory (IT) and Structuration Theory (ST) to explore the case of ‘Universal Credit’, a very large and ambitious DEST project in the UK. Analysis reveals that the institutional actors and structures played significant roles in the transformation process.

To fill these gaps in research, we will first present a theoretical conceptualization of the ISBI construct, and then develop and validate a measurement scale for the construct. Drawing from the ERG theory (Alderfer, 1972), Job Characteristic Theory (Hackman & Oldham, 1975, 1976) and other theoretical perspectives, we developed a theory-based TJW framework which consists of three levels: Task performance, Job interaction, and Work enrichment. The nomological validity of the scale was then successfully demonstrated by a partial test of the IS success model using the ISBI measure and a measure of the overall IS use. Finally, we demonstrated the diagnostic power of the construct through an exploratory research model which showed that, while task performance benefits have insignificant effect on satisfaction, both job interaction benefits and work enrichment effects have substantial effects on satisfaction. These study results have thus deepened our understanding on the underpinnings of IS usage behaviors and contributed to the cumulated research on IS success. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Construct development; ERG theory; IS success model; IS use benefits; Job Characteristics Theory"

Because of their unique characteristics, 3D annotations can be used to embed design and manufacturing information directly into a CAD model, which makes models effective vehicles to describe aspects of the geometry or provide additional information that can be connected to a particular geometric element. However, access to this information is often limited, difficult, and even unavailable to external applications. As model complexity and volume of information continue to increase, new and more powerful methods to interrogate these annotations are needed. In this paper, we demonstrate how 3D annotations can be effectively structured and integrated into a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system to provide a cohesive view of product-related information in a design environment. We present a strategy to organize and manage annotation information which is stored internally in a CAD model, and make it fully available through the PLM. Our method involves a dual representation of 3D annotations with enhanced data structures that provides shared and easy access to the information. We describe the architecture of a system which includes a software component for the CAD environment and a module that integrates with the PLM server. We validate our approach through a software prototype that uses a parametric modeling application and two commercial PLM packages with distinct data models. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","3D annotations; Design intent; Model-based engineering; PDM; PLM"

However, the process has been challenging to construction project management often resulting in failed projects. This necessitates an overwhelming need for a better approach. This paper presents a novel enterprise architecture framework for managing information about client requirements across all phases of a construction project and through-life of a built facility. The Integrated electronic Requirements Information Management Framework (eRIM) defines an information-centric, and process and service-oriented enterprise architecture approach to requirements management. It also describes how Information and Communication Technology (ICT)/Information Systems (IS) can support this information management. In developing the framework, findings from three case study projects were collated through observations, a questionnaire and interviews of construction practitioners. It is concluded that when implemented and incorporated in the management of construction projects, the eRIM architecture framework can potentially contribute towards improved and more efficient and effective management of client requirements across all stages of a project. Further work is outlined to operationalize the framework. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Construction project; Enterprise architecture; Framework; Information; Requirements management"

A commonly cited reason for ES implementation failures in the context of mandatory use is end users’ unwillingness to adopt or use systems or their sabotage thereof. Considering that expectations toward using newly implemented systems may promote positive user behavior, we examine the effects of outcome expectations on information systems (IS) use activity from the viewpoint of social cognitive theory. In addition, we propose a new surrogate variable for IS use activity in the mandatory use context, conative IS use, which is conceptualized as a second-order aggregate construct comprising three dimensions: immersion, reinvention, and learning. Conative IS use here refers to IS use that is proactively motivated by intentional and personal causes. The empirical results, based on data collected from 208 ES users, are found to support the conceptualization of the proposed variable. They also reveal that conative IS use is positively affected by outcome expectations. The findings of this study thus imply that the appropriate management of expectations may promote IS use behavior in the mandatory use context. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Conative IS use; Enterprise systems; Outcome expectations; Social cognitive theory"

The current paper bridges this gap through an exploration of upgrade intentions that incorporates the status quo bias (SQB) theory with Warshaw's purchase intention model (PIM). Data collected from 213 system users was analyzed using partial least squares (PLS). The results show that perceived need (positively) and inertia (negatively) influenced users’ behavioral intentions to upgrade to a new generation system. The indirect effects of inertia mediated the impact of incumbent system habit, procedural switching costs, and benefit loss costs on the behavioral intention to upgrade. In addition, perceived need mediated the impacts of procedural switching costs, benefit loss costs, and social norms on the behavioral intention to upgrade. Finally, inertia significantly weakened the positive relationship between perceived need and behavioral intention to upgrade. Based on these findings, this study proposed a theoretical framework of a technology upgrade model (TUM) and provided valuable information to both academics and practitioners that is highly pertinent to understanding IT upgrading behaviors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Inertia; Perceived need; Purchase intention model (PIM); Status quo bias (SQB) theory; Technology upgrade model"

We also examine the role of strategic partnerships in capturing value created through the exploitation of data resources. We conclude that while data often serve as a required resource for entry into new markets, strategic partnerships play a critical role in capturing value created through the exploitation of data resources. The emergent partnership structures are remarkably similar across the two organizations. They target rapid market expansion through encapsulation of data resources within highly scalable web services and the use of standardized legal contracts. We also find that temporal decoupling between value creation and value capture can expose firms to the erosion of the competitive advantage gained through investment in data resources. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; Competitive advantage; Data resource; Partnerships; Relational view; Resource-based view; Value capture; Value creation"

The recent proliferation of big data provides numerous opportunities for information-intensive services (IISs), in which information interactions exert the greatest effect on value creation. In the modern data-rich economy, understanding mechanisms and related factors of data-based value creation in IISs is essential for using IT to improve such services. This study identified nine key factors that characterize this data-based value creation: (1) data source, (2) data collection, (3) data, (4) data analysis, (5) information on the data source, (6) information delivery, (7) customer (information user), (8) value in information use, and (9) provider network. These factors were identified and defined through six action research projects with industry and government that used specific datasets to design new IISs and by analyzing data usage in 149 IIS cases. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of these factors for describing, analyzing, and designing the entire value creation chain, from data collection to value creation, in IISs.

Most research on signaling has focused on its pre-purchase effects. Although researchers have argued that signaling could affect future purchase decisions, how signaling influences repurchase intention has not been detailed. This study proposes a model of the influence based on the signaling theory and expectation-confirmation model. The model posits that a signal influences an online shopper's expectation and the expectation-confirmation subsequently determines repurchase intention. The model was tested with pre-purchase and post-purchase data collected in a two-stage survey and analyzed with structural equation modeling. Findings indicate that signaling goes beyond the pre-purchase stage of initial purchase to influence repurchase intention. This indicates that signaling has longer-term effect than that typically examined in signaling research and further research on the effect is needed.

Indeed, organizations are investing in retaining skilled workers, in particular senior workers whose knowledge and experience are a valuable asset that should be passed to younger co-workers. One way to address these concerns is to create conditions to promote a feeling of employee's wellness in their work environment.

The deployment of a gift-giving service within a social networking site provides a unique opportunity to study the intersection of technological innovations and social norms and its potential to generate new revenue for ecommerce sites. Using Facebook Gifts as a real-world context for the study, we explore the factor structure of salient user beliefs influencing usage intention, and examine the relationships between beliefs and intention to use the service in a broader nomological network. Instead of adopting constructs from existing models, we started with the elicitation of salient beliefs and proceeded with successive stages of refinement to develop a suitable model. The empirical results show countervailing effects of perceived social utility and perceived convenience of the service on one hand, and low perceived value and privacy concerns on the other. A notable finding is the potential conflict arising between the expectations of effort associated with the procurement of a gift and the common perception of technology as reducing the required effort. The net result is that a technology-mediated gift service in the context of a social networking site runs counter to the social norms associated with traditional gift exchanges. This insight provides evidence of the dual challenge for social commerce initiatives. In order to be successful, new services in this area must leverage the potential of the technology as well as social practices. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Gift exchanges; Privacy concerns; Social commerce; Social network sites; Technology adoption"

Two types of OCSEs were developed: indirect social experiences (IDSEs) and virtual social experiences (VSEs). Two studies were conducted, in which 447 college students were enrolled. Study 1 compared the effects of OCSEs and non-OCSEs when online shopping post-payment dissonance occurred. The results indicate that providing consumers affected by online shopping post-payment dissonance with OCSEs reduces dissonance and produces higher satisfaction, higher repurchase intention, and lower complaint intention than when no OCSEs are provided. In addition, consumers’ interpersonal trust (IPT) and susceptibility to interpersonal informational influence (SIII) moderated the positive effects of OCSEs. Study 2 compared the effects of IDSEs and VSEs when online shopping post-payment dissonance occurred. The results suggest that the effects of IDSEs and VSEs on satisfaction, repurchase intention, and complaint intention are moderated by consumers’ computing need for control (CNC) and computer-mediated communication apprehension (CMCA). The consumers with high CNC and low CMCA preferred VSEs, whereas the consumers with low CNC and high CMCA preferred IDSEs. The effects of VSEs and IDSEs on consumers with high CNC and CMCA and those with low CNC and CMCA were not significantly different. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Computer-mediated communication apprehension; Computing need for control; Interpersonal trust; Online consumer social experiences; Online shopping post-payment dissonance; Susceptibility to interpersonal informational influence"

We discover that financial factors are better predictors than ICTs on service industry performance. Access to loans and lines of credit was the strongest predictor. It is often assumed that websites expand markets and increase revenues, but we found that they negatively affect sales revenue growth in Africa and Eastern Europe.

Information search and retrieval can be conducted by mobile agents in a decentralized system. As compared with the client/server model, the mobile agent approach has an advantage of saving network bandwidth and offering flexibility in information search and retrieval. In this paper, we present a model for mobile agents to select the most reputable information host to search and retrieve information. We use opinion-based belief structure to represent, aggregate and calculate the reputation of an information host. Since reputation is a multi-faced concept, our approach first allows the users to rank each information host's quality of service based on a set of evaluation categories. Then, a comprehensive, final reputation of the host is obtained by aggregating those specific category reputations. To recognize the subjective nature of a reputation, the transferable belief model is used to represent and rank the category reputation.

Without effectively addressing this problem, businesses will not be able to seize valuable opportunities to enlarge their customers’ base or optimize their social commerce decisions. This study argues that one way to deal with this important issue is through viewing social commerce as a series of engagement events facilitated by quality-augmented socialization process. More specifically, it proposes and empirically examines a new model that connects social commerce quality (perceptive and unperceptive) and social support quality to four interaction events of social commerce, namely initial attention, interaction experience, intuitive evaluation, and intention to buy. The findings of a PLS-SEM modeling of responses collected from a sample of active social media users reveal at least three worth noting findings. First, the present study confirmed that the social commerce process followed a causal path linking an individual consumer's initial attention to interaction experience to intuitive evaluation to intention to buy a product/service. Second, Social support quality was found to significantly influence only a consumer's initial attention, intuitive evaluation, and intention to buy. Third, social commerce quality (both unperceptive and perceptive) was found to significantly influence only a consumer's interaction experience and intention to buy.

By building on the judgment-bias literature and psychometric language-style analysis, we find several key results that can ultimately contribute to more effective information management for marketing decisions. Managers tend to better interpret negative reviews when consumers use more cognitive language markers in the form of insight and discrepancy words and more third-person pronouns (i.e., undefined social referents) in their reviews. The inverse relationship exists for the use of causality words and future tenses (i.e., behavioral intentions), as managers tend to underestimate the gravity of the situation under these conditions. Expressions of positive and negative emotions in reviews do not significantly affect managers’ readings of negative reviews. Furthermore, more experienced managers and female managers are better at identifying negative reviews, and longer consumer reviews make it more difficult for managers to correctly identify negative reviews. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Information management; Judgment bias; Language-style analysis; Online consumer review; Post-launch product feedback"

So far, little if any research has conceptualized and measured this kind of content quality in the context of social media. Therefore, this study proposes and empirically examines a new construct, compatible quality of social media content, which adds to knowledge by expanding prior online content quality research beyond the traditional focus on non-fit quality beliefs. The results of structural equation modeling of responses collected from a sample of active social media users reveal at least three worth noting findings. First, the study confirmed the multidimensionality of compatible quality of social media content, which encompasses reflective, stimulated, practiced, and advocated components. Second, there was equivalence in the measurements of the studied constructs and the structural weights of the proposed network of relationships across the different gender and experience subgroups. Third, compatible quality of social media content was found to influence continued interest, active confidence, and feedback openness. The practical and research implications of these results are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Active confidence; Affordances; Compatible quality; Continued interest; Feedback openness; Fit measurement; Social media content"

Some others have investigated knowledge management among open-source-software (OSS) developers and discussed factors influencing knowledge transfer within development teams (e.g. Joshi and Sarker, 2006). In the domain of open source software (OSS) communities, more companies are now attempting to establish relationships to benefit from these potential value-creating communities; and project managers could in fact target different goals within software development teams including knowledge transfer within and between teams. We step forward to distinguish knowledge transfer within groups as opposed to knowledge transfer between groups; where relevant projects are bundled into separate strongly intra-connected groups. In knowledge management literature there is a trade-off between sparse network structures (Burt, 2000, 2002) versus dense network structures (Walker et al., 1997; Coleman, 1988). It is argued that the former facilitates the diffusion and generation of ideas among groups, while the latter affects the implementation of idea within each dense group. To our best knowledge, there has been no study to investigate the relationship between dense and sparse network structures. We propose that knowledge transfer within dense groups has a positive influence on knowledge transfer between sparse groups, in that intragroup density, group size, developers centrality and betweenness could impact intergroup coupling. To prove our hypothesis, we use a complex network of open source software (OSS) as the domain of interest, where developers represent nodes and two developers contributing to a project task represent a network tie. Developers contributing to tasks in groups other than their own can explore novel ideas via sharing knowledge, whereas developers contributing to tasks inside groups exploit ideas to improve those projects. We investigate the idea both analytically and empirically within 4 months, 8 months and 1 year lagged time, and finally show that intragroup density has a positive whereas developers’ centrality has a negative influence on intergroup coupling. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Intergroup coupling; Intergroup diffusion of innovation; Intragroup density; Knowledge transfer; Open source software network"

Managers are a powerful source of influence shaping the post-adoption attitudes and behaviors of users and the success of ES. However, the extant IS literature has focused primarily on the role of top management and theoretical explanations of the role of supervisors in fostering continuing usage of ES are lacking. Drawing on transformational leadership theory and the IS continuance (ISC) model, this paper conceptualizes a theoretical model differentiating the influence mechanisms through which different types of leadership behaviors influence the success of ES. Data collected from 192 users of ES confirms our theorization. We find that transformational leadership behaviors of supervisors influence users’ evaluations of satisfaction and perceived usefulness, while their transactional leadership behaviors influence users’ ES continuance intention by moderating the effects of user satisfaction and perceived usefulness on ES continuance intention. This study advances research on the role of leadership behaviors of supervisors in capturing value from enterprise systems. The research also contributes to practice by suggesting effective strategies for promoting continued usage of mission critical systems such as enterprise systems and delivering value from firms’ IT investments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Enterprise systems; IS continuance; Leadership; Strategic information systems; Supervisors; System usage"

The four strategically selected team cases include eight global knowledge-intensive industrial oil service companies in Norway. The methodology included 24 in-depth interviews done in 2016. The study finds that formal intellectual property rights are key to building up and keeping trust in the team and also for building up the right attitudes within the team. The IPRs increased the innovativeness in the team and incremental innovations. The IPRs fostered a unique knowledge sharing in these four teams enabling them to work towards innovative solutions and delivering in time. Formal IPŔs foster informal trust and expertise sharing and by that also the inter- organizational cooperation. The confidence and knowledge sharing strengthen the possibility for future collaboration and innovations both on an individual level and on a corporate level. The theoretical implication of our findings is that IPRs increase the trust, commitment, and attitudes within the team providing knowledge sharing and innovativeness for improved solutions and results. IPRs are positive for collaboration, and they are complementary governance mechanisms. The practical implication is that IPRs must be defined and accepted before the corporations start up the inter-organizational teamwork.

However, few studies have investigated the roles of social commerce factors on customers’ purchase decision-making. Based on the social learning theory, we develop a research model to examine how customers’ learning behavior along three main social commerce components (SCCs) affects customers’ attitude in both cognitive and affective dimensions and how such attitude determines customers’ purchase intention. The results from a survey of 243 actual users of social commerce websites suggest that cognitive and affective appraisals are the main predictors of purchase intention, with cognitive appraisal having a higher predictive power than affective appraisal. In addition, learning from forums and communities and learning from ratings and reviews have significant influences on both cognitive and affective appraisals, while learning from forums and communities plays a more important role in formulating affective appraisal and learning from ratings and reviews plays a more important role in determining cognitive appraisal. Contrary to our expectation, learning from social recommendations has no significant influence on either cognitive or affective appraisal. In summary, these findings provide a comprehensive understanding about customers’ purchase decision-making process and extend the application scope of social learning theory. The findings also provide social commerce managers guidance in designing more effective websites and allocating resources and efforts reasonably on different SCCs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Forums and communities; Ratings and reviews; Social commerce components; Social learning theory; Social recommendations"

Using a UTAUTv2 model, we explore the effect of process- and content-oriented knowledge on behavioral intentions to use e-government services. The adoption of e-government systems is lower than desired in general and faces considerable resistance in many developing countries. Scholars suggest that more knowledge and better training are critical to increasing adoption and usage rates. We conducted a survey of 262 citizens in Lebanon to investigate how consumers cope with high and moderate levels of complexity during their initial learning experience with a technology-based product. The results show that a moderate degree of content- and process-oriented knowledge about e-government services during an initial learning experience improves usage habits, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions. The challenge for service providers is to understand consumers’ learning experience and coping strategies and to provide mechanisms that make the transition to e-services easier and more intuitive. This can be achieved by developing new infrastructure for e-services to facilitate easier access to e-government websites and to improve site performance. Marketers can also develop more effective communications that offer easy and flexible specific steps for using the portal. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","E-government; E-services; Initial learning experience; Knowledge; Lebanon; UTAUTv2"

However, outsourcing management with a public provider results in a lack of control over digital products, which could produce incidents such as data unavailability during service outages, violations of confidentiality and/or legal issues. This paper presents a novel distribution model of digital products inspired by lean supply chain principles called CloudChain, which has been designed to support the information management during digital product lifecycle. This model enables connected networks of customers, partners and organizations to conduct the stages of digital product lifecycle as value chains. Virtual distribution channels are created over cloud resources for applications of organizations to deliver digital products to applications of partners through a seamless information flow. A configurable packing and logistic service was developed to ensure confidentiality and privacy in the product delivery by using encrypted packs. A chain management architecture enables organizations to keep tighter control over their value chains, distribution channels and digital products. CloudChain software instances were integrated to an information management system of a space agency. In an experimental evaluation CloudChain prototype was evaluated in a private cloud where the feasibility of applying supply chain principles to the delivery of digital products in terms of efficiency, flexibility and security was revealed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cloud storage; Content delivery; Digital product logistics; Information goods; Security; Supply chain management"

The paper analyses the mechanisms available to Spain's public administrations for managing these irregularities in records management though the raft of regulations and protocols that have been approved in the country. It assesses how the lack of specific regulations providing for transparency by design currently represents a limitation on the role of records management as a tool for preventing and fighting corruption. The paper shows that there is a need to guarantee proper records management, which includes transparency throughout a record's lifecycle. It concludes that legislation assessed does not properly reflect these ideals. Nevertheless, this concern is only partially and insufficiently reflected in legislation.

A bidirectional research model is presented based on trust and perceived risk as antecedents to the intent to install a mobile application. Data is collected from a survey of 214 participants and is analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results suggest that institutional loyalty plays a significant role in consumers’ intent to install mobile apps. Trust and its antecedent, security, had strong significant positive relationships with the intention to install mobile apps, while risk and its antecedent, privacy, had weak and insignificant relationships. The bidirectional model's relationship between trust and risk was also insignificant in both directions, further suggesting that perception of risk is an insignificant factor in the intent to install mobile apps. © 2017","Information security; Institutionalized trust; Intent to install; Mobile app installation; Mobile device security"

We present a model of organizational open platform adoption that integrates six different theoretical mechanisms based on a technology-organization-environment framework that drives herding: network effect benefits, new platform benefits, new platform risk, organizational learning, mimetic pressures, and competitive pressures. To find which mechanisms work significantly in organizational IT decision-making in accordance with IT diffusion and rival precedence, we empirically test the model by splitting the samples according to the proportion of rivals that have already adopted innovations. The empirical results demonstrate that among the six herding mechanisms, new platform risk and organizational learning drives herding in the earlier stage of diffusion and new platform benefits and competitive pressure drives herding in the later stage of diffusion. The results imply that organizations react conservatively to new platforms when they perceive less platform diffusion. However, as diffusion increases, organizations react more strategically to maintain competitive parity with rivals by imitating rival decisions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Competitive pressure; IT platform adoption; IT platform decision; Mimetic pressure; Network effect; Organizational learning; Rival precedence"

At the same time, it will be presented as an innovative solution allowing the holder of a secret shadow to be identified based on their characteristic biometrics and their semantic features. Cognitive cryptography is used to manage strategic information. By using techniques for splitting and sharing this type of data as well as utilising individual biometric traits in the entire process of distributing all shadows of the concealed and split information makes the proposed cognitive cryptography techniques an innovative, extremely useful tool for securing data of major importance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cognitive cryptography; Data sharing; Intelligent information management; Semantic and personal information"

Little is known about how organizations support PKR, and how PKR facilitates the flow of information and knowledge. This paper examines how different information management professionals access and use PKR. It is a multiple case study, with 43 semi-structured interviews and an analysis of strategic documents. The purpose is to shed light on strategic intentions with PKR, its collaborative tasks and qualities. A conceptual model was built for this purpose. The aim is to better understand how PKR works and to examine how information on education, training and the skills of employees is managed in organizations. The findings demonstrate that organizational strategies portray elaborate intentions regarding knowledge seeking and sharing, while less emphasis is put on knowledge registration or management. Interviewees expressed lack of appropriate actions to support PKR. Access and use of PKR is limited and the organizations still struggle to manage the PKR of their employees. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Collaboration; Information management; Knowledge management; Personal knowledge registration (PKR); Training strategies"

The goal of this research is to analyze the characteristics of the general public's opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise and obesity (DDEO) as expressed on Twitter. A multi-component semantic and linguistic framework was developed to collect Twitter data, discover topics of interest about DDEO, and analyze the topics. From the extracted 4.5 million tweets, 8% of tweets discussed diabetes, 23.7% diet, 16.6% exercise, and 51.7% obesity. The strongest correlation among the topics was determined between exercise and obesity (p <.0002). Other notable correlations were: diabetes and obesity (p <.0005), and diet and obesity (p <.001). DDEO terms were also identified as subtopics of each of the DDEO topics. The frequent subtopics discussed along with “Diabetes”, excluding the DDEO terms themselves, were blood pressure, heart attack, yoga, and Alzheimer. The non-DDEO subtopics for “Diet” included vegetarian, pregnancy, celebrities, weight loss, religious, and mental health, while subtopics for “Exercise” included computer games, brain, fitness, and daily plan. Non-DDEO subtopics for “Obesity” included Alzheimer, cancer, and children.

This study proposes a research framework, based on the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) model, to explore how and to what extent two types of app attributes (i.e., app design and app performance attributes) stimulate travel apps engagement. Based on a user acceptance testing (UAT testing) of a real travel app development project, the study uses survey data from 804 tourists to validate the proposed research model. The results reveal different effectiveness of app design and app performance attributes, and demonstrate that two app design features (i.e., user interface attractiveness and privacy/security) and three app performance attributes (i.e., compatibility, ease of use, and relative advantages) are important drivers of users’ behavioral engagement of mobile travel apps. Further, psychological engagement and three types of benefit perception (i.e., hedonic benefit, utilitarian benefit, and social benefit) serially mediate the relationships.

A growing share of the content in social media is visual − including Photos − which users can share by tagging. To improve the understanding of the determinants of social media users’ behavioral intention to share content, this study investigates why people tag photos on SNS. A comprehensive research model was developed based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). The validity of the extended UTAUT2 model was tested on a new form of technology use which is not only timely but is much desired by the scholars engaged in information systems research. The research model investigates the role of habit, hedonic motivation, facilitating conditions, social influence, effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social presence, social status, and self-efficacy in influencing the user intentions to engage in photo-tagging. The research model was tested using a cross-sectional study of 780 adolescent Facebook users. The findings suggest that only habit and hedonic motivation have a significant direct influence on the user's intentions to tag photos.

From a survey of 528 consumers, we ran two structural equation models: model #1 is a base model of direct effects of attitudes and satisfaction on continuance intention; model #2 adds habit as a mediator variable. We show that consumer attitudes are stronger predictors of continuance intention, without mediation effects from habit. Consumer satisfaction only weakly predicts continuance intention and is mediated by habit. While satisfaction is correlated with consumer attitude, and satisfaction is correlated with habit, consumer attitudes seem unrelated to any habits. Attitude seems to be the strongest determinant of continuance intention; second, in the absence of compelling rational data, or given beliefs that competitors are largely undifferentiated, consumers might continue using the same product. Such complex interactions between variables may not be adequately captured in a straightforward variance model, however this study extends research in habit and continuance intention and provides for future research exploring the importance of habit over satisfaction and predominance of consumer attitudes in predicting continuance intention. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Attitude; Continuance intention; Emotions; Habit; Mobile applications; Satisfaction"

Organizations are expected to implement appropriate practices to address knowledge-sharing challenges in GSD. With the growing literature on GSD and its widespread adoption, it is important to build a body of knowledge to support future research and effective knowledge sharing practices. Objective We aimed at systematically identifying and synthesizing knowledge sharing challenges and practices. We also intended to classify the recurrent challenges and most frequently reported practices in different contextual settings. Method We used Systematic Literature Review (SLR) for reviewing 61 primary studies that were selected after searching the GSD literature published over the last 14 years (2000–September 2014). We applied thematic analysis method for analysing the data extracted from the reviewed primary studies. Results Our findings revealed that knowledge sharing challenges and practices in GSD could be classified in 6 main themes: management, team structure, work processes/practices, team cognition, social attributes and technology. In regard to contextual settings, we found empirical studies were mainly conducted in an offshore outsourcing collaboration model distributed between two sites. Most of the studied organizations were large enterprises. Many of the studies did not report any information for several contextual attributes that made it difficult to analyse the reported challenges and practices with respect to their respective contexts. Conclusion We can conclude: (a) there is a higher tendency among researchers to report practices than challenges of knowledge sharing in GSD. (b) Given our analysis, most of the reported knowledge sharing challenges and practices fall under the theme of “work practices”. (c) The technology related knowledge-sharing challenges are the least reported; we discussed the available technologies for supporting knowledge sharing needs in GSD. (d) The organizational contextual information is missing from a large number of studies; hence, it was not possible to investigate the potential relations between knowledge sharing challenges/practices and the contextual attributes of GSD teams. We assert the need of exploring knowledge sharing in the context of small/medium sized organizations to avoid the risk of findings being biased by specific empirical setting (e.g., large enterprises distributed between US and India). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Empirical software engineering; Global software development (GSD); Knowledge management (KM); Knowledge sharing; Systematic literature review (SLR)"

Data quality has been studied extensively over many decades and many approaches to data quality management have been proposed. However, these approaches are typically based on datasets internal to organizations, with known metadata, and domain knowledge of the data semantics. Open data, on the other hand, are often unfamiliar to the user and may lack metadata. The aim of this research note is to outline the challenges in dealing with data quality of open datasets, and to set an agenda for future research to address this risk to deriving value from open data investments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Data quality; Open data"

In virtual health communities (VHCs), the members often share their personal health information (PHI) with other members. These information exchanges provide benefits to both the information providers as well as the recipients. The PHI disclosure, however, may entail privacy concerns. Our study used the privacy calculus model to examine the trade-off between individuals' expected benefits and privacy concerns when disclosing PHI in social media environments. Our results showed that age, health status, and affective commitment influence the balance between the information disclosure drivers and barriers in the privacy calculus model. More specifically, we found that among members of VHCs, healthier people expect to receive fewer personal benefits of communicating PHI in social media environments. Moreover, individuals who are emotionally attached to online communities expect to both receive and provide more benefits while communicating PHI in those communities. We also observed that individuals who are familiar with but not members of VHCs, especially those who are young and healthy, are more concerned about their PHI privacy in online communities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing on the literature of privacy calculus theory, this research examined the factors that influence the trade-off decision of receiving perceived benefits and being penalized with perceived risks through the calculus lens. In particular, two paths of the direct effects on perceived benefits and risks that induce the ultimate intention to disclose personal information via mobile apps were proposed and empirically tested. The analysis showed that self-presentation and personalized services positively influence consumers’ perceived benefits, which in turn positively affects the intention to disclose personal information. Perceived severity and perceived control serve as the direct antecedents of perceived risks that negatively affect the intention of consumers to disclose personal information. Compared with the perceived risks, the perceived benefits more strongly influence the intention to disclose personal information. This study extends the literature on privacy concerns to consumer intention to disclose personal information by theoretically developing and empirically testing four hypotheses in a research model.

While focusing on visitors’ museum experience, new display methods employ a variety of digital technologies to provide exhibition content in ways that allow visitors to better understand artifacts on display. However, the majority of such methods rely on one-way means of delivering information. The lack of interaction with visitors and the use of lighting that clearly separates real and virtual spaces have made museums inadequate as experiential spaces. To resolve those problems, this article suggests a plan to deploy content services for visitors’ museum experiences by combining beacons and HMDs. This study establishes the concept of a service, which provides a virtual world experience by connecting a beacon installed in real space, that is, an exhibition room, to an HMD (head-mounted display). Furthermore, the service also incorporates a storytelling feature to diversify user experience by presenting the characteristics of and stories about artifacts. The service design will make both online and on-site museum experiences meaningful. Ultimately, this article presents the exhibition content thus created as Metaverse exhibition content made through an effective combination of augmented reality and a virtual world. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Augmented reality; Beacon; Exhibition content; HMD; Metaverse; Museum; Virtual reality"

However, the successful implementation of Mobile banking largely depends on the extent of how much customers are fully motivated to adopt it. In fact, over the Jordanian context, the adoption rate of mobile banking is very low and quite few studies that have examined the related issues of mobile banking. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the factors influencing behavioural intention and adoption of Mobile banking by customers of Jordanian banks. The proposed model has assimilated factors from the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) along with trust. Data was collected by conducting a field survey questionnaire completed by 343 participants. The results mainly showed that behavioural intention is significantly and positively influenced by performance expectancy, effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, price value and trust.

The most obvious finding from this study is that we can develop social interaction building up trust and share knowledge through online technology platforms without offline social interaction. The design and methodology are case studies of four Scandinavian virtual global project teams with a total of 42 team members. The survey is a longitude study in 2014-16 based upon 168 individual reports and 16 in-depth top leader interviews. Working smarter means using technology platforms for developing trust and knowledge collaboration to deliver business solutions and innovations. Working smarter mean to work in a global project team where the collaboration results develop the team into a high-performance team. Working more intelligent is sharing knowledge to improve innovation and collective and individual competence growth. Understanding that investment in top technology solutions are inexpensive compared to the results delivered by professional human resources. Working greener means to let the team members be aware of green solutions and innovations. Working greener means to travel less using the possibilities given by social technology platforms. The four teams reduced the number of trips by 50–70%.

In order to fill this gap, this article uses panel data from 2004 to 2012 on a sample of 240 small and medium-sized hotels for which we have collected data on profitability and 50,115 user-generated reviews on TripAdvisor, one of the most popular and largest online community for travellers. The results from fixed effects regression models show that online ratings from user-generated reviews on TripAdvisor have a positive effect on hotel revenue growth that is outweighed by a negative effect on gross profit margins. Thus, the increasing importance of user-generated reviews in online communities for travellers is shifting hotel competition from unit profit margin to volumes and to higher room occupancy rates, with online retailers capturing most of the value created in online transactions through social media features and with a limited effect brought on net profitability. However, hotels with higher star-rating, with a lower degree of local competition and localized outside popular destinations were found to obtain more benefits from online visibility on their gross and net profitability. Based on these results, managerial implications discuss how hotels should use social media features according to a strategic view based on pursuing the horizontal and vertical differentiation of their services in an attempt to create more economic value from their online visibility and to protect profit margins from the intermediation in their customer relationships. © 2016 The Authors","Local competition; Localization outside popular destinations; Market positioning; Online visibility; Reviews; Small and medium hotels; Social media; Star-rating; Value creation"

In some instances, systems relying on biometric technology for access control have not been well received by employees. One potential reason for resistance may be perceived privacy issues associated with organizational collection and use of biometric data. This research draws on previous organizational information handling and procedural fairness literature to frame and examine these underlying privacy issues. Perceived accountability, perceived vulnerability, and distrust were distilled from the previous literature as the primary dimensions of employee privacy concerns related to biometric technology. This study assesses the effects of these privacy concerns, how they vary based on the cultural influences of Anglos and Hispanics. Fire ground accountability is a critical management objective in the firefighting domain. In multi-unit or multi-agency crisis response scenarios, the on-scene incident commander tracks and accounts for each first responder. This research designed and deployed a new fire ground accountability system that tracked firefighters through finger pattern-based biometric logins to their assigned positions on the firefighting apparatus. An instrument measuring level of privacy concern on three underlying dimensions and demographic data was developed, validated and administered in a quasi-experimental field study. A pre-test-post-test survey methodology was employed to detect potential differences in privacy concerns as familiarity with the system increased. The study shows that Anglo and Hispanic subjects frame privacy issues differently associated with use of biometric technology in a fire ground accountability system. Finally, the study showed that some privacy concerns such as distrust and perceived vulnerability can be alleviated through system use with changes in post-use privacy concerns moderated by ethnic affiliation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, as a critical factor to enhance relational performance, the inter-firm IT governance strategy has not been sufficiently studied. Based on the contractual and relational governance literature, this paper presents two inter-firm IT governance strategies, namely, balancing (focusing on achieving a close match between the relational and contractual governance) and complementing (focusing on creating synergy between the relational and contractual governance) governance strategies. Using data collected from 200 firms, we examined the relationship between these two governance strategies and relational performance. Furthermore, we studied the influence of a contingent factor, IT ambidexterity (simultaneous pursuit of IT flexibility and IT standardization) on this value generation process. Our results indicate that both inter-firm IT governance strategies, but especially the balancing strategy, can help increase relational performance, and IT ambidexterity also can influence the choice of governance strategies of focal firms. Specifically, focal firms with low IT ambidexterity prefer using a balancing governance strategy rather than a complementing governance strategy. On the other hand, focal firms with high IT ambidexterity can reduce or mitigate the risks of unbalancing strategy (such as the contractual-dominant or relational-dominant governance strategy), and then enhance the synergy effects of contractual and relational governance. Implications for theory and practice are also discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Balancing; Complementing; Inter-firm IT governance; IT ambidexterity; Relational performance"

The CLR automates some of the analysis of research articles with analyses of impact (citations), structure (co-authorship networks) and content (topic modeling of abstracts). A contribution of the paper is to demonstrate how the content of abstracts can be analyzed automatically to provide a set of research topics within a literature corpus. The CLR software can be used to support three use cases: (1) analysis of the literature for a research area, (2) analysis and ranking of journals, and (3) analysis and ranking of individual scholars and research teams. The working of the CLR software is illustrated through application to the technology acceptance model (TAM) using a set of 3,386 articles.

To do this, we first crawl the massive travel blogs for a targeted city online. Then, we transfer the textual contents of these blogs to a series of word vectors to form the initial data source. Next, we implement the frequent pattern mining method on the data to identify the city's popular locations by their sequenced co-occurrences among the usual tourism activities, which can be visualized into a word network. Finally, we develop a max-confidence based method to detect travel routes from the network. We illustrate the benefits of this approach by applying it to the data from a blog web-site run by a Chinese online tourism service company. The results show that the proposed method can efficiently explore the popular travel information from massive data. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Blog mining; Geographic term; Tourist location; Travel route; Word network"

Through three empirical studies, the research suggests that users express some preference for dialogic conversations, and young users have a higher tendency than senior users to consider dialogic conversations more informative than the dialectic alternative.

Understanding MHB users’ loyalty intentions toward this technology has become equally important for MHB service providers, as it is essential for them to retain their customers. However, existing literature in the context of mobile booking has mainly focused on the adoption and acceptance of this technology. The purpose of this paper is to empirically test a research model that incorporates antecedents of mobile shopping loyalty in a hotel booking context. The proposed model was tested through structural equation modeling (SEM) by using empirical data collected from 396 MHB users. Study results revealed that convenience, compatibility, and perceived ease of use (PEOU) had a significant impact on the users’ loyalty intentions toward MHB technology. In addition, compatibility significantly influenced PEOU and convenience and PEOU had a significant impact on loyalty and convenience.

There have been huge challenges of controlling access to ubiquitous resources among collaborative multi-servers based on the negotiating security policies on URMs. However, the traditional access control mechanisms were insufficient to meet the requirements of role assignment management for URMs that allow accessing services via huge clients. Therefore, Ubiquitous RBAC (Role-based Access Control) with CBR (case-based reasoning) based negotiation technique is proposed in this paper. The novel RBAC scheme could efficiently manage not only one ubiquitous server, but also multiple ubiquitous servers on the cooperation domain through supporting both negotiating role assignment (NRA) task and cooperative role assignment (CRA) task in URM-platform by using a spiral negotiating process. Furthermore, it solves the difficulties in reducing the costs of ubiquitous computing resources, e.g., the role reassigned rate, handover rate, bandwidth, and power consumption, etc. Due to the ease of use and its efficiency in negotiating and managing the user-to-role as well as virtual role assignment by applying CBR approach, it is a highly powerful strategy of information management for conducting the innovative research and design for ubiquitous RBAC scheme. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Case-based reasoning management; Information management; Negotiation-based RBAC; RBAC; Role assignment management; Ubiquitous RBAC"

This paper contributes to the nascent literature on companies' social media service failure apologies and fills a gap in the social commerce literature by recognising that due to the open and public nature of social media, these apologies may reach not just affected customers, but also unintended audiences such as potential customers among the general public, which could potentially damage a company's reputation and market share. An online survey administered to 241 customers and 271 non-customers of a famous mobile phone brand, which used YouTube to apologise to its customers for a service failure incident, is used to explore potential behavioural outcomes, after exposure to the apology. Findings confirm that both customers and non-customers of the service provider may become exposed to a social media service failure apology. The hypothesised model predicts behavioural intentions to remain a customer after exposure to the social media service apology better than behavioural intentions to become a customer, even though relationships hold for both groups.

Through an experiment with 809 Twitter users, the study finds that social presence is formed through machine interactivity, person interactivity, and self-disclosure; that greater social presence increases users' perception of the usefulness of information and their trust in the company; and that increases in those utilitarian values contribute to SNS users' positive engagement in relationships with corporate SNS accounts. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Shorter product life cycles lead to increased complexity in areas such as product and process design, factory deployment and production operations. To handle this complexity, new knowledge-based methods and technologies are needed to model, simulate, optimize and monitor manufacturing systems. Product lifecycle management research tends to focus on situations that are responsive to formal analysis and modelling. However, in several domains such as knowledge intensive collaborative environments, it's not possible to model processes using formal notations. Knowledge based and collaborative process management involves a combination of structured and non-structured processes. Structured processes management can be reduced to a set of fully-defined rules leading to high efficiency but also low flexibility, whereas the management of non-structured processes is not prone to a full formalization. A combination of both structured and unstructured management approaches is required in order to achieve a successful trade-off between efficiency, flexibility and controllability. We call a process as semi-structured when it contains both structured and non-structured sub-processes leading to a flexible and efficient hybrid approach. Large enterprise information systems, impose structured and predictable workflows, while knowledge based collaborative processes are unpredictable to some extent, involving high amount of human-decision. Moreover, large enterprise information systems are not able to manage the daily ad hoc communication inherent to the knowledge-based process itself.

However, focusing on multiple UML diagrams is a main cause of breaching the consistency problem, which ultimately reduces the overall software model's quality. Consistency management techniques are widely used to ensure the model consistency by correct model-to-model and model-to-code transformation. Consistency management becomes a promising area of research especially for model-driven architecture. In this paper, we extensively review UML consistency management techniques. The proposed techniques have been classified based on the parameters identified from the research literature. Moreover, we performed a qualitative comparison of consistency management techniques in order to identify current research trends, challenges and research gaps in this field of study. Based on the results, we concluded that researchers have not provided more attention on exploring inter-model and semantic consistency problems. Furthermore, state-of-the-art consistency management techniques mostly focus only on three UML diagrams (i.e., class, sequence and state chart) and the remaining UML diagrams have been overlooked.

However, service developers have faced a dilemma of balancing between making the service as high quality as possible but at the same time creating demand for the premium products that augment the core free service. If the service is of enough high quality, augmenting premium products might not offer significant added value over the otherwise free service. In this study we investigate how perceived service quality predicts customers’ willingness to continue using the freemium services and to purchase premium content. User responses were gathered from freemium services (free-to-play games) (N = 869). The results indicate that while expectedly the different dimensions of service quality (assurance, empathy, reliability and responsiveness) positively predict the intentions to continue using the freemium service, they do directly predict why people would be willing to spend more money on premium, i.e. the effect of perceived quality of a freemium service on premium purchases is mediated by use of freemium. These findings indicate that increasing the quality of a freemium service has surprisingly little effect on the demand for additional premium services directly. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Free-to-play; Freemium; Online games; Premium; Purchase behavior; Service quality; Servqual"

Online retailers also expect to profit from impulse buying. It is therefore interesting and beneficial to investigate the design elements of online stores and the sales promotion stimuli that e-retailers can use to either arouse consumers' desire or decrease their self-control to evoke their purchase impulses. This study seeks to explicitly identify the factors associated with online store design and sales promotion stimuli that most affect online impulse buying behavior throughout the consumer decision-making process. Drawing on the two-factor theory, it successfully identifies the hygiene and motivation factors that trigger online impulse buying. The questionnaire responses of 239 valid respondents revealed that most of the hygiene factors are associated with the design of online stores, and all of the motivation factors are forms of sales promotion stimuli that effectively facilitate online impulse buying and present utilitarian or hedonic benefits to consumers. This study also identifies the most effective sales promotion stimuli and offers a comprehensive checklist for Web designers. Moreover, the distribution of motivation and hygiene factors for each stage of the EKB model is uneven, and some stages include only hygiene factors. The findings of this study demonstrate that the triggers of consumers' online shopping behavior do not always apply to online impulse buying, and have important implications for impulse buying research and practice. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This present study addresses three hidden assumptions prevalent in online review studies: (1) all reviews are visible equally to online users, (2) review rating (RR) and hotel star class (HSC) affect review helpfulness individually with no interaction, and (3) characteristics of reviews and reviewer status stay constant. Four categories of input variables were considered in the present study: review content, sentiment, author, and visibility. Our findings confirmed the interaction effect between HSC and RR. The data set was sub-divided into eight subsets as a result. Three review visibility indicators (including days since a review was posted, days since a review has remained on the home page, and number of reviews with the same rating at the time a review was written) had a varying and strong effect on review helpfulness. The model performance was greatly improved after taking account of review visibility features, the interaction effect of HSC and RR, and a more accurate measurement of variables. Model tree (M5P) outperformed linear regression and support vector regression as it better modeled the interaction effect. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this paper is to determine the key factors that influence consumers’ adoption of mobile commerce. The extended model incorporates basic TAM predictors, such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, but also several external variables, such as trust, mobility, customization and customer involvement. Data was collected from 224 m-commerce consumers. First, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to determine which variables had significant influence on m-commerce adoption. In a second phase, the neural network model was used to rank the relative influence of significant predictors obtained from SEM. The results showed that customization and customer involvement are the strongest antecedents of the intention to use m-commerce. The study results will be useful for m-commerce providers in formulating optimal marketing strategies to attract new consumers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Behavioral intention; m-Commerce; m-Service; Neural network; Technology adoption"

Prior research regards social capital as an important determinant of an individual's behavior. However, current knowledge on how social capital is built in the Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) e-commerce context is incomplete. Drawing on signaling theory and social capital theory, this study proposes a model to investigate how sellers’ website quality (i.e., information quality, system quality and service quality) affects the development of social capital between buyers and sellers, which in turn improves buyers’ loyalty in the C2C online shopping context. Data collected from 307 buyers on TaoBao, China's largest C2C online shopping platform, was used to empirically test the research model. The results indicate that not all of these three dimensions of website quality are positively related to cognitive and structural capital. Furthermore, although cognitive and relational capital are positively related to buyers’ loyalty, structural capital is not associated with buyers’ loyalty. Our findings bridge the literature gap about the formation of social capital in the C2C e-commerce context by demonstrating how website quality dimensions exert different effects on cognitive and structural capital. For online sellers, the results suggest that they should strategically offer appropriate website quality dimensions to build social capital with buyers in order to maintain buyers’ loyalty. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Information quality; Loyalty; Service quality; Social capital; System quality"

By discussing the challenges and opportunities faced by Data.gov, we provide several lessons that can inform research and practice. We suggest that providing access to open data in itself does not spur innovation. Specifically, we claim that public agencies need to spend resources to improve the capacities of their organizations to move toward 'open data by default'; develop capacities of community to use data to solve problems; and think critically about the unintended consequences of providing access to public data.

This paper adopts a knowledge management perspective on ESN. Through a mixed methods approach we examine how employees use ESN and the value of these uses. With a qualitative content analysis we identify five uses of ESN, problem solving, ideas and work discussion, events and updates, task management, and informal talk. With a survey we further show how these uses drive value of ESN. The results demonstrate that generating and obtaining new ideas for work by participating in discussions and finding solutions for work-related problems are the key sources of value. The results further show that the socially and work-oriented ESN uses are closely intertwined. Hence, the informal discussions in ESN are a lubricant for more utilitarian uses that should not be crowded out from the platform. Finally, we theorize that a specific advantage of ESN over information repositories and discussion forums is how ESN enables users to meet their social and work-related goals simultaneously. Our study offers a granular view of ESN use and guidance for developing organizational ESN policies. © 2016","Enterprise 2.0; Enterprise social networking; Knowledge management; Mixed methods; Social media; Social software"

Going deeper, this study also takes course difficulty into consideration and investigates the interactive effects of course difficulty on the main factors identified above. The empirical results show that the vividness of course content, teacher subject knowledge, and MOOC interactivity can positively affect students’ intention to revisit MOOCs. However, the relationships between the three dimensional factors and student intention to revisit are affected in different ways by course difficulty. Specifically, the findings show that course difficulty negatively moderates the relationship between course content vividness and students’ intention to revisit, and positively moderates the relationship between teacher subject knowledge and students’ intention to revisit. In addition, course difficulty typically does not have a significant influence on the relationship between technology interactivity and students’ intention to revisit.

Based on the definition, this study surveyed 1369 peer-reviewed academic publications in the social media, Web 2.0, and other related areas. Following the survey, 418 of the publications were identified as social commerce research. Then, latent semantic analysis (LSA), a text mining approach, was applied to summarize the current state of social commerce research. LSA results show that there are three major research themes in the current social commerce research: organization, advertisement, and word-of-mouth. Each theme discusses topics such as innovation, user-generated content, and reputation, among others. In addition, we identify some interesting trends. The first main trend is that innovation, corporate reputation, and user-generated content remain the major research topics, although they are experiencing a slight decline.

Modern enterprises collect big data from various inbound and outbound data sources. The inbound data sources handle data generated from the results of business operations, such as manufacturing, supply chain management, marketing, and human resource management, among others. Outbound data sources handle customer-generated data which are acquired directly or indirectly from customers, market analysis, surveys, product reviews, and transactional histories. However, cloud service utilization costs increase because of big data analytics and value creation activities for enterprises and customers. This article presents a novel concept of big data reduction at the customer end in which early data reduction operations are performed to achieve multiple objectives, such as (a) lowering the service utilization cost, (b) enhancing the trust between customers and enterprises, (c) preserving privacy of customers, (d) enabling secure data sharing, and (e) delegating data sharing control to customers.

This study addresses that gap. The paper also introduces and applies a systematic methodology for conducting literature reviews that combines concept mapping, review scoping, and a structured search and analysis process. The resulting search in Scopus and Proquest and subsequent analysis of the recent literature (2011–2016) on IA and quality, evaluation, measurement, and maturity in the context of information management yielded the following findings and recommendations. IA research and practice could do well to: pursue contingency frameworks rather than seek universal standardization; investigate the relationship between IA and the dimensions of information quality and information management quality; undertake case studies that apply more foundational IA methodologies in full; develop theories of IA maturity and IA maturity modelling methods; recognize that measurement and evaluation of information management quality and information quality are necessary elements of the IA and should be explicitly incorporated into IA methodology. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Information audit; Information management; Information quality; Literature review methodology; Quality management"

Nevertheless, researchers have found that the actual application of analytics in companies is still in its initial stages. Therefore, this paper studies by means of a descriptive survey the application of analytics with regards to five different aspects as defined by the DELTA model: data, enterprise or organization, leadership, targets or techniques and applications, and the analysts who apply the techniques themselves. We found that the analytics organization in companies matures with regards to these aspects. As such, if companies started earlier with analytics, they apply nowadays more complex techniques such as neural networks, and more advanced applications such as HR analytics and predictive analytics. Moreover, analytics is differently propagated throughout companies as they mature with a larger focus on department-wide or organization-wide analytics and a more advanced data governance policy. Next, we research by means of clustering how these characteristics can indicate the analytics maturity stage of companies. As such, we discover four clusters with a clear growth path: no analytics, analytics bootstrappers, sustainable analytics adopters and disruptive analytics innovators. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Analytics maturity; Analytics techniques; Organizational characteristics; Survey research"

However, the gradual increase of the test suite size demands high portion of testing budget and time. Test Suite Reduction (TSR) is considered a potential approach to deal with the test suite size problem. Moreover, a complete automation support is highly recommended for software testing to adequately meet the challenges of a resource constrained testing environment. Several TSR frameworks and tools have been proposed to efficiently address the test-suite size problem. The main objective of the paper is to comprehensively review the state-of-the-art TSR frameworks to highlights their strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, the paper focuses on devising a detailed thematic taxonomy to classify existing literature that helps in understanding the underlying issues and proof of concept. Moreover, the paper investigates critical aspects and related features of TSR frameworks and tools based on a set of defined parameters. We also rigorously elaborated various testing domains and approaches followed by the extant TSR frameworks. The results reveal that majority of TSR frameworks focused on randomized unit testing, and a considerable number of frameworks lacks in supporting multi-objective optimization problems. Moreover, there is no generalized framework, effective for testing applications developed in any programming domain. Conversely, Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based TSR frameworks provide an optimal solution for multi-objective optimization problems and improve execution time by running multiple ILP in parallel. The study concludes with new insights and provides an unbiased view of the state-of-the-art TSR frameworks.

In earlier research it was characterized as the famous “IT productivity paradox.” Decades of research effort later, many IS/IT researchers no longer consider this relationship paradoxical, but it remains a challenge to fully explain “IT productivity variance,” that is, a large portion of unexplainable performance variance observed in empirical studies. In this paper, we take a theory development approach to this important issue. Our effort focuses on examining the theoretical foundation of “IT productivity variance.” Through literature review, we identify and contrast three prevailing theoretical perspectives to suggest the plausibility of a contingency approach. Contextual factors can significantly affect the relationship between IT investment and performance improvement. We identified three such factors that were not thoroughly examined: level of performance measurement, technology type, and technology life cycle. We subsequently propose a contingency model in light of these factors, and develop a set of research propositions. Our effort is a first-step toward bridging a major gap in the literature.

Classification is paramount for a complete records management other than safeguarding vital records upon determining their value for business continuity. Prior to that, a number of records management models were analysed with the aim to identify whether the Syariah Courts hold onto a specific model in executing electronic records management. Model generally takes the form of inputs, processes, and outputs or expected results in a simplified representation of a limited part of reality with related elements. The study adopts a survey method with interview and document content analysis as the techniques in analysing the models. The interview served as a snapshot study with the aim to reveal the issues embraced by the e-Syariah systems namely the Syariah Court Case Management System. Upon analysing the existing models, it was discovered there are flaws in the existing models making them inappropriate for implementation as they are too theoretical in nature. Furthermore, none of the models address on records classification. On the other hand, the interviews depicted that the electronic records management carried out in the Syariah Court is without the adoption of any model.

The former is about filtering the significance in the appropriate format, while the latter provides emerging categories of the whole domain. This path of the data is a bottom-up flow. On the other hand, the path of the process is a top-down flow, starting at the strategic level of business and scientific institutions. Today, the path of the process treasures a sizeable amount of well-known methods, architectures and technologies: the so called Big Data. On the top, Big Data analytics aims variable association (e-commerce), data mining (predictive behaviour) or clustering (marketing segmentation). Digging the Big Data architecture there are a myriad of enabling technologies for data taking, storage and management. However the strategic aim is to enhance knowledge with the appropriate information, which does need of data, but not vice versa. In the way, the magnitude of upcoming data from the IoT will disrupt the data centres. To cope with the extreme scale is a matter of moving the computing services towards the data sources. This paper explores the possibilities of providing many of the IoT services which are currently hosted in monolithic cloud centres, moving these computing services into nano data centres (NaDa). Particularly, data-information processes, which usually are performing at sub-problem domains. NaDa distributes computing power over the already present machines of the IP provides, like gateways or wireless routers to overcome latency, storage cost and alleviate transmissions. Large scale questionnaires have been taken for 300 IT professionals to validate the points of view for IoT adoption. Considering IoT is by definition connected to the Internet, NaDa may be used to implement the logical low layer architecture of the services. Obviously, such distributed NaDa send results on a logical high layer in charge of the information-knowledge turn.

Starting from a literature review on KMSs used by SMEs and from a focus group with consultants/researchers operating in the field of information technology in SMEs, an empirical investigation was designed, developed and conducted through semi-structured interviews involving 61 selected SMEs operating in high tech industries. The paper highlights three main issues regarding the use of KMSs. Firstly, SMEs adopt and use more intensively traditional tools (KM-Tools) rather than new and more updated ones that are generally cheaper and easier to use. Secondly, SMEs adopt and make more intensive use of practices (KM-Practices) that do not exclusively focus on the knowledge management process, but seek to adapt practices they already know to the requirements of knowledge management. Finally, the paper points out that there is a relationship of reciprocity between KM-Tools and KM-Practices: one reinforces the other and vice versa.

The present article addresses this by proposing what could be called ‘crowd-authoring’ – an approach in which a global group of academics work together to co-author a manuscript. It addresses the following question: To what extent is it technically and politically feasible to bring together an international crowd of academics to author an article? It reports on an experiment wherein 101 scholars of education and technology spread across the globe collaborated in three rounds via email to write a 9000-word manuscript. Despite the technical challenges and the political tensions among the authors, it was found that crowd-authoring could be put into practice. The recommendation is therefore that funding agencies should sponsor an intercontinental group of academics to form an ‘assembly of authoring’, the task of which is to constantly compose authoritative articles on a regular basis. Such an assembly of authoring could, moreover, be funded to develop into an ‘assembly of action’, with its members explicitly seeking to bring about changes and social interventions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Authorship; Collaboration; Information; Innovation; Knowledge; Method; Methodology; Research; Scholarship"

Findings from Study 1 (an overall travelers group) and Study 2 (two different country-of-residence groups: foreign and domestic travelers) show that food, value, atmosphere, and service are considered as substantially important criteria in selecting restaurants, in that order. However, results from Study 3 examining different restaurant types (low-priced food stand, low-priced indoor, and high-priced indoor) reveal that the food attribute is the most important factor, regardless of restaurant types, whereas the other attributes’ rankings vary. Results from Study 4 dividing the sample by both traveler origin and restaurant type demonstrate a total disparity in the importance ranking for all attributes. This study suggests that a conjoint analysis is an appropriate method for restaurant sector research in predicting the most important determinants consumers perceive among restaurant attributes.

Topics expressed in consumer reviews (collected from Amazon.com) are explored using a machine learning technique (i.e. latent semantic analysis). This study documents the thematic differences between positive and negative reviews and finds that negative reviews report service-related failures while positive reviews relate more to the product, among other things. Next, the informational support aspect of social commerce is explored by identifying the topics expressed in reviews that are helpful in purchase decisions. The findings demonstrate that potential customers (i.e. those who would like to purchase a product in the near future and currently are reading reviews with the intention to decide whether or not to buy that product) find the negative reviews containing service failure information and the positive reviews containing information on core functionalities, technical aspects, and aesthetics to be more helpful.

We then used data mining techniques to elucidate the effects of patients’ characteristics, pre-hospital resuscitation treatments, and spatial factors on post-OHCA survivability. With this information, public health institutions can enhance the EMS by allocating properly first-aid resources at the right places to improve the survival rate of OHCA patients. Methods We used New Taipei City, Taiwan as the scope of this study. Data of all registered OHCA cases in New Taipei City in 2011 were reviewed retrospectively. The dataset was combined with the National Doorplate Database to enhance the granularity of spatial analyses. Global and local spatial analyses based on Global Moran's Index, Local Moran's Index, and Getis-Ord Gi* statistic were performed to cluster high risk districts for OHCA in New Taipei City. Statistical methods such as Chi-square test, logistic regression, and decision tree were then adopted to analyze factors influencing 2-h survivability after OHCA. Results Significant spatial clustering of OHCA events was found (p < 0.05) in the western side of New Taipei City. We found that the 2-h survival rate after OHCA was significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with type of OHCA, EMT-P (Emergency Medical Technicians-Paramedic) dispatch, intubation, drug administration, onsite ROSC (Return of Spontaneous Circulation), AED (Automated External Defibrillator) usage, bystander witnessing, AED initial cardiac rhythm, cardiac rhythm recovery before admission, and past histories of diabetes and renal disease. Conclusions Based on the finding of this study, several important factors of OHCA can be improved to enhance the quality of the EMS service. With the spatial analysis of OHCA hotspots, public health institutions can manage the first-aid resources more efficiently and make EMS policies more effectively. As a result, the survival rate of OHCA patients can be improved. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Data mining; Emergency medical service (EMS); Factor analysis; Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA); Spatial analysis"

This research offers several salient findings. First, it shows that user experience positively moderates the relationship between uncertainty costs (one type of switching cost) and user resistance. It also negatively moderates the association between perceived value and user resistance. Second, the research test results demonstrate that users with a high degree of prior experience with the voice user interface of other smart devices exhibit low user resistance to change to the voice user interface in an IVI system. Third, we show that three types of switching costs (transition costs, in particular) may directly influence users to resist a change to the voice user interface. Fourth, our test results empirically demonstrate that both switching costs and perceived value affect user resistance to change in the context of an IVI system, which differs from the traditional IS research setting (i.e. enterprise systems). These findings may guide not only platform leaders in designing user interfaces, user experiences, and marketing strategies, but also firms that want to defend themselves from platform envelopment while devising defensive strategies in platform and standards competition. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We extend the privacy calculus model by exploring how the characteristics of service providers and the interpersonal difference of users influence privacy trade-off. An online empirical survey that involves 913 respondents was conducted. We find that both monetary rewards and social rewards positively predict self-disclosure intention, whereas only social rewards positively predict self-disclosure honesty. Moreover, application reputation and flow experience of users weaken the perceptions of privacy concern, and application compatibility and flow experience strengthen the perceptions of social rewards. Our results suggest that users place more weight on social rewards than on monetary rewards. Therefore, service providers are advised to create salient and distinct social rewards.

As these organizations invest in information technology and develop needed capabilities, there is a need to understand the effects of these factors on performance. Therefore, drawing on systems theory, we develop a theoretical model, consisting of three key variables: E-health compatibility, E-health synergy and the integration effort, to form the IT-enabled resources for investigating their effects on hospital performance. Data gathered from top management teams through a large-scale survey is used to test the hypotheses. The empirical results provide evidence that greater integration effort drives greater E-health synergy by enhancing E-health compatibility. In turn, these IT-enabled resources enhance healthcare organization performance. In addition, the integration effort can drive hospital performance through enhanced E-health compatibility and E-health synergy. Our findings highlight the important role of E-health compatibility and E-health synergy in mediating the integration effort effect on hospital performance. These findings are particularly valuable to those concerned with the assimilation of E-health and to administrators in healthcare organizations. Healthcare organizations can develop Ehealth compatibility and E-health synergy capabilities and devote integration efforts to integrate an IT asset and an organizational resource in accordance with their organizational context. This assists the healthcare organization in preparing for the necessary changes to ensure better hospital performance through the exploitation of e-health technology. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","E-health alignment; E-health compatibility; E-health synergy; Hospital performance; Integration effort; IT adaption; Systems theory"

Although the evolution of cloud computing has not reached the maturity level, there is still adequate research about the topic. The main purpose of this paper is to examine the development and evolution of cloud computing over time. A content analysis was conducted for 236 scholarly journal articles, which were published between 2009 and 2014 in order to (i) identify the possible trends and changes in cloud computing over the six years, (ii) compare publishing productivity of journals about the cloud computing subject, and (iii) guide future research about cloud computing. The results show that the majority of the cloud computing research is about ""cloud computing adoption"" (19%), and it was followed by the ""legal and ethical issues"" of cloud computing (15%). It is also found that ""cloud computing for mobile applications"" (6%), ""benefits & challenges of cloud computing"" (5%) and ""energy consumption dimension of cloud computing"" (4%) are the least attention-grabbing themes in the literature. However, ""cloud computing for mobile applications"" and ""energy consumption dimension of cloud computing"" themes have become popular in the last two years, so they are expected to be trendy topics of the near future. Finally, another finding of this study is that the majority of the articles were published by engineering, information systems or technical journals such as ""IT Professional Magazine"", ""International Journal of Information Management"" and ""Mobile Networks and Applications"". It seems as if this topic is generally ignored by the managerial and organizational journals even though the impact of cloud computing on organizations and institutions is immense and is in need of investigation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the significant changes faced by this industry is the evolution of computer-animation data and, yet, extant literature has offered very little insights into the evolution process and management issues pertinent to computer- animation data. Hence, many questions have surfaced in the extant literature of computer- animation data management. For example, to what extent has the data content expanded in terms of quantity and quality? To what extent has the information technology used to store and process the data changed? To what extent have the user and the community groups diversified in terms of their nature and number? Knowledge pertaining to these issues can provide new research directions to academics and also insights to practitioners for more effective and innovative management of computer- animation data. This conceptual paper, therefore, takes the pioneering step to address these issues by proposing four factors prudent for examining the evolution phases associated with computer-animation data management: technology, content, users, and community. Next, this paper presents a conceptual framework illustrating the inter- dependent relationships between these four factors together with associated theoretical and managerial issues.

This study examines the UK's Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) and considers the wider regulatory landscape in the UK. Although based on EU legislation, the DPA has shortcomings in enforcement and in regulating global services using national legislation. Lessig's model of internet regulation was used as a starting point to examine the alternative regulatory mechanisms that apply to personal data on SNSs. Interviews with industry experts highlighted self-regulation as a major influence on the behaviour of users and SNS providers. This has been incorporated into a new model of regulation that applies to SNSs. The resulting model has identified the following modes: law (statutory legislation), self-regulation (privacy policies and self-regulation of the online advertising industry), code (the way services are designed and their system architecture), and norms (expressed as user behaviour and collectively as market behaviour). The paper concludes that this new model of regulation is needed to adequately describe the current regulatory landscape as it applies to social media.

Hence, the research objectives are to (1) test empirically that the conceptual stages-of-growth model suits the evolution of social media adoption in organisations, and based on the lessons learned to (2) provide recommendations to revise the empirical model. Furthermore, we propose a three-tier typology for classifying organisations based on the potential of their adopted social media.

This study uses a goal hierarchy approach to deepen our understanding of the relationship between the use of Facebook and psychological well-being (PWB) in young adults. The study applies a mixed-method design that combines means-end analysis and regression analysis to examine data collected from laddering interviews with 161 Facebook users. The means-end chain analysis provided knowledge of the hierarchical goal structure in Facebook (i.e., activities → mediated goals → ultimate goals). Regression analysis was used to identify the relationships between the ultimate goals of Facebook use (e.g., psychological stability, belongingness) and the dimensions of PWB (e.g., self-acceptance, autonomy). The findings explain the significant association of Facebook use with well-being and the dual outcomes of enjoyment (positive in SNS; negative in users’ lives). Prior research focused on relationships among abstract factors, but this study delivers a more specific and nuanced explanation of user behavior on SNSs by providing knowledge of how specific Facebook activities relate to goals and PWB. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Facebook use; Goal hierarchy; Mixed-method research; Psychological well-being; Social network sites; Young adults"

This augmentation is generally achieved through the capabilities of stationary resources in cloud data centers. However, these resources are mostly not free and sometimes not available. Mobile devices are becoming powerful day by day and can form a self-organizing mobile ad-hoc network of nearby devices and offer their resources as on-demand services to available nodes in the network. In the ad-hoc mobile cloud, devices can move after consuming or providing services to one another. During this process, the problem of incentives arises for a node to provide service to another device (or other devices) in the network, which ultimately decreases the motivation of the mobile device to form an ad-hoc mobile cloud. To solve this problem, we propose a directory-based architecture that keeps track of the retribution and reward valuations (in terms of energy saved and consumed) for devices even after they move from one ad-hoc environment to another. From simulation results, we infer that this framework increases the motivation for mobile devices to form a self-organizing proximate mobile cloud network and to share their resources in the network. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Nonetheless, we have little knowledge about how certain characteristics of SNS fulfill their users' need for social connection and enhance this connectivity. Building on uses and gratification theory, this study of Twitter users posits that users are drawn to SNS to fulfill their social connection needs and that the sense of social presence SNS engender plays a significant role in fulfilling these needs. We argue that this sense of social presence is formed by immediacy-related characteristics (represented as immediate feedback) and intimacy-related characteristics (represented as feelings of privacy and responsiveness) of SNS in Twitter. We further investigate how those characteristics operate differently on mobile and non-mobile users. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 798 Twitter users and analyzed their responses using a structural equation model. The results support our research model. Furthermore, analysis of the responses of 367 primarily mobile users and 161 primarily desktop users indicates that the linkage between immediacy-related characteristics and social presence is stronger and the linkage between intimacy-related characteristics and social presence is weaker among mobile users than desktop users of Twitter. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To leverage this new means of marketing, one must understand what engages SNS users in a favorable online behavior (i.e., overtly indicating personal interest in, or support for, the exposed message by clicking the Like or Share button in Facebook), thereby resulting in an effective advertising campaign. This research conceptualizes SNS ad effectiveness as a concept encompassing emotional appeal, informativeness and creativity that all have a potential to contribute to a positive online behavior. It empirically investigates the antecedents of positive user behavior for a SNS ad based on the theory of reasoned action, the social influence theory, and a persuasion theory. It proposes and tests a conceptual model of the formation of online user's behavioral responses with regards to SNS advertising. The results of our empirical tests of the model reveal that informativeness and advertising creativity were key drivers of favorable behavioral responses to an SNS ad and that intention to engage in favorable user responses was positively associated with purchase intention. Based on these findings, the paper suggests further research directions and offers implications for harnessing the full potential of the new SNS advertising platform. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The increasing popularity of social-collaboration tools as an employee-oriented communication channel, inevitably raises questions about the future of email as its intensive use by knowledge workers is more and more perceived as being inefficient and unproductive. Through a quantitative case study methodology, this study seeks to explore the role played by the notion of habit in explaining employee knowledge sharing capability for firms implementing social collaborative practices in the context of no-email initiatives. Data collected within a large international IT services company, which is among the first firms having made such shift, were used to test the developed conceptual model. The findings suggest that habit is positively influenced by relative advantage and perceived ease of use while relative advantage was found to positively impact knowledge sharing capability. Besides, habit moderates the relationships between three attributes (relative advantage, perceived ease of use, and compatibility to a lesser extent) and knowledge sharing capability.

Gamification refers to technologies that attempt to promote intrinsic motivations toward various activities, commonly, by employing design characteristic to games. However, a dearth of empirical evidence still exists regarding why people want to use gamification services. Based on survey data gathered from the users of a gamification service, we examine the relationship between utilitarian, hedonic and social motivations and continued use intention as well as attitude toward gamification. The results suggest that the relationship between utilitarian benefits and use is mediated by the attitude toward the use of gamification, while hedonic aspects have a direct positive relationship with use. Social factors are strongly associated with attitude, but show only a weak further association with the intentions to continue the use of a gamification service. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study uses a single case study to extend the existing literature on technological gatekeepers through helping to fill two theoretical gaps. Firstly, by examining how gatekeepers operate in a new functional area: a technical hardware and software product support department. Secondly, by focusing on a site where corporate information systems and repositories were used to support gatekeeping activities. This focus on new organisational and systems contexts enabled the development of new categorisations within each phase of gatekeeping activity, resulting in a revised model of gatekeeper behaviour. Two new and distinct modes of knowledge acquisition were identified: reactive acquisition to solve immediate problems and proactive acquisition that was related to emerging technologies. Whether knowledge had been validated or was provisional was identified as a new concept to be considered during the acquisition phase. The systems focus enabled a number of new forms of knowledge translation and dissemination to be categorised. Rationalised translation involved clarifying and elaborating on translations held in the corporate repository while tiered translations enabled versions of translations to be electronically available to different levels of users. While interpersonal dissemination was present the increasing reliance on information systems for dissemination diminished the traditional need for gatekeepers to expended time and energy developing social networks. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Existing studies on online knowledge adoption have primarily focused on the perspective of knowledge provider. Knowledge recipients, however, also play a fundamental role in knowledge adoption. Informational and normative social influence theory is utilized as the theoretical foundation to investigate the influences of informational and normative factors on online knowledge adoption. Based on the theories and previous literature, this study proposes a theoretical model of knowledge adoption, in which knowledge quality and source credibility serve as informational determinants, whereas knowledge consensus and knowledge rating serve as normative determinants. In addition, time pressure is hypothesized to be a moderator that impacts the dual evaluation process toward knowledge adoption. Data collected from 510 respondents was tested against the research model using the partial least squares approach. The findings demonstrate that both informational and normative determinants had positive effects on knowledge adoption, while the moderating test indicates that time pressure exerted influences with different directions on the two evaluation processes of adopting behavior. Theoretical and practical contributions are also outlined. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Informational and normative influence; Knowledge adoption; Time pressure; Virtual community"

Currently, various secure deduplication encryption schemes have be designed to protect the privacy of clients' data. However, they cannot ensure an economical-selfish cloud service provider to manage the data system with an optimal duplication price. This will create a strong disincentive for the clients to be involved in the deduplication. In this paper, we first propose a secure payment-based incentive mechanism for deduplication systems which can enhance the efficiency of data management. The security and incentive analysis show that any malicious cloud service provider cannot deceive a client with a higher deduplication price. Our mechanism could incent the clients to participate the deduplication since the price per bit of an active client is always lower than that of a passive one. Moreover, our mechanism shows that the total profit of cloud service provider will increase even if the payment of each client is decreased. Therefore, the cloud service provider is also stimulated for deduplication. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Data was collected through interviews in Britain, Ireland and Australia with LIS professionals, educators, and representatives of professional bodies. The findings identify the main types of dilemma raised and discuss cases indicative of each type. They suggest that new technologies do not appear to change ethical principles but, when experienced in the workplace, substantially change the factors the professional has to evaluate. They also suggest that relevant codes of ethics are satisfactory on traditional library issues of access and confidentiality, but do not address the ethical challenges of current and potential digital environments. Professional associations appear more familiar with codes of ethics than practitioners although practitioners show high levels of ethical awareness, suggesting associations need to communicate more with their members and provide tools that are more useful in the workplace.

Many features imposed by the ERP template did not fit in the Chinese context. This present article describes what happened next. Rather than resist the system totally by not using it, the Chinese users worked around the misfits by inventing their own solutions known as workarounds. These enabled the ERP system as a whole to be workable in China but caused problems at company headquarters as some transparency was lost and the information provided was seen as potentially misleading. A project team was set up to examine each of these workarounds and decide whether they should be formalized or prevented. The result was a system accepted by users and management alike. Reflections on the case include a discussion on management attitude change, the positive and negative aspects of workarounds, the importance of good communications and the role of the researcher. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Case study; China; ERP; Global systems; Post-implementation; Workarounds"

This has led to an increase in the number of information needs and, at the same time, to a decrease in the ""efficiency"" of reports in terms of how many information needs they address. As a consequence, the number of reports has exploded. This slows down knowledge workers' manual or automated search for information, resulting in high search costs to companies. However, it can be observed that in many cases only a small subset of all reports is (still) relevant to knowledge workers. The remainder is an unnecessary burden that could be sorted out without obstructing the access to information that still is needed. In this paper, we develop a framework to identify such reports and archive them automatically. The relevance of reports is concluded from users' information retrieval behavior as recorded in the log files of the BI system, particularly of its search component. We evaluate the proposed framework through a simulation study. The results indicate that the integration of an automated archiving component into a BI system can significantly reduce search effort and, hence, search costs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous research conducted with surveys and atypical IM interactions support such claims; however, prior research demonstrated with a systematic study and behavioral measures that IM-ing is not detrimental to quality and timeliness of work. The current study expands the research literature by examining the effects of frequent IM-ing on productivity, quality of work, and time on-task in a laboratory setting. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and independent samples t-tests for group and IM type. Data demonstrated little performance differences between those who received IMs and those who did not. This research appears to suggest that IM-ing has some impact on overall task completion time but IM-ers productivity time was faster. Therefore, it may be more harmful to resort to the commonly held notion that all off-task behavior equates negative effects and unproductive employees.

Application of the framework identifies three key capabilities that can frame the contribution of social media engagement in this context: (1) consistency in managing social interactions, (2) creating content to engage with specific audiences and (3) using social media as information sources to develop network alertness. Moving beyond simply characterising social media engagement in terms of the speed and volume of social interactions, this study contributes to a more systematic examination of the concept as an enabler of organisational responsiveness. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Consumer organizations; Food communication; Organisational responsiveness; Social media; Stakeholder engagement"

The introduction of learning organizations is seen as a promising choice for better knowledge management and continuing professional development in health care. This study analyzes the effects of a learning organization on nurses' continuing professional development, knowledge management, and retention in a health and social services centre in Quebec, Canada. The learning organization seemed to affect daily nursing work in a positive manner, despite its variable impact on other professionals and other sites outside the hospital centre. These changes were particularly pronounced with respect to knowledge transfer, support for nursing practices, and quality of health care, objectives that the learning organization had sought to meet since its inception. However, it seemed to have a limited effect on nurse retention. © 2015 The Authors.","Continuous learning; Knowledge management; Learning organization; Nursing"

Prior studies have indicated that high risks result in low performance in IT projects, whereas effective enforcement of formal and informal controls enhances performance. These two streams have been integrated by examining the interactions between environment risks and control. However, contradictory findings have been presented given that environment risks can positively or negatively moderate the effect of control on performance. Furthermore, the collective effects of environment risks and controls across different stakeholders remain unknown. Quantitative analysis of data from 128 completed IT projects in China indicates that internal environment risk negatively moderates the effect of formal and informal controls on the product performance of IT projects from the perspectives of PMs and ULs. By contrast, external environment risk positively moderates the effectiveness of controls, thereby indicating the significant and diverse moderating roles of various environment risks in the relationship of control and performance. Environment risks can be threats to or facilitators of the success of IT projects. In addition, external environment risk moderates the effect of formal control on product performance for ULs more than internal environment risk, whereas the moderating effect of internal environment risk for PMs is stronger than that of external environment risk. This finding provides additional evidence that the moderating effects of internal and external environment risks differ among various stakeholders. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Environment risk; Formal and informal control; Information technology; Project management; Stakeholder"

Recent reviews identified individual and organizational factors as having the most important influence on EHR adoption and proposed taking a multidimensional perspective to study these adoption determinants. However, most studies have focused on physician EHR adoption measured at the individual level. Objectives First, we used a multilevel regression model to assess whether organizations' characteristics influenced physician behavioral intention to use EHR. Second, we sought to identify individual and organizational factors that explain physician intention. Methods We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study among physicians in 49 primary healthcare organizations in four regions of the province of Quebec (Canada). We first analyzed relationships between individual and organizational variables and intention. Second, we performed multilevel modeling to explore organizational characteristics' impact on physician intention to use EHR. Results 278 completed questionnaires were returned from the 31 organizations that had at least 5 participants (response rate: 39.8%). Questionnaires showed satisfactory psychometric properties. The multilevel modeling found no significant overall influence of organizational level on physician intention to use EHR. Second, six of the individual level constructs had a positive and strongly significant impact on physician intention. Conclusion In the Quebec context, organization-level seems to have no significant impact on EHR adoption by physicians. Hence, particular strategies are more likely to succeed if they target individual physicians rather than organizations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The benefits of such systems appear pervasive, but no hard data is available that confirms that their implementation improves organizational performance. In part, this is due to the difficulty of measuring the effects of enterprise-wide initiatives in general. In this paper, the results are presented of a longitudinal, multi-case study into the effectiveness of workflow management technology. The study builds on a novel methodology that combines field work and computer simulations. Through its application, the contribution of this technology to conduct business processes faster and with less effort could be quantitatively assessed. Surprisingly, only a fraction of the projects that were followed in this longitudinal study led to a fully operational implementation of a workflow management system at all. Even so, in most of the projects where such a system was introduced this resulted in substantial improvements.

One essential problem related to this development is that the BPM body of knowledge does not account for a broader variety of business contexts. On the contrary, most approaches, methods, or models in BPM suggest one way forward, and we recognize that BPM projects following a one-size-fits-all approach are prone to fail, since they do not sufficiently consider situational requirements. In this viewpoint article, we argue that BPM needs to be contextual in order for projects to be most efficient and effective. We observe a lack of research on how to identify and characterize business contexts relevant for tailoring the right BPM approach. Therefore, we examine contextual factors that influence BPM and propose a framework to identify the context in which BPM is applied. We define context in BPM as situational factors related to goal-, process-, organization-, and environment-dimensions.

In Twitter, retweeting is the most important information propagation mechanism, and supernodes (news medias) that have many followers are the most important information sources. Therefore, it is important to understand the news retweet propagation from supernodes and predict news popularity quickly at the very first few seconds upon publishing. Such understanding and prediction will benefit many applications such as social media management, advertisement and interaction optimization between news medias and followers. In this paper, we identify the characteristics of news propagation from supernodes from the trace data we crawled from Twitter. Based on the characteristics, we build a news popularity prediction model that can predict the final number of retweets of a news tweet very quickly. Through trace-driven experiments, we then validate our prediction model by comparing our predicted popularity and real popularity, and show its superior performance in comparison with the regression prediction model. From the study, we found that the average interaction frequency between the retweeters and the news source is correlated with news popularity. Also, the negative sentiment of news has some correlations with retweet popularity while the positive sentiment of news does not have such obvious correlation.","News popularity prediction; Social news media; Twitter"

Informed by prior relevant literature on general systems, organizational information processing, corruption, as well as e-Government, the proposed framework argues that the prevalence of corruption in developing economies could restrict moral and governance capabilities of administrative systems overseeing e-Governments in a way that could lead to the failure of these entities to produce initiatives that meet stakeholders' expectations.

Such discretionary conduct is called online community citizenship behavior (OCCB). This study integrates social support and social identity theory to examine factors affecting citizenship behaviors in online support communities. In the research model, we theorize that online community citizenship behavior is driven mainly by two social mechanisms: (1) the social support mechanism, which transfers the effect of online social support first to self-efficacy, self-esteem, and subjective well-being, and then to citizenship behavior; and (2) the social identity mechanism, which relates the perceived external prestige and distinctiveness of online support communities to community identification and, in turn, to citizenship behavior. Data collected from 159 valid users of online support communities provides partial support for the research model. The findings indicate that perceived external prestige and community distinctiveness positively affect an individual's identification with an online support community, which in turn has a positive effect on OCCB. Social support has a positive effect on self-efficacy, self-esteem and subjective well-being. Subjective well-being has a stronger effect on OCCB than does community identification.

Through the conduction of behavioral experiments with eye-tracking technology, the findings show that, under high-involvement situations, both seller reputation and product presentation significantly and independently influence product quality evaluation while their interaction effect does not. While under low-involvement situations, seller reputation significantly influences the product evaluation and moderates the effect of product presentation on consumer product quality evaluation. The effect of product presentation on product evaluation is weakened by seller reputation.

A main objective of this paper is to examine the role of big data in facilitating the access to financial products for economically active low-income families and micro-enterprises in China. A second objective is to investigate how formal and informal institutions facilitate and constrain the use of big data in the Chinese financial industry and market. The paper also investigates how various inherent characteristics of big data - volume, velocity, variety, variability and complexity - are related to the assessment of the creditworthiness of low-income families and micro-enterprises. Case studies of big data deployment in the Chinese financial industry and market are discussed. The paper also looks at various categories of personal financial and non-financial information that are being used as proxy measures for a potential borrower's identity, ability to repay and willingness to repay. Various business models involving the sources of data (internal vs. external to the big data organization) and providers of credits (big data organization vs. external partners or clients of the big data organization) are investigated. The analysis of the paper indicates that the main reason why low-income families and micro-enterprises in China and other emerging economies lack access to financial services is not because they lack creditworthiness but merely because banks and financial institutions lack data, information and capabilities to access the creditworthiness of and effectively provide financial services to this financial disadvantaged group. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The research question in this paper is the following: How can Web-based decision support help citizens to make calculated public service choices in quasi-markets? In Section 3, the paper focuses on how decision support design helps citizens make such choices as they isolate, examine, and rank alternatives. A case study, set in Sweden, explores 14 cases of decision support in education, healthcare, elder care, and the public pension system. Decision support is most evident in the area of education, but decision support is found in the other areas as well. In most cases, the support consists of information on the right of choice and instructions on how to search among alternatives. Many areas permit direct comparisons, but some areas only permit more indirect comparisons. All 14 cases explain how to make a choice, but only a few cases offer a ranking device. The decision support for choice is inconsistent with the theoretical model of calculated choice in all aspects despite the trend toward greater consistency with the model.

The synthesis of various scientific methodologies and technical approaches that we use led to this unique and novel and fully practical solution. In our opinion one of the most valuable elements of Knowledge Bricks is the application of the Gesture Description Language technology as a natural user interface and easy to manage gestures knowledge base usable for teachers when they are designing virtual worlds or visual information management application. The task-based architecture of the virtual world enables a clear definition of the interaction goal. What is more, our implementation based on off-the-shelf hardware has proven that deploying such an application in schools does not require expensive hardware or dedicated classrooms. We evaluated our approach on a group of students of different ages, particularly of the pre-school and primary school age for whom we believe our proposition will be the most valuable and attractive. Based on this system evaluation we can conclude that our natural user interface can be successfully used for all the considered age groups. We believe that 6-9-year-olds are the best target group for our system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A network level perspective guided the sampling strategy adopted for this survey involving 150 members of 16 European learning networks. Hierarchical multiple regression and structural equation modelling were employed to investigate the inter-relationships between dimensions of social capital and knowledge sharing in learning networks. The results reveal that social interaction and cognitive social capital are positively and significantly related to knowledge sharing in learning networks. Social interaction is also shown to play an important role in the development of shared vision and shared language (i.e. cognitive social capital) in learning networks. This paper sheds further light on the inter-relationships between different dimensions of social capital from a network (rather than firm) level perspective, and contributes to emerging theory on the antecedents to, and assessment of, performance in learning network entities. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",""

Despite established management regimes and available technology, many organizations still consider information and records management challenging. The reason may be cultural factors. This study based on a literature review, aims to explore the academic discourse on information culture and to discuss its relevance for records management. The findings show that the concept information culture is used in various ways: as an explanatory framework; as an analytical and evaluative tool; or as normative standard. The research on information culture addresses several areas: business performance, systems implementation, the manifestation of information culture in different organizations, and a few concerns records management practices. The research settings and the objects of study varied, why general conclusions are difficult to draw, but often a positive correlation between culture and performance is assumed. The focus has been on how information is used, shared and disseminated, while the production and management, that is the vital object of records management, has with few exceptions been neglected. If information culture should fully function as an analytical framework concerning records management, a widened and more inclusive conceptualization is required, which also will enrich information culture as a theoretical concept. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It is playing an increasingly important role in influencing consumers' purchase intentions. Social commerce uses friendships on social networking platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, as the vehicle for social sharing about products or sellers to induce interest in a product, thereby increasing the purchase intention. In this paper, we develop and validate a conceptual model of how social factors, such as social support, seller uncertainty, and product uncertainty, influence users' purchasing behaviors in social commerce. This study aims to provide an understanding of the relationship between user behavior and social factors on social networking platforms. Using the largest social networking website in China, renren.com, this study finds that social support, seller uncertainty, and product uncertainty affect user behaviors.

Because small firms have a lower portfolio of financial resources to compete more effectively in the market, social media capabilities can become more important for small than large firms. However, prior research has failed in explaining the variables through which small firms can learn to adopt social media. Our study is a first effort to address this research gap. We propose a conceptual model in which social competitor pressure, IT infrastructure capability, two organizational capabilities (marketing management and innovation management) and firm size enable small firms to learn to develop a social media competence. The model is tested using the partial least squares-based structural equation modeling technique employing a unique secondary dataset on a sample composed of the 100 small U.S. firms included in the 2013 Forbes America's Best Small Companies ranking. The empirical analysis suggests that IT infrastructure capability, social competitor pressure, marketing management and innovation management are key mechanisms through which small firms learn to develop a social media competence. The empirical analysis also suggests that social media competence is more important for the smallest manufacturing firms even among a sample of small firms. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Leveraging the process-based view of IT, we establish a theoretical framework for the mediation factors for the relationship between IT capabilities and performance. Based on a survey of 127 companies in China, we find that a firm's management capabilities to manage both its internal and external business processes fully mediate the impact of IT on firm performance. The two management capabilities in this study are business-process management capability and supply-chain management capability. Our results show that only the coherent integration of IT capability with firm's ability to optimize business processes and to improve management of supply chains can enhance firm performance.

Further, because the proposed procedure does not rely on historical rating or purchase records, it properly addresses the new user problem, that is, the difficulty in recommending products to users whose past rating or purchase records are not available. To validate the recommendation procedure, we conducted experiments with footwear commercial videos.

The results indicate that effort expectation, social influence, trust in e-government, and perceived risk have significant effects on the intention to adopt e-invoicing. Additionally, trust in e-government and perceived risk mediates the relationship between behavioral intention and security concerns regarding e-government. Gender differences moderate the relationship between social influence and behavioral intention. Age level is found to moderate the relationship between perceived risk and behavioral intention. These findings contribute to academic research and have practical implications, advancing our understanding of cloud based e-government applications. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Cloud computing; Critical factor; e-Government; e-Invoice; Technology 2 (UTAUT2); Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of"

Furthermore, the information behaviour of local government policy workers has not been widely studied. We conducted semi-structured interviews with local government policy workers from UK local authorities and local government organisations. This was with the aim of examining how these policy workers use information to prepare documents. During the interviews, we asked the policy workers to demonstrate how they extracted information from source documents and how they made use of it. We found that the document preparation process involved three key phases: (1) information management (storing and recording information retrieved online for later use), (2) writing and editing (extracting information from source material and using it to support the writing process), and (3) review and sign-off (managing an iterative process of obtaining feedback from multiple stakeholders and making amendments). We discuss key challenges the interviewees faced during each of these phases and make recommendations for the design of future digital information environments aimed at providing holistic support for local government policy workers' information use behaviour. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Gender adds another level of difficulty when managing IT projects. Understanding country and gender - level differences may improve chances for success. This paper provides opportunities to better understand underlying country and gender differences of Indian IT workers. We used Hofstede's value surveys module to analyze gender differences and cultural preferences of 107 Indian IT workers. After correcting for problems with outliers, none of the mean differences between men and women were significant at the 95% level; at the 90% level, we found differences in uncertainty avoidance and long-term orientation only. Our results suggest that women and men working in the IT industry may have more similarities in terms of national culture than differences by gender. To overcome possible differences in uncertainty avoidance and long-term orientation, IT outsourcers to India should ensure adequate professional development opportunities, mentoring programs, and clearly explained career path opportunities. Further, a focus on policies and management strategies that capitalize on the national culture of India, including group work to take advantage of collectivist tendencies, and clearly defined hierarchical systems to take advantage of masculine orientation and high power distances, may allow foreign companies to attract and retain men and women, where in many cases, national culture trumps gender differences. Future research should collect more data from women and investigate the effect of regional differences on cultural perceptions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the full commitment to Cloud Computing necessary to gain the full benefit is a major project for any organisation, since it necessitates adoption of new business processes and attitudes to computing services in addition to the immediately obvious systems changes. Hence the evaluation of a Cloud Computing project needs to consider the balance of benefits and risks to the organisation in the full context of the environment in which it operates; it is not sufficient or appropriate to examine technical considerations alone. In this paper, we consider the application of CAPM, a well established approach used for the analysis of risks and benefits of commercial projects to Cloud adoption projects and propose a revised and improved technique, OSM. To support the validity of OSM, two full case studies are presented. In the first, we describe an application of the approach to the iSolutions Group at University of Southampton, which focuses on evaluations of Cloud Computing service improvement. We then illustrate the use of OSM for measuring learning satisfaction of two cohort groups at the University of Greenwich. The results confirm the advantages of using OSM. We conclude that OSM can analyse the risk and return status of Cloud Computing services and help organisations that adopt Cloud Computing to evaluate and review their Cloud Computing projects and services.

Hence, there is a particular necessity to understand impulse buying in the online context. Impulse shoppers incline to feel unable to control their tendencies and behaviors from various stimuli. Specifically, online consumers are both the impulse shoppers and the system users of websites in the purchase process. Impulse shoppers concern individual traits and system users cover the attributes of online stores. Online impulse buying therefore entails two key drivers, technology use and trust belief, and the mediator of flow experience. Grounding on flow experience, technology-use features, and trust belief, this study proposes a novel research model to examine impulse buying behavior in a complete manner. Data were collected from an online survey. Data analysis considers structural equation modeling technique with formative structure. Empirical results showed that flow experience is an important factor to affect impulse buying from its original drivers. Trust belief is also critical to impulse buying as perceived usefulness is not. Implications for managers and scholars are further discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Data from a sample of 302 organizations were collected to empirically test our model. The results indicate that a relational IT capability is the most influential factor to facilitate cloud success compared to technical and managerial IT capabilities. Furthermore, an evaluation of the interrelationships indicates that the public and hybrid cloud delivery models may be more dependent on relational IT capabilities for cloud success while the flexibility and agility of the firm's internal IT (technical IT capability) facilitates the public cloud. We discuss how IT-based capabilities may be used to leverage cloud delivery models to positively influence the successful implementation of cloud computing, and ultimately, firm performance for the processes and operations supported by the cloud. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Firm performance; Hybrid cloud; IT capabilities; Private cloud; Public cloud"

Growing evidence also shows that consumers on these platforms are prone to impulse buying behavior owing to the social interactions. However, existing research on online impulse buying was limited when illustrating the behavior of consumers on SCPs as social relationship constructs were not included. New theoretical developments are needed in regard to fill the research gap. In this research, parasocial interaction (PSI) theory is introduced in this research to examine the influence of social relationship factors on the formation of impulse buying behavior. An empirical research has been conducted on Mogujie (www.mogujie.com), one of the most popular image-sharing SCPs in China. Results indicate that PSI exerts an impact on impulse buying tendency, the social-relevant features of the SCP determine PSI, and perceived usefulness and PSI both significantly affect perceived enjoyment.

Data collected from 157 respondents was tested against the research model using a partial least squares (PLS) approach. The results indicate that functional value, emotional value, social value, and brand identification have a positive influence on smartphone brand loyalty. Of the two moderators, results show that age enhances the emotional value-brand loyalty and social value-brand loyalty linkages but weakens the brand identification-brand loyalty relationship.

Three levels of maturity of social media strategy are proposed: initiation, diffusion and maturity. Initiation includes the key elements: 'target audience' and 'channel choice' while all case organizations studied payed attention to these elements. Diffusion includes the elements: 'goals', 'resources' and 'policies'. Maturity adds the elements of 'monitoring' and 'content activities'.

Previously, information security issues were studied in a technological context, but growing security needs have extended researchers' attention to explore the management role in information security management. Various studies have explored different management roles and activities, but none has given a comprehensive picture of these roles and activities to manage information security effectively. So it is necessary to accumulate knowledge about various managerial roles and activities from literature to enable managers to adopt these for a more holistic approach to information security management. In this paper, using a systematic literature review approach, we synthesised literature related to management's roles in information security to explore specific managerial activities to enhance information security management. We found that numerous activities of management, particularly development and execution of information security policy, awareness, compliance training, development of effective enterprise information architecture, IT infrastructure management, business and IT alignment and human resources management, had a significant impact on the quality of management of information security. Thus, this research makes a novel contribution by arguing that a more holistic approach to information security is needed and we suggest the ways in which managers can play an effective role in information security.

In this study, we are interested in gaining insights on the effects of using EPGs on objective metrics (learning score, time effort) and subjective metrics (perceived usefulness, ease of use, and value), by comparing three EPG designs (a simple PDF-based EPG, a normal HTML-based EPG, and a sophisticated Java-based EPG) with different blocks of experimental subjects (practitioners, academicians, novices, and experts). To this end, we have conducted a controlled experiment with a sample of international participants in the domain of IT Service Management. We found that the utilization of EPGs improves the objective metrics while no improvements were perceived on the subjective ones, and that the sophisticated EPG design is more appropriate for the academic and expert types of users than for the practitioner and novice types.

Given the benefits to the social science disciplines in the advancement of scholarship, and the recent data sharing policy changes of funding agencies, it is necessary to determine the factors that support and impede data sharing behaviors. A research model was developed and validated based on the results of a survey of 361 social scientists. The model is informed by theory of planned behavior and institutional theory to map underlying individual motivations, institutional pressures, and availability of resources facilitating social scientists' data sharing. It was found that social scientists' data sharing behaviors are mainly driven by personal motivations (i.e., perceived career benefit and risk, perceived effort, and attitude toward data sharing) and perceived normative pressure. Funding agencies' pressure, journals' pressure, and availability of data repository were not found to be significant factors in influencing social scientists' data sharing. This research suggests that personal motivations and norm of data sharing currently support social scientists' data sharing; however, institutional pressures by funding agencies and journals and data repository need to be further encouraged to better facilitate social scientists' data sharing behaviors. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Data repository; Data sharing; Individual motivation; Institutional pressure; Social scientist"

Therefore, this study focuses on how online shopping via Facebook, peer recommendations, and website service quality affect consumer trust, attitudes and loyalty intentions in e-tailing. An online survey was conducted with Generation Y Italian consumers who used Facebook searches of various websites to shop for clothing online. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to validate the constructs, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to test the hypotheses. Findings confirm that website service quality and consumers' predispositions to use Facebook for online shopping directly and positively affect consumer trust toward an e-tailer. In contrast, peer recommendations affect attitude directly rather than indirectly via trust. The results further indicate that peer recommendations have a significantly stronger influence on attitudes of females than they do on attitudes of males. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Considering the perspectives of both the departing employee and the successor, we examine how employee perceptions of KC quality are affected by two normative influences: organizational knowledge management (KM) culture, and the KM behavior of the employee's current supervisor. Data were collected from 44 departing employees (who transitioned to new jobs) and their 44 successors, up to 6 months following job transition. Participants were full-time engineers employed in a large high- technology firm in Israel. The extent to which departing employees perceived the organization as fostering KM culture, and the extent to which they perceived their current supervisors as engaging in KM behavior, were, respectively, negatively and positively associated with KC quality as perceived by successors. Successors' perceived organizational KM culture was positively related to their perceptions of KC quality. Successors' perceptions of their own supervisors' KM behavior were not significantly associated with their perceptions of KC quality. We discuss the potential duality of responses to a work environment that supports KM, and ways to synchronize opposing effects.

A framework, cloud computing adoption framework (CCAF), is presented in details. CCAF has four major types of emerging services and each one has been explained in details with regard to the individual function and how each one can be integrated. CCAF is an architectural framework that blends software resilience, service components and guidelines together and provides real case studies to produce greater impacts to the organizations adopting cloud computing and security. CCAF provides business alignments and provides agility, efficiency and integration for business competitive edge. In order to validate user requirements and system designs, a large scale survey has been conducted with detailed analysis provided for each major question. We present our discussion and conclude that the use of CCAF framework can illustrate software resilience and security improvement for enterprise security.

In the modern free games, publishers sell virtual goods in order to generate revenue. However, game publishers face dire negative attitudes toward the business model as it can entice publishers to degrade the enjoyment of the game in order to sell more virtual goods that address the artificial gaps in the game. This study focuses on this looming question in the game industry whether people buy virtual goods because they enjoy the game and want to keep on playing it or rather because their attitudes toward virtual goods are favorable and they believe it is also accepted in the peer-group. Player responses (N = 2791) were gathered from three different game types: social virtual world (Habbo) (n = 2156), first-person shooters (n = 398), and social networking games (Facebook games) (n = 237). The results support both main hypotheses (1) enjoyment of the game reduces the willingness to buy virtual goods while at the same time it increases the willingness to play more of the game. Continued use, however, does positively predict purchase intentions for virtual goods. (2) Attitude toward virtual goods and the beliefs about peers' attitudes strongly increase the willingness to purchase virtual goods. Beyond these interesting results the paper points to several further lines of inquiry. ©2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Business model; Free-to-play; Freemium; Online game; Virtual goods"

Sporadic arguments, however, have been made that, depending on the antecedent, such a monolithic premise may not sustainable. Despite the rich evidence of the dichotomous role of success factors on measured consequences in non-IS fields, especially in the marketing discipline, theoretical and empirical efforts to examine this duality have received limited attention in IS research. Especially, no previous IS study took the extended duality position in which the role of success conditions can be any of pure enabler, pure inhibitor, asymmetric bi-directional influencer or symmetric bi-directional influencer. The extended duality becomes the theoretical thesis of this research, setting it apart from the scant IS research that viewed duality through the rather simplified lens of statistical significance in each direction. To test the validity of the extended duality theory in the IT service context, cross-sectional survey data were gathered on post-adoption usage of mobile data services (or MDS), the most prevalent form of IT service. Frequently used success conditions of IT service - system quality, information quality, economic value and self-efficacy - are chosen as the explanatory variables. The analysis suggests that success conditions of IT service can have a highly divergent and diversified form of duality effects on measured outcomes.

Through a fresh examination of this case and the 'information technologies' used within intelligence work of the day we achieve a number of things. First, we explore the enigmatic nature of what we term forma - the physical aspect of a seme or sign. We use the case to help illustrate the inherent relationship between the use of forma for mundane purposes of communication and the use of forma to remain mysterious; to mask communicative and performative action. Second, in unpacking the nature of formative action the case material helps re-establish the system in information system. It helps re-conceptualize and broaden the nature of information technology and illustrate more clearly the differences but also the connections between information systems and systems of such technology.

We conceptualized perceived risk as a multi-component construct, and examined the relationships between the individual risk components and the other variables in the model under consideration. First and foremost, the results indicated that consumer's trust expectation in an online merchant is a predictor of the consumer's choice between an e-tailer and an e-marketplace. It was further revealed that situational involvement positively affected all the five types of perceived risk, whereas only product performance risk was positively related to consumer's trust expectation. It may be inferred that the stronger product performance risk perception, the higher trust a consumer expects in an online merchant to engage in a transaction. The findings have important practical implications for developing e-commerce strategies not only for digital storefronts but also for online marketplaces that can help manage consumer's trust expectation and ultimately increase potential sales by mitigating related perceived risks involved in an online purchase.

It is stipulated that site expertise shapes the site use and acceptance differently and more profoundly than e-commerce expertise. The results show that users with low (vs. high) site expertise perceived the site as less easy to use, and their site acceptance was more (less) strongly influenced by the site information quality. Alternatively, e-commerce expertise played a different moderating role in the acceptance process, and users with low e-commerce expertise did not perceive the site as less easy to use.

It requires an organization to regularly update and create knowledge for the current generation, and reuse it later for the next generation of a product. In this regard, an integrated dynamic knowledge model is targeted to structurally define a practical knowledge creation process in the product development domain. This model primarily consists of three distinct elements; SECI (socialization-externalization-combination-internalization) modes, 'ba', and knowledge assets. The model involves tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge interplay in 'ba' to generate new knowledge during the four SECI modes and update the knowledge assets. It is believed that lean tools and methods can also promote learning and knowledge creation. Therefore, a set of ten lean tools and methods is proposed in order to support and improve the efficiency of the knowledge creation process. The approach first establishes a framework to create knowledge in the product development environment, and then systematically demonstrates how these ten lean tools and methods conceptually fit into and play a significant role in that process. Following this, each of them is analyzed and appropriately positioned in a SECI mode depending on best fit. The merits of each tool/method are discussed from the perspective of selecting the individual mode. The managerial implication is that correct and quick knowledge creation can result in faster development and improved quality of products. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","'ba'; Dynamic knowledge; Knowledge asset; Lean thinking; SECI mode"

Past attempts to develop neutral format standards for data exchange have had limited success, and have led to the development of STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product) as a data exchange standard. The STEP standard makes it easier to integrate systems that process various product life-cycle functions, such as design, engineering, manufacturing, logistics support, and will help to facilitate concurrent engineering. The goal of this paper is to facilitate the computer-readable exchange of the product bill of materials (BOM) information for product data management (PDM). In this paper, the STEP ISO 10303-21 is implemented to share the product data information in a manufacturing environment. A structural product bill of materials is first transformed into an Excel file format, then a PDM Schema Exporter is utilized to export a BOM Excel file to a STEP Part 21 file. A C# program decodes the STEP file into BOM information to update the PDM databases in SQL server for product data management. Also, SAS code is written to generate the indented bill of materials from the BOM information, to draw a tree diagram to present an accurate structural view of a product, and to export to PDM databases for product data structural view. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Bill of materials (BOM); ISO 10303; Product data exchange; Product data management (PDM); STEP Part 21 file"

There is, however, little empirical evidence as to exactly how mobile advertising works. This research examines the role of mental imagery elicited by mobile advertising and its mediating effect on trust in the advertising message (ad trust) and purchase intention. Using a 2 × 2 factorial experimental design, we examined the influence of the type of message - SMS vs. MMS - and type of content - informational vs. transformational - on the three dimensions of mental imagery: vividness, quantity and elaboration. Results show a greater impact of MMS mobile ads and transformational ads on vividness and elaboration, while SMS mobile ads have a greater impact on the quantity dimension. The study also suggests that ad trust can be improved by enhancing the mental imagery elicited by mobile ads. Vivid and elaborate mental imagery mediates the effect of the type of ad on ad trust and exerts a positive influence on purchase intention. These findings have important implications for mobile advertisers since overcoming trust issues remains a major obstacle in the adoption of this medium. In addition, practical aspects of mobile ads' conception and design are discussed and directions for future research are suggested. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Ad trust; Informational ad; Mental imagery; Mobile advertising; Transformational ad"

An extended technology acceptance model (TAM) is developed to test citizen engagement towards online e-government services from a sample of 307 citizens who used the benefits advisor tool within a Spanish City Hall. Although the proposed model follows TAM and explains the intention towards the actual use of e-government by postulating four direct determinants, ""A, PU, PEOU and BI"" have been considered as parallel processes, meaning that each can have separate influence in different levels of citizen engagement. To achieve this goal, a multinomial logistic regression is developed and tested to confirm the explanatory power of the four technology enablers on the four different levels of e-government. Our findings further suggest that in order to implement e-government, some of the enablers matter more than others to move from one level of citizen engagement to another. The main contribution of the paper is to question the use of existing models which seek to represent the relationship between technology enablers and the adoption of e-government services without considering their impacts on citizens' engagement.

We conducted a laboratory experiment to test our hypotheses. The results demonstrate that there exist positive effects of displaying trust assurances on initial trust. In particular, general trust assurances perform better when displayed in the information-searching stage, while specific trust assurances lead to higher initial trust when displayed in the choice stage. In the context of providing trust assurances, consumers' knowledge of trust assurances exerts a direct and positive effect on initial trust.

Survey responses of 308 managers from a wide spectrum of manufacturing firms have been validated and analyzed by means of structural equation modelling. The findings indicate that dimensions of e-maintenance technology readiness in manufacturing firms are mainly influenced by technological and organizational determinants involving technological infrastructure and competence, expected benefits and challenges of e-maintenance, and firm size and ownership. Surprisingly, there is no significant effect of competitive pressures on e-maintenance readiness. This study offers managers and vendors a frame of reference to analyze firm's situation before initiating new innovations. In case of e-maintenance technology, adoption strategies should be built around fostering level of employees' technological knowledge and skills, technology infrastructure as well as sustaining potential benefits and encountering potential challenges associated with e-maintenance technology.

Many organisations focus on better information organisation and reuse, in an attempt to reduce the costs of testing and manufacturing in the product development phase. Toxicity information is extracted not only from toxicity data but also from predictive models. Accurate and appropriately shared models can bring a number of benefits if we are able to make effective use of existing expertise. Although usage of existing models may provide high-impact insights into the relationships between chemical attributes and specific toxicological effects, they can also be a source of risk for incorrect decisions. Thus, there is a need to provide a framework for efficient model management. To address this gap, this paper introduces a concept of model governance, that is based upon data governance principles. We extend the data governance processes by adding procedures that allow the evaluation of model use and governance for enterprise purposes. The core aspect of model governance is model representation. We propose six rules that form the basis of a model representation schema, called Minimum Information About a QSAR Model Representation (MIAQMR). As a proof-of-concept of our model governance framework we develop a web application called Model and Data Farm (MADFARM), in which models are described by the MIAQMR-ML markup language. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd","Data governance; Information representation; Knowledge management; Model governance; Predictive toxicology; Quality assessment"

However, users became more sensitive to the fact whether the messages include the earthquake relevant keywords or not. This study contributes to the research stream on dynamic patterns of framing messages in that it supplies empirical evidences of pattern changes before and after the outbreak of a disaster. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Disaster; Information sharing; Risk communication; Twitter"

Current literature focuses on the nature of the technology from a technical perspective and its associated benefits to the SME. We seek to make a contribution that builds on the small but growing work, which views investment technology decisions as the outcome of a process of both objective and subjective risk assessment. Evidence presented in this paper suggests that subjective elements play an important part in assessing technology risks. Our empirical findings are that both e-business experience and the role of the decision-maker within the firm influences risk perception, whereas, sector differences are more modest. One implication of our findings is that policy interventions should be more sensitive and targeted at different types of stakeholders - owners, IT professionals and other individuals rather than on the sector in which the SME operates. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","e-Business; Perception of risk; Risk; SME; Survey; Technology"

DHRs usually manage a complex and varied mix of digital heritage objects of different types and formats. They tend to be complex in nature and usually involve complex, simultaneous and intersecting workflows. As a result, DHRs impose implementation challenges on any solutions that aim to manage their workflows. Thus, despite the proliferation of DHRs, it is a noteworthy trend that there is a general lack of workflow management solutions that can be utilized in such systems. As a research area that is rarely covered, this paper therefore presents the design and development of a novel Workflow Management System (WfMS) built to integrate with DHRs specifically, and DLSs in general. In this context, an experimental WfMS aimed to test the validity of workflow management integration with DHRs. The devised WfMS was built as a workflow management solution that can adequately address the specific hurdles imposed by DHR implementations. Additionally, a novel DHR implementation framework called DISPLAYS (Digital Library Services for Playing with Antiquity and Shared Heritage) is presented as a test bed for the proposed WfMS. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Digital heritage; Digital library system; Workflow Management System"

This case study examines two small ICT companies in Vietnam to determine how knowledge transfer was conducted with and without the use of ICT. A knowledge transfer framework for small businesses was used as a lens to analyse the results. The findings showed differences in knowledge transfer approaches in both cases. It was observed that employees whose jobs required less flexibility needed more explicit knowledge, but if their working procedures were more flexible they were more likely to need tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge was mainly transferred by non-ICT methods, with explicit knowledge being transferred via a combination of methods. The cases differed in regard to the existence of knowledge transfer guidelines - as well as the willingness and ability of employees to share knowledge with others in the business. Both case businesses lacked appropriate measures to determine the level of success of knowledge transfer activities. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Case study; ICT; Knowledge management; Small business; Vietnam"

In order to analyze the level of acceptance of this technology, as well as the factors that determine its use by consumers, we have introduced a modification of the classical technological acceptance models (TRA and TAM). Thus, the study proposes and tests an integrated theoretical model, which establishes the relative importance of the key factors (external influences, ease of use, usefulness, attitude, trust and risk) in terms of the acceptance of the mobile payment system in VSN. It also analyzes the eventual moderating effect of users' experience with similar tools. The empirical results show that the proposed behavioral model (named MPAM-VSN) is accordingly adjusted, thus showing that previous experience increases intention of use.

The business orientation of engineer-to-order companies is customer-centric due to the nature of engineer-to-order products, which are tailored and customized according to the specific requirements of each customer. However, this customer orientation may lead to inefficient performance, due to a lack of mechanisms to reuse proven concepts, designs and production facilities, as well as an absence of feedback mechanisms from products in use and service. These challenges have been recognized in earlier empirical research projects conducted in companies providing engineer-to-order products. Based on an exploratory study of the existing literature, this paper aims to identify factors hindering product-related information reuse in an engineering business environment that comprises several networks of actors during the lifecycle of engineer-to-order products. The main challenges of information reuse in an engineer-to-order context are related to reuse situations, which require combining existing information with experience-based knowledge.

Worldwide, several companies scrapped RFID projects because of high resistance from consumers and their advocacy groups - which actually demand RFID-specific privacy policies. This concern is even more acute when RFID is used in public applications; because, in general case, citizens cannot refuse to provide data, and the data collected by a government agency would offer serious threats if are shared among third parties. Limited research has been performed in this specific issue; they all agree that perceived privacy increased RFID acceptance. But, what drives privacy perceptions are yet to be researched - this study closes this research gap. In order to conduct the current research, mixed method of research approach has been adopted. In the qualitative research stage, the authors conducted two focused-group discussion sessions and eight in-depth interviews in two different countries: Australia and Bangladesh; arguing that the status, and the perceptions and tolerance of the citizens on privacy are different in these two regions. The explored factors have been examined with empirical data obtained from these two countries. It is found that, there are distinct differences in perceptions in developed and developing countries. The detail findings offer practical suggestions to the agency managers so that they can ensure better privacy of the citizens. As a significant theoretical contribution, this study enhances existing literature identifying the antecedents of privacy, which play even different roles in different cultural backgrounds. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Business intelligence (BI) systems are designed to deliver decision-support information and have been repeatedly shown to provide value to organizations. Many healthcare organizations have yet to implement BI systems and no existing research provides a healthcare-specific framework to guide implementation. To address this research gap, we employ a case study in a Canadian Health Authority in order to address three questions: (1) what are the most significant adverse impacts to the organization's decision processes and outcomes attributable to a lack of decision-support capabilities? (2) what are the root causes of these impacts, and what workarounds do they necessitate? and (3) in light of the issues identified, what are the key considerations for healthcare organizations in the early stages of BI implementation? Using the concept of co-agency as a guide we identified significant decision-related adverse impacts and their root causes. We found strong management support, the right skill sets and an information-oriented culture to be key implementation considerations. Our major contribution is a framework for defining and prioritizing decision-support information needs in the context of healthcare-specific processes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The research aims to specify any digital marketing skills gaps encountered by professionals working in communication industries. In-depth interviews were undertaken with 20 communication industry professionals. A focus group followed, testing the rigour of the data. We find that a lack of specific technical skills; a need for best practice guidance on evaluation metrics, and a lack of intelligent futureproofing for dynamic technological change and development are skills gaps currently challenging the communication industry. However, the challenge of integrating digital marketing approaches with established marketing practice emerges as the key skills gap. Emerging from the key findings, a Digital Marketer Model was developed, highlighting the key competencies and skills needed by an excellent digital marketer. The research concludes that guidance on best practice, focusing upon evaluation metrics, futureproofing and strategic integration, needs to be developed for the communication industry.

Given its significant role, business integration in general has been an enduring research topic over the years. However, due to its complex nature, the ways to achieve this important organisational capability in firms are still not clearly understood. Hence, the present study is an attempt to 'open this black box' and examine the relevant issues through a case study of M.com, one of the largest e-commerce firms in China. The findings of this case study emphasise that the ability to coordinate organisational interdependencies and asset orchestration according to the needs of business processes is challenging but necessary in order to achieve business integration in e-commerce firms. It is found that asset orchestration in a firm is contingent on the organisational interdependencies such that different interdependence types demand different coordination methods at the very least. It also shows the significant role of IT in asset orchestration and the coordination of organisational interdependencies during business integration. With these capabilities, firms can experience growth and improve the quality of conformance to customer needs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies on information management have identified data availability as a key priority, and the literature on disaster recovery and business continuity describes ways of preparing for and avoiding IT incidents. However, no frameworks for information system continuity management (ISCM) have yet been validated. This research draws on a framework for business continuity management, and extends it to the context of information systems. The framework is validated in a survey of IT managers and chief information officers in large private and public organisations operating in Finland. The results suggest that the embeddedness of continuity practices in an organisation has perceived business impacts whereas, in contradiction of previous theory, there is no such direct relation in the case of organisational alertness and preparedness. The theoretical contribution is to validate the ISCM framework statistically.

Based on surveys, focus groups, and usability studies, our findings suggest that workplace social norms play a pivotal role in the adoption and use of interruption management technologies. Our findings display a marked lag of social norms behind the importance placed on uninterrupted time by individuals; even when individuals see the efficacy of the technology, they often misjudge their peers' attitudes, underestimating their colleagues' similar needs. In spite of high levels of perceived usefulness reported by our participants, need and ease of use alone were insufficient to predict uptake; when technology has implications for the office behavioral environment, it must be supported by social norms encouraging adoption. Our results further suggest that feedback, which actively engages a product's user, could be crucial to encouraging prolonged use and enhancing the user experience. Although the findings are drawn from a pre-commercialization study of an interruption management technology, they are broadly relevant to technology adoption cases, with special salience for those within the office context. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Feedback; Interruption; Productivity; Social norms; Technology adoption"

We review and clarify definitions of shared services and derive a definition applicable for the government context. Based on an extensive literature review, we present an empirically grounded research framework of motives for introducing shared services. We validated this framework in 16 interviews with shared services experts from New Zealand and Dutch government organizations. Achieving back office cost reduction is a major public policy goal in many OECD countries, and shared services models are increasingly promoted as a means for achieving this. However, cost reduction and business management principles derived from the private sector are not the only motivations guiding public sector IT. As organizations realize the difficulties in reducing costs, other motives for using shared services increase in significance: improvement of service delivery, service quality and consistency, exchange of internal capabilities and better access to skilled and external resources. These motives are consistent with a ""New Public Service"" ethos of greater engagement and collaboration. Our findings suggest that trends in public sector IT management and sourcing frequently reflect wider philosophical motivations in public policy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Cost reduction; Government; Public sector; Shared services definition; Shared services motives"

Organizational identity is conceptualized as the mental representation that organizational members have of themselves as a social group in terms of practices, norms, and values and how they understand themselves to be different from members of other organizations. Data analysis suggests that divergent organizational identities and team members' alternative interpretations of others' practices, norms and organizational symbols, coexist during the post-merger integration phase.

From an IS research perspective, one important issue is the strategic role played by the firm's IT capabilities in responding to greater environmental uncertainty and correspondingly greater information requirements, and in enabling the firm's internationalization performance. Given that such a major aspect of the influence of IT on the performance of SMEs has so far been ignored, the following research question is posed: to what extent does the match between the IT capabilities and information requirements of SMEs contribute to their internationalization performance? Our research model and hypotheses are based on Tushman and Nadler's information processing model. In revisiting this model, the aim was to show its continued relevancy and extend its domain of applicability. In order to answer the research question, we conduct a survey-based empirical study of 174 Canadian SMEs that have internationalized their activities. Our results show that a better match between IT capabilities and information requirements does indeed exert a positive influence on internationalization performance. We also find that the SMEs' IT capabilities are influenced externally by the environmental uncertainty and internally by their internationalization mode. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Information management; International performance; Internationalization mode; Strategic alignment"

Students no longer have to seek information; they acquire it passively through their everyday use of the Internet. This paper presents findings of a study involving the information encountering experiences of undergraduate students and the potential role of personal information collection, management, and retrieval in information literacy instruction. Undergraduate students enrolled in an information literacy course were surveyed regarding their experiences online with information encountering and personal information management. Survey questions were adopted from the information encountering scale developed by Wise & Erdelez (2012) and consisted of twelve questions focused on the noticing, stopping, examining, and capturing steps of the Information encountering model (Erdelez, 2004). The study indicates that the vast majority of the undergraduate students responding to the survey were frequently encountering unexpected information while online, but were not capturing this information for future use using built-in, web-based tools. While information literacy courses teach students to identify, seek, analyze, and use needed information, they do not prepare them to manage and retrieve unexpected information encountered while using the Internet. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","ACRL standards; Information encountering; Information literacy; Personal information management; Undergraduate students"

To cope with the limited batteries and computational capacities of mobile devices, prior studies suggest to deploy service instances in clouds for accomplishing most of the computation-intensive tasks. Service composition, which compensates for the simplicity of single service, is an effective way to utilize the plentiful services on the clouds all over the world. In this paper, we focus on the problem of service instance selection with service instance replica limitation constraint. The objective is to select the optimal set of service instances, which composes the integrated service and brings out the optimal QoS (quality of service), in terms of service response time. To characterize the problem, we establish a new QoS model, which considers the comprehensive quality over all users, not just for any single user or service instance. We prove that the problem is NP-hard, since many functionally equivalent service instances spread all over the distributed clouds. To address the problem, we classify the problem into three cases, including two special cases and the general case. We present two effective heuristic algorithms to determine the service instances selection for the two special cases, which are still NP-hard. The two special cases provide empirical bounds for the general case. We propose an algorithm that simulates a vote procedure for the users in the general case. The selected service instances, which come from the vote procedure, can satisfy a majority of users. We conduct extensive simulations for all of the algorithms. The simulation results show that our algorithms work efficiently on service response time reduction. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Cloud computing; Cost efficient; Mobile service; Service composition"

In this study, we attempt to investigate the moderating effect of inconsistent reviews (i.e., a mix of positive and negative reviews) on consumers' purchase decision. We further examine whether the effect will differ from female to male consumers. We explain the moderating effect and its gender differences based on the theory of reasoned action, trust literature, and information processing literature. The research hypotheses are empirically tested in a laboratory experiment using structural equation modeling approach. Our findings show that consumers' cognitive trust to online retailers affects emotional trust, which further leads to purchase intention. When consumers are exposed to inconsistent reviews, the influence of emotional trust on purchase intention is significantly stronger. Moreover, the moderating effect of inconsistent reviews is stronger for female consumers than for male consumers. We expect that this study can enrich the understanding of how inconsistent reviews play a role in consumers' online shopping decision.

A review of existing literature about supply chain visibility reveals that there are two essential forces at work, namely (1) collaborative behavior - i.e., firms willing to share information with supply chain partners in order to leverage social capital, and (2) opportunistic behavior - i.e., firms wanting to maintain some degree of information asymmetry in order to manage the behaviors of their supply chain partners. In order to identify the antecedents of IOS visibility, our operational definition of supply chain visibility, the two theories - resource dependence theory (RDT) and relational view (RV) - are used to cobble together a set of variables in a framework to investigate their relationships to IOS visibility. The data used in this study was collected from 124 intermediate component manufacturers in three different manufacturing industries. The results show that IOS visibility positively influences overall supply chain performance, as measured by operational performance.

On the surface, adopting cloud computing requires a firm to address many of the same concerns they face in adopting any enterprise IT. However, cloud technologies also offer new pricing and deployment strategies that are unavailable in traditional enterprise solutions. It is unclear how previous research frameworks of enterprise IT adoption relate to these new adoption strategies. To bridge this gap in the literature, our study uses the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework of innovation diffusion theory to develop a cloud service adoption model that deals with not only adoption intention, but also pricing mechanisms and deployment models. Our research model has been empirically tested using 200 Taiwanese firms. We found that: (1) Cloud adoption is still at its initial stage, since the adoption rates are very low; (2) the perceived benefits, business concerns, and IT capability within the TOE framework are significant determinants of cloud computing adoption, while external pressure is not; (3) firms with greater IT capability tend to choose the pay-as-you-go pricing mechanism; (4) business concern is the most important factor influencing the choice of deployment model, with higher concerns leading to private deployment options. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Cloud computing; Deployment model; Innovation adoption; Pricing mechanism; TOE framework"

We examine the role of IT as a solution possibility for environmental management and sustainability by analyzing how IT influences environmental performance. We propose a model in which IT influences environmental performance by enabling the integration of IT in environmental management processes. The proposed model is tested by using the variance-based structural equation modeling technique with matched-pair survey data from a sample of 151 Chinese firms. We find that: (1) Firm's proficiency in leveraging IT technical infrastructure flexibility, IT personnel skills and IT-business alignment enables the integration of IT in the environmental management processes to improve environmental performance, and (2) this IT integration is stronger when the firm is more oriented to environmental sustainability. We introduce to information systems community the construct IT-environmental management integration, and we explain theoretically and test empirically the role of IT-environmental management integration as a key mechanism through which IT competence influences environmental performance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Environmental performance; Environmental sustainability; IT competence; IT-environmental management integration"

To understand how researchers have adopted theories, used research constructs, and developed conceptual frameworks in their studies, a systematic and structured literature review based on five leading online academic databases was conducted. A total of 46 articles on social media research were consolidated and analyzed, including empirical studies spanning from 2002 to 2011. A collection of theories/models and constructs/attributes adopted in these articles is summarized and tabulated for easy reference and comprehension of extant research results. A causal-chain framework was developed based on the input-moderator-mediator-output model to illustrate the causality between the research constructs used and the conceptualization of theoretical models/theories proposed by previous researchers. Because social media cover a wide range of research topics, the literature review may not be exhaustive. However, the proposed causal-chain framework and suggested research directions may be regarded as representative references for future research in the subject area.

Regardless of whether this regulation derives from government-sourced guidelines or materials from government-sponsored institutions, it results in a high production of information resources (institutional information resources), which are disseminated to the clinical stuff in order to ensure compliance. In that case, the issue of credibility of these information resources might arise, since medical practice is characterized by a high frequency of change. The latter involves a continuous effort on the part of the clinical staff, which is motivated by work-related factors (e.g., need for compliance) or personal motivation (e.g., need for self-improvement). In this study we consider a simple trust model, according to which we assume that perceived trust is a direct antecedent of perceived credibility. We evaluate whether work-related or personal motivating factors influence the relation between perceived credibility and trust toward institutional information sources and how the effect of each factor affects this relation. Findings suggest that work-related factors have a higher impact on the relation between credibility and trust than personal motivation factors, while they are stressing the important role of hospital libraries as a dissemination point for government-sponsored information resources. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Healthcare; Information exchange; Knowledge worker; Trust"

It is unclear how, and to what extent, existing theories can explain their continued use. As young people constitute the majority of VW users, understanding the reasons for their continued use intentions is important. Taking the distinctive features of VW services into account, such as the visibility of users' actions to other users, we contextualize the Theory of Planned Behavior and investigate the role of teenagers' attitudes, social influences and perceived behavioral control as the determinants of their continued intention to use VW. We then apply a set of constructs from prior Information Systems (IS) literature to decompose these constructs. By analyzing primary data collected from 923 users of Habbo Hotel, a leading virtual world for teenagers, this study confirms the role of users' intrinsic motivation, interpersonal influence and self-efficacy as key constituents of sustained user engagement in VWs. In addition, we demonstrate that decomposing these three established constructs can capture many of the key contextual characteristics of VWs. The study contributes to the literature by showing that IS theories and constructs are appropriate for the VW setting and teenage users. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Continued use; Decomposed theory of planned behavior; Online service; Teenager; Virtual worlds"

Precisely, this paper seeks to shed light on the quantitative perspective, approximating the value of personal information for those companies that base their business model on this new type of asset. In the absence of any systematic research or methodology on the subject, an ad hoc procedure is developed in this paper. It starts with the examination of the accounts of a number of key players in online markets. This inspection first aims to determine whether the value of personal information databases is somehow reflected in the firms' books, and second to define performance measures able to capture this value. After discussing the strengths and weaknesses of possible approaches, the method that performs best under several criteria (revenue per data record) is selected.

The rapid evolution and adoption of big data by industry has leapfrogged the discourse to popular outlets, forcing the academic press to catch up. Academic journals in numerous disciplines, which will benefit from a relevant discussion of big data, have yet to cover the topic. This paper presents a consolidated description of big data by integrating definitions from practitioners and academics. The paper's primary focus is on the analytic methods used for big data. A particular distinguishing feature of this paper is its focus on analytics related to unstructured data, which constitute 95% of big data. This paper highlights the need to develop appropriate and efficient analytical methods to leverage massive volumes of heterogeneous data in unstructured text, audio, and video formats. This paper also reinforces the need to devise new tools for predictive analytics for structured big data. The statistical methods in practice were devised to infer from sample data. The heterogeneity, noise, and the massive size of structured big data calls for developing computationally efficient algorithms that may avoid big data pitfalls, such as spurious correlation. © 2014 The Authors.","Big data analytics; Big data definition; Predictive analytics; Unstructured data analytics"

The findings showed that infrastructure activities lead to all three types of planning whereas core activities lead only to procedures planning. Moreover, they showed that technical planning leads to planning effectiveness whereas personnel and procedures planning do not. The findings suggest that future researchers might try to uncover the reasons that core activities do not lead to more information systems planning.

We synergistically combine the strengths of three IS theories - task technology fit (TTF) model, unified theory of acceptance and usage of technology (UTAUT), and initial trust model (ITM). The model was tested in a study conducted in Portugal, one of the European Union (EU) countries with the highest mobile phone adoption.

The dedication factors of satisfaction and relative advantage of incumbent, as well as the constraint factors of inertia and switching cost significantly influence consumers' intentions to rebuy and continue to use IT products. The constraint factor inertia influences the dedication factor satisfaction.

While existing corporate analyses are often based on numerical financial figures, relatively little work has been done to reveal from textual news articles factors that represent BI. In this research, we developed BizPro, an intelligent system for extracting and categorizing BI factors from news articles. BizPro consists of novel text mining procedures and BI factor modeling and categorization. Expert guidance and human knowledge (with high inter-rater reliability) were used to inform system development and profiling of BI factors. We conducted a case study of using the system to profile BI factors of four major IT companies based on 6859 sentences extracted from 231 news articles published in major news sources. The results show that the chosen techniques used in BizPro - Naïve Bayes (NB) and Logistic Regression (LR) - significantly outperformed a benchmark technique. NB was found to outperform LR in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, and area under ROC curve. This research contributes to developing a new system for profiling company BI factors from news articles, to providing new empirical findings to enhance understanding in BI factor extraction and categorization, and to addressing an important yet under-explored concern of BI analysis. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","BI factor extraction; Business intelligence; Categorization; Online news; Profiling"

Thus, this paper fills the gap by examining the mediating role of identification trust and affective commitment on members' continuous knowledge sharing intention within business online communities. 220 experienced online community members participated in the web survey. Structural equation modelling technique is used to analyze the data together with Baron and Kenny's (1986) mediating analysis procedure. The research findings reveal that, besides user's level of satisfaction, continuous knowledge sharing intention is partially mediated by affective commitment and identification trust. This paper ends by providing some insights on how to encourage continuous knowledge sharing intention within business online communities from the perspective of commitment-trust theory. Understanding the determinants of this behaviour is important as it helps to build an active community and also provides the opportunities for consumers to channel their ideas and suggestions in co-creating the products in which they are interested in. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Business online communities; Commitment-trust theory; Continuous knowledge sharing; Information systems continuous use model"

Employing the Means-End Chain (MEC) approach, empirical evidence was obtained through in-depth interviews with online shoppers using laddering technique to determine the most frequently mentioned attributes from four servicescape dimensions: (1) ambient; (2) design; (3) signs, symbols and artifacts; and (4) interaction. Accordingly, we laddered three levels of online shoppers' responses from concrete to less concrete abstractions, i.e. attributes, benefits, and end-desirable beliefs. As a result, seven salient e-servicescape attributes were identified. Each of the four dimensions suggests the attributes' linkage to benefits and end-desirable beliefs. Specifically, the study finds quality photograph, as the salient attribute of the ambient dimension, may set the point of initial attraction and move shoppers from understanding the product to linking the web site contents. In the design dimension, navigation bar, categorization, and simple arrangement are the salient attributes. Company logo represents the most salient attribute under the signs, symbols and artifacts dimension because it not only facilitates recognition and recall of prominent web sites, it also acts as the determinant of perceived risks. In the interaction dimension, although pricing information is the salient attribute that evokes happiness and confidence among online shoppers, it may dilute their perception on web site's success. Instead, confirmation mail can possibly act as a determinant to web site's success. By offering a finer granularity of information, our findings provide insights to online sellers on the salient attributes to consider in order to effectively promote their shopping web sites to create positive emotional response and buying behavior among the online shoppers. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","e-Servicescape; Laddering technique; MEC approach; Qualitative study; Salient attribute; Shopping web site"

Using the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power disaster as a case study this paper examines the impact of information behaviours on information failure, taking into account Affective Load Theory, Face Threat Theory and Escalation Theory. Content/Discourse analysis was carried out on four major reports on the Fukushima disaster, employing the constant comparison method of analysis to develop and explore categories representing different views of the actors involved. The findings revealed that an escalation of commitment to a 'myth of nuclear safety' occurred over the lifetime of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. This escalation ingrained information avoiding and ignoring behaviours in the Japanese nuclear industry, from the electric companies themselves to the local population living near nuclear power plants, allowing safety standards to fall, leaving Fukushima Daiichi vulnerable to threats such as earthquakes and tsunamis. A framework was developed explaining how escalating commitment interacts with information behaviour exhibited by the key actors in the situation. It is concluded that information avoiding behaviours were a major factor in the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. These, influenced by barriers created by an escalation of commitment to the 'myth of nuclear safety', resulted in a catastrophic information failure. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Affective Load Theory; Escalation Theory; Face Threat Theory; Fukushima disaster; Information failure"

Despite this promising trend, health care sector has not fully embraced RFID technology. The purpose of this study is to understand how RFID technology can be beneficial for meeting hospital real time asset and people management information requirements prior to adoption of the technology. Data collected from 81 operation directors shows that the hospital real time information requirements are significantly linked to perceived efficiency and patient satisfaction benefits of RFID. Furthermore, causal path analysis shows that the RFID enablers of staff capabilities/readiness for technology and investment in information systems (IS) contribute to the perceived efficiency and patient satisfaction benefits of RFID. Among the barriers not implementing RFID technology, cost is found the most significant. The significant association between hospital information requirements and perceived benefits of RFID technology shows that if hospital needs are understood, user acceptance of AIDC is likely. Moreover, staff readiness for technology and investment in IS prior to RFID adoption plays a significant role in how hospitals can benefit from RFID. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Efficiency; Healthcare; Patient satisfaction; RFID; User requirements"

This type of organizations poses complex problems for information and knowledge management due to the fragmentation and lack of uniformity of organizational structures, processes, practices, and technologies. The ineffectiveness of knowledge sharing over time, between project teams, is perhaps the most prominent issue that PBO must deal with. This strongly affects organizational learning, which seems to under-deliver value to PBO. Therefore, relevant knowledge is trapped in an ""informational limbo"" out of reach, not being capitalized for the organization. This is particularly true in research and development (R&D) institutions, where knowledge sharing can be hindered by conceptual misunderstandings resulting from different disciplines, cultures and ways of working of project participants. This paper addresses such issues by analyzing, in a comprehensive way, how information and knowledge management can better suit project team's needs and at the same time improve organizational learning. An ethnographic study, based on immersed participant observation, is performed at a Portuguese R&D Institute, in order to understand the link between the way information is managed in a project and how people interact and learn by sharing knowledge between projects. Results provide a set of enterprise information management (EIM) recommendations. Findings also suggest that a PBO-wide EIM strategy, balancing knowledge codification and personalization mechanisms, is a feasible solution to overcome the problems of knowledge sharing in PBO. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Information management; Knowledge management; Knowledge sharing; Organizational learning; Project-based organizations"

The hypotheses are tested in a sample of 510 German-speaking MCS users. PLS analysis reveals that the constructs associated most strongly with the willingness criterion are IR price knowledge, expected risks of separated IR services (e.g., low savings, inaccurate bills) and expected ease of switching to unbundled IR offerings.

However, there are theoretical reasons to postulate that the perceived risk acts as a barrier to consumer trust. Furthermore, existing studies suggest that trust is an important predictor of purchase intention. Thus, this research aims at investigating the mediating role of consumer trust in an online merchant in the relationships between components of perceived risk and purchase intention: (1) examining the total effect without mediation, and (2) examining the mediation effect. When we probed the total effect, the findings revealed that performance, psychological, financial, and online payment risks have a significant negative influence on purchase intention. On the other hand, an examination of the mediation effect indicated that trust in an online merchant completely mediates the effect of performance risk, but partially mediates that of the psychological risk. Given the mixture of unmediated as well as mediated effect of perceived risks on purchase intention, the paper concludes that efforts, made by online merchants, to lessen certain types of risk will first improve consumer trust, and then ultimately, increase consumer's intention to buy online. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In a Relationship-based culture, information is managed to encourage communication, participation, and a sense of identity. In a Risk-taking culture, information is managed to encourage innovation, creativity, and the exploration of new ideas.

Data were collected from an online survey wherein subjects were encouraged to reflect on recent service failure experiences. The results from testing a structural equation model indicate that distributive and interactional justice contribute significantly to customer satisfaction and, in turn, to complaint intentions, but procedural justice does not.

Hence, in order to increase efficiency and effectiveness, many libraries are moving towards automation of the majority of their activities. Libraries are deploying Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology as a substitute for barcode systems for item identification and tracking, and this ultimately enables the automation of the majority of their processes. It is apparent from the available literature that research on RFID-related issues is largely concentrated on technical, organizational and implementation aspects, and less attention has been paid to understanding the use and user-satisfaction aspects. Therefore, this article aims to understand factors affecting the use of RFID systems and user satisfaction in a library context by empirically testing relevant constructs from DeLone and McLean's IS Success Model. A questionnaire-based survey was employed to collect data from a total of 181 respondents, who were all active users of an RFID-based library system. The findings from this study suggest that factors like system quality, use and user satisfaction positively influence consumer attitudes towards RFID-enabled services.

While the challenge in assessing economic returns from exhibitions is being studied, it is agreed that the eventual success of an exhibition resides largely in its ability to meet the visitors' needs. Visitors use an exhibition as a source of information when searching for products or services. Though an exhibition provides an information-rich environment, however, visitors often get lost in the abundance of information. A specialized recommender system can be a good solution to information overload as it can guide visitors to right exhibition booths and help them collect necessary information. Traditional collaborative-filtering recommender systems, however, use only customers' rating or purchase records so that they do not capture exhibition visitors' temporal visit sequences and dynamic preferences. Moreover, due to the computation overhead, they cannot generate real-time recommendation in ubiquitous environments for exhibitions. In order to overcome these drawbacks, this study proposes a booth recommendation procedure that takes into consideration not only booth visit records but also visit sequences. Experiment results show that the proposed procedure achieves higher recommendation accuracy, faster computation, and more diversity than a typical collaborative-filtering recommender system.

Due to a multitude of users, such spaces generate large amounts of content, thus creating a potential for information overload. To deal with it, users of online shared spaces develop information management strategies that frequently involve the use of information technology. In this paper we present a case study of the use of widgets as information management tools in uCern, an online shared workspace where healthcare industry stakeholders get involved in various types of interactions. To understand how widgets served the purpose of information management and whether they were considered useful, we administered an online questionnaire (n = 183) followed by qualitative interviews (n = 5). Data analysis revealed that study participants used widgets as tools that promoted their situation and activity awareness of events and activities going on in uCern and helped them with organizing and accessing the content in a quick and efficient manner. We also describe issues associated with the use of widgets and their usefulness as reported by participants and propose implications for design and development of online shared spaces in relation to information management tools. © 2012","Awareness; Information management; Online shared spaces"

Specifically, this study examines how firms bundle infrastructure capability and customer orientation to enhance the quality of customer information that enhances customer relationships and firm performance. The results of data gathered from 116 financial service firms in Taiwan suggest that the impact of quality on firm performance begins with infrastructure capability and customer orientation, and that the complementarity between these factors positively influences customer information quality. The results indicate that customer information quality positively affects customer relationship performance, which consequently leads to improvements in overall firm performance. © 2013","CRM systems; Customer information quality; Customer orientation; Infrastructure capability"

It is evident that the nature within any crisis is unpredictable, erratic and difficult to prevent. Organizations are therefore preparing for unexpected events by outlining their crisis response strategies. The fact that crises may not repeat themselves and a given crisis solution might not be directly applicable to another crisis represents radical shifts in routines. As such, an organization may have to improvise when putting together a set of resources and capabilities for a response. This case study complements existing crisis management research that emphasizes both prevention and response by focusing on how an organization may adapt and deploy resources and capabilities accordingly. To meet the objective, the research draws upon an in-depth case study of Singapore's response tothe Asian Tsunami disaster in 2004.

This article elaborates on the most important risks inherent to the cloud such as information security, regulatory compliance, data location, investigative support, provider lock-in and disaster recovery. We focus on risk and control analysis in relation to a sample of Swiss companies with regard to their prospective adoption of public cloud services. We observe a sufficient degree of risk awareness with a focus on those risks that are relevant to the IT function to be migrated to the cloud. Moreover, the recommendations as to the adoption of cloud services depend on the company's size with larger and more technologically advanced companies being better prepared for the cloud.

However, more software projects are using the spiral development life cycle model. Software developers and project managers can easily forget about adapting security measures. The spiral model uses iterative steps that can create changes in each phase of software development process. This will challenge security to ensure the application has few flaws or vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Failure to impose the right security measures at each of these phases can open up vulnerabilities for hackers to exploit and prove costly in patching. This paper will explore areas where security can be engaged within each iteration step of the spiral development model.

Yet implementation has often proved to be difficult and the factors which are critical to success are not yet well understood. In this paper existing research in the area of critical success factors (CSFs) is examined and it is suggested that that research actually covers two distinct phenomena. One approach is focused on identifying the factors required for a specific individual to achieve their outcomes. The second on determining the general success factors for implementing a project of a certain type. A reconciliation of the two approaches is proposed within a framework that distinguishes between three different types of CSF – outcome, implementation process and operating environment characteristic. A case study of a project to implement shared services in the Australian public sector is examined using the reconciled framework. The case shows that the reconciled approach by including, and differentiating between, outcome, process and operating environment characteristic factors provides a richer and more complete picture of requirements. Further benefits from the synthesis are also highlighted including that factors are a mix of universal and context specific, different perspectives on factors exist and not all environmental factors perceived to be critical have to necessarily be present. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd","Case study; Critical success factors; Decision making; E-government; Shared services"

To address this gap in the extant literature, the theory of organizational justice is used to explore the extent to which perceived fairness in buyer-supplier relationships supports or inhibits supplier engagement with the CRM process. The rationale is that suppliers who feel fairly treated by key retail customers are more likely to invest resources in the acquisition and use of data central to the retailer's CRM strategy. By empirically testing a conceptual model linking downstream CRM to upstream SRM, the results provide evidence to indicate that customer data use is significantly influenced by perceptions of fairness, particularly with respect to the distribution of rewards, and the transparency of decision-making processes. As a key criticism of CRM centers upon the failure of organizations to exploit the full potential of customer data, the results highlight the usefulness of understanding the relational linkages between buyers and suppliers and the consequential behavior of suppliers in terms of engagement with customer data vital to the success of retailers' CRM strategies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","CRM; Fairness; Loyalty card; Supermarkets; Suppliers"

This can reduce productivity and performance, hinder learning and innovation, affect decision making and well-being and cost organisations large amounts of money. This paper develops a new theory-based model of factors affecting information overload and provides a formula for calculating the extent of overload, potentially of use as a diagnostic tool supporting individual or organisational development. Two methods for categorising factors that contribute to the overload phenomena are introduced. The first method separates those factors based on their direct or indirect effect on information overload, called intrinsic and extraneous factors respectively. The second method divides factors based on whether or not the factor increases or decreases information overload likelihood and tags those factors in terms of 'For' or 'Against'. These new methods for categorisation not only assisted in the development of the conceptual model and in creating the formula, but could be used in other aspects of information overload research, such as finding and evaluating countermeasures to information overload.

To satisfy their information requirements, effective information sharing within and among LGAs is necessary. Nevertheless, the dilemma of Inter-Organisational Information Sharing (IOIS) has been regarded as an inevitable issue for the public sector. Despite a decade of active research and practice, the field lacks a comprehensive framework to examine the factors influencing Electronic Information Sharing (EIS) among LGAs. The research presented in this paper contributes towards resolving this problem by developing a conceptual framework of factors influencing EIS in Government-to-Government (G2G) collaboration. By presenting this model, we attempt to clarify that EIS in LGAs is affected by a combination of environmental, organisational, business process, and technological factors and that it should not be scrutinised merely from a technical perspective. To validate the conceptual rationale, multiple case study based research strategy was selected. From an analysis of the empirical data from two case organisations, this paper exemplifies the importance (i.e. prioritisation) of these factors in influencing EIS by utilising the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique. The intent herein is to offer LGA decision-makers with a systematic decision-making process in realising the importance (i.e. from most important to least important) of EIS influential factors. This systematic process will also assist LGA decision-makers in better interpreting EIS and its underlying problems.

This study shows that these attitudes persist despite increasing frequency of use and increased functionality of mobile phones in the smart phone era. Consumers perceive their mobile device to be for personal communication, and prefer to be able to exercise control over their interaction with organisations. Findings suggest that acceptance can be enhanced by permission marketing, trust-building, creating a sense of being in control, and useful and entertaining website content. Accordingly, pull technologies seem to hold particular promise for mobile marketing communications. This study, therefore, proceeds to explore use of and attitudes towards an important pull technology, QR codes. QR codes, two-dimensional bar codes, can be scanned to provide access to websites, information and applications. Despite their potential, uptake is low. Users in this study who had scanned a QR code had used them to access a variety of different content on different types of items and in different locations. The most frequently accessed type of content was information on a web site, the two most common locations for a scanned QR code were a newspaper or magazine advert, or outdoor advert or poster, and the two most common locations at which scanning was performed were in the street and at home.

The most prevalent perspective presented in the available literature is that the knowledge incentive mechanisms must have the ability to manage the flow of business knowledge. This study explores the relationship among knowledge incentive mechanisms, knowledge psychological ownership, and individual knowledge creation behavior. This study uses structural equation modeling to test a sample of R&D professionals from high-tech companies in Taiwan. Data analysis suggests that knowledge incentive mechanisms promote the psychological ownership by the knowledge owner so that he or she actively carries out knowledge innovation. This implies that knowledge incentive mechanisms stress private proprietary characteristics employees who possess real ownership when they innovate will deem such innovation as an extension of self, giving rise to a protective or defensive mindset, which then has an impact on individual knowledge creation behaviors because of the psychological ownership of knowledge. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We then employed a method based on the two-factor theory in order to classify the SaaS market into adoption-driving and adoption-inhibiting areas. From the adoption-driving area perspective, the results of the method demonstrate the validity of the consumerization phenomenon and the PEST analysis. Customer factors in the consumerization phenomenon and economic factors in the PEST analysis were the most important drivers of SaaS adoption. From the adoption-inhibiting area perspective, customer factors as well as supplier and environment factors inhibited SaaS adoption; according to the PEST analysis, social, economic and political factors inhibited SaaS adoption.

However, the issue of missing data in Management Information Systems (MIS) literature has been overlooked, unlike the case in other disciplines such as Psychology, Marketing, Statistics, and Operations Management. The aim of this paper is to narrow this gap in the MIS field by investigating how MIS researchers address issues of missing data. This paper briefly outlines the causes of missing data in survey-based research as well as the common remedial techniques available to researchers. The paper also reviews how the common statistical software programs namely PASW (SPSS), SAS, LISREL, AMOS, EQS, and PLS handle missing data. It summarizes the common missing data remedial techniques and procedures and outlines how the presence of missing data affect sample size, statistical power, parameter estimates, ability to cope with different missing data patterns, and ease of implementation. Following that is a review of 749 survey-based research articles published between 1990 and 2010 in nine mainstream MIS Journals. The results reveal that researchers rarely report, explicitly, the presence or treatment of missing data and that when they do - they tend to use the least accurate techniques of listwise and pairwise deletion. The research concludes with recommendations that include a call for editorial policies that encourage the reporting of missing data, the reporting of the chosen missing data treatment techniques as well as the justifications for the techniques adopted by the researchers. The authors assert, based on the research, that following these recommendations will affect the rigor and quality of MIS survey-based research. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In most existing routing protocols, the participation of nodes in the routing process is taken as granted. However, in reality, nodes can be unwilling to participate. We first show in this paper the impact of the unwillingness of nodes to participate in existing routing protocols through a set of experiments. Results show that in the presence of even a small proportion of nodes that do not forward messages, performance is heavily degraded. We then analyze two major reasons of the unwillingness of nodes to participate, i.e., their rational behavior (also called selfishness) and their wariness of disclosing private mobility information. Our main contribution in this paper is to survey the existing related research works that overcome these two issues. We provide a classification of the existing approaches for protocols that deal with selfish behavior. We then conduct experiments to compare the performance of these strategies for preventing different types of selfish behaviors.

Despite the growing role of network externalities in SNS continuance decisions, the SNS usage literature has paid scant attention to the relationship between network externalities, SNS identification, and users’ subjective well-being. In this study, we identify four components of network externalities: perceived network size, external prestige, compatibility, and complementarity. In the research model, both network size and external prestige are hypothesized positively to affect SNS identification. Perceived compatibility and perceived complementarity are hypothesized positively to affect user satisfaction. Satisfaction and SNS identification are hypothesized positively to affect user subjective well-being and loyalty towards the SNS. Users’ subjective well-being is hypothesized positively to affect their loyalty towards the SNS. Data collected from 615 valid users of Facebook provide strong support for most of these hypotheses. The findings indicate that perceived network size negatively affects users’ SNS identifications.

To enhance their management decision-making capability, many organizations have made significant investments in business intelligence (BI) systems. The realization of business benefits from BI investments depends on supporting effective use of BI systems and satisfying their end user requirements. Even though a lot of attention has been paid to the decision-making benefits of BI systems in practice, there is still a limited amount of empirical research that explores the nature of end-user satisfaction with BI systems. End-user satisfaction and system usage have been recognized by many researchers as critical determinants of the success of information systems (IS). As an increasing number of companies have adopted BI systems, there is a need to understand their impact on an individual end-user's performance. In recent years, researchers have considered assessing individual performance effects from IS use as a key area of concern. Therefore, this study aims to empirically test a framework identifying the relationships between end-user computing satisfaction (EUCS), system usage, and individual performance. Data gathered from 330 end users of BI systems in the Taiwanese electronics industry were used to test the relationships proposed in the framework using the structural equation modeling approach. The results provide strong support for our model. Our results indicate that higher levels of EUCS can lead to increased BI system usage and improved individual performance, and that higher levels of BI system usage will lead to higher levels of individual performance. In addition, this study's findings, consistent with DeLone and McLean's IS success model, confirm that there exists a significant positive relationship between EUCS and system usage. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis finds the progression to have consisted of a sequence of three major organizational changes, where each change was characterized by a morphogenetic cycle of three phases - Structural and Cultural Conditioning, Socio-Cultural Interactions, and Structural and Cultural Elaboration. In the first phase of each change cycle, structural and cultural outcomes of antecedent cycles conditioned the context as perceived by managerial actors. In the second phase, these conditioning factors interacted with the organization's prevailing socio-cultural dynamics to influence managerial decisions and to effect change. Finally, in the third phase, the emergent consequences of their decisions further altered the structural and cultural landscape, thus conditioning the context for the subsequent change cycle. While the specific organizational mechanisms activated varied from one cycle to the next, the overall analysis collectively revealed the company's quest for more effective vendor relationships. It was seen to have struggled with inconsistencies in its view of a captive vendor's role in the first cycle, and a lack of standard processes with multiple vendors in the second cycle, before establishing closer, comprehensive, successful relationships with two vendors in the third cycle. These findings serve to validate the utility of the morphogenetic analytical framework in uncovering change factors unique to specific offshoring contexts. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This is particularly true in academic organizations, which have the generation and dissemination of knowledge as their principal mission. This research assesses whether path-dependency exists in relation to cultural expectations of knowledge generation and sharing in knowledge intensive organizations. This paper adopts a constructivist approach facilitated by focus group discussions which were conducted in two UK universities, one Russell group university and the other a post-1992. Institutional culture and path dependency play a major role in the willingness of institutions to generate and share knowledge. Each institution exemplified a distinct path-dependency that underpinned cultural expectations but in each case internal and external factors were necessitating changes regarding knowledge sharing and generation which affected individual perspectives and organizational structures. The paper concludes by purporting that certain universities display critical junctures and cultural transformation in terms of knowledge generation, dissemination and sharing. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Critical junctures; Institutional culture; Knowledge generation; Knowledge sharing; Path dependency"

While previous research has suggested that consumers' perceived value and moral judgment are two main factors influencing behavioral intention to purchase online content services, few studies have explored what drives perceived value and if customers' ethical self-efficacy will moderate the effect of perceived value on purchase intention. Thus, based on the value-based adoption model and previous literature, this study explores the antecedents of perceived value and the moderating effect of ethical self-efficacy for online piracy (ESEOP) on the relationship between perceived value and purchase intention in the context of online content services. Data collected from 124 respondents in Taiwan are tested against the research model using the partial least squares (PLS) approach. The results indicate that perceived enjoyment, perceived usefulness, perceived fee, and ESEOP have a significant influence on perceived value and that ESEOP can enhance the positive effect of perceived value on purchase intention. The findings of this study provide several important theoretical and practical implications for consumer online content purchase behaviors. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Ethical self-efficacy for online piracy; Online content services; Perceived value; Purchase intention; Value-based adoption model"

Through an empirical study involving 621 participants, several key findings are obtained. First, online comments have a significant effect on post-crisis reactions involving emotions, attitudes and behavioral intentions. However, except in the case of perceived comment manipulation, public reaction patterns associated with overwhelmingly positive and non-overwhelmingly positive comments are not significantly different and are friendlier to the crisis organization than the other three patterns. Moreover, reactions associated with the pattern in which there are no online comments are quite similar to those associated with the pattern of non-overwhelmingly negative comments. Second, positive emotions enhance perceived organizational integrity, whereas negative emotions reduce this perception. Third, perceived comment manipulation has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between positive emotion and perceived organizational integrity and a positive moderating effect on the relationship between negative emotion and perceived organizational integrity. Finally, emotions and perceived organizational integrity are found to be predictors of loyalty and boycott intentions. The findings of the study extend the present knowledge on crisis communication by highlighting the impact of online comments on the post-crisis reactions of the public and also provide crisis managers with guidelines on how to deploy appropriate crisis communication strategies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd","Crisis communication; Online comment; Public reaction"

An important indicator of website popularity (and consequent survival) is the extent to which the website can draw consumer visits vis-à-vis other websites. A majority of the current understanding on consumer visits is limited to a single website, and leaves little knowledge on the performance of one website compared with others. In tracking the Internet usage behavior of 200 individuals in Mainland China for 30 consecutive days, we applied Zipf's law to identify the divergence points separating popular websites from non-popular ones. Two measurements were used, namely, visit traffic (number) and visit engagement (time spent). We observed that 94.87% of the entire visit traffic is devoted to 15.08% of all visited websites, whereas 84.63% of engagements are on the top 6.16% visited websites. These findings suggest that few websites accounted for the bulk of online traffic and time. Further, we segmented the dataset based on two key proxy variables of user demographics, which are gender and occupation. The findings on visit traffic remained salient after considering user segments, but the findings on website engagement varied across different user segments. Our further analysis, which categorized the visited websites by their main service, revealed the type of Internet users attracted to popular websites. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We collected data from 143 client companies of IT outsourcing and analyzed it using the PLS method. Our findings show that both contract specification and relationship strength significantly influence governance effectiveness, although contract specification carries the more effect on governance effectiveness than relationship strength does. The governance effectiveness in turn mediates the effect of contract specification and relationship strength on three sub-dimensions of outsourcing performance: cost efficiency, performance improvement, and overall satisfaction.

The results indicate that different eLAB system implementation strategies were systematically related to changes in hospitals' relative productivity levels over the years studied. Hospitals that partially implemented an eLAB system without completing the roll-out experienced negative impacts on productivity. The greatest loss in short-term productivity was experienced by facilities that moved from having no eLAB system to a complete implantation in one year - a strategy called the ""Big Bang"". The hybrid approach of a limited introduction in one period followed by complete roll-out in the next year was the only eLAB system implementation strategy associated with significant productivity gains.

The managers of online group-buying firms seek to increase customer purchasing intentions in the face of competition. Online group-buying refers to a certain number of consumers who join together as a group via Internet, for the purpose of buying a certain product with a discount. This study explores antecedents of intention to participate in online group-buying and the relationship between intention and behavior. The research model is basaed on planned behavior theory, electronic word-of-mouth, network embeddedness, and website quality attitude. An online survey is administered to 373 registered members of the ihergo website. Data is analyzed using the partial least squares method, and analytical results demonstrate that for potential consumers, experiential electronic word-of-mouth, relational embeddedness of the initiator, and service quality attitude influence intention to engage in online group-buying; for current consumers, intention to attend online group-buying is determined by the structural and relational embeddedness of the initiator, system quality attitude positively affects intention, and intention positively affects online group-buying behavior. This study proposes a new classification of electronic word-of-mouth and applies the perspective of network embeddedness to explore antecedents of intention in online group-buying, broadening the applicability of electronic word-of-mouth and embeddedness theory.

To address this research gap, this study combines a multilevel approach and an optimal network configuration view to investigate the multilevel effects of social capital on individuals' knowledge sharing in knowledge intensive work teams. This study makes a distinction between the social capital at the team-level and that of social capital at the individual level to examine their cross-level and direct effects on an individual's sharing of explicit and tacit knowledge. A survey involving 343 participants in 47 knowledge-intensive teams was conducted for testing the multilevel model. The results reveal that social capital at both levels jointly influences an individual's explicit and tacit knowledge sharing. Further, when individuals possess a moderate betweenness centrality and the whole team holds a moderate network density, team members' knowledge sharing can be maximized. These findings offer a more comprehensive and precise understanding of the multilevel impacts of social capital on team members' knowledge sharing behavior, thus contributing to the social capital theory, as well as knowledge management research and practices. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Our findings suggest that a full capitalization of the efficiencies created by modularity may be closely linked to the strategic sense making abilities of senior managers to assess the long-term business value of the dominant designs available in the market.

Taking the perspective of the brand community building plus the brand trust and loyalty literatures, our goal is to show how brand communities based on social media influence elements of the customer centric model (i.e., the relationships among focal customer and brand, product, company, and other customers) and brand loyalty. A survey-based empirical study with 441 respondents was conducted. The results of structural equation modeling show that brand communities established on social media have positive effects on customer/product, customer/brand, customer/company and customer/other customers relationships, which in turn have positive effects on brand trust, and trust has positive effects on brand loyalty. We find that brand trust has a fully mediating role in converting the effects of enhanced relationships in brand community to brand loyalty.

Thus many have flocked to put surveys, experiments, and other data collection measures online in an attempt to gather empirical evidence in a variety of fields. While some choose a commercial provider to host surveys or experiments, others require the additional flexibility that comes with creating and maintaining a custom server. Herein lies a crucial problem: Most researchers lack the skills necessary to design, implement, and manage a server end-to-end. To overcome this limitation, they often hire programmers and administrators, who while usually competent, are not ultimately accountable to granting agencies funding research or Institutional Review Boards overseeing the research. This puts the researcher in a position of accountability in data security, confidentiality, and privacy concerns. The goal of the present paper is to outline a typical server setup, and highlight issues pertaining to data security in language accessible to researcher. This paper also presents data collected and analyzed from an anonymous distributed survey asking researchers questions assessing their management of research data. Our findings from the responses confirmed the legitimacy of our concerns by demonstrating the evident need for stricter security measures in research settings.

It builds on justice and service marketing theories, and examines key factors that drive intentions to continue using web-based live-chat support services and to provide positive word-of-mouth. The results suggest that these outcomes are increased through interactional justice perceptions, which are diminished by the perceived busyness of the service provider. It is also suggested that the latter effect is moderated by the duration of the live-chat session; when the session is long the effect is stronger.

Such organisational forms with their inherent complexity require specific approaches for their IT management within. Especially important for unleashing the chances of networked arrangements is the right form of IT Governance. Choosing the right arrangement for IT Governance is heavily dependent on understanding the concepts on which such business constellations are built. In this paper we provide therefore first a systematically derived, graph-based perspective on the key terms of inter-organisational collaboration. Based on this understanding of concepts and structured representations of inter-organisational dependencies we present interorganisational governance practices for IT. Specifically, we assign accountabilities to top executive roles from both IT and business.

However, the use of social media is fundamentally different from that of traditional information technologies. Specifically, it requires collective efforts and interdependence between two or more people, and thus the usage behavior is no longer an individual's own decision or plan. Built on critical mass theory and social influence processes, this study tries to make an attempt to understand the determinants of collective intention (we-intention), which represents one's perception of a group of people acting as a unit. Instant messaging, one of the most popular social media platforms, has been chosen for investigation, and findings from a survey showed that perceived critical mass influenced we-intention both directly and indirectly through group norm and social identity. Recognizing the importance and relevance of collective intention will advance current understanding beyond individual intention-based models which are widely adopted in prior IS research.

Objectives The overall aim of this work is to provide a body of knowledge for enabling successful KT in GSD settings. This is achieved by an in-depth understanding of KT challenges and mitigation strategies, both from the perspective of literature and industry. It also identifies the similarities and differences in challenges and strategies gathered from literature studies and industrial experts. Methods In order to fulfill the aim of the research, we collected data through a systematic literature review (SLR) and conducted interviews with industrial experts. Through the SLR we found 35 primary studies relevant to our objectives. We also conducted eight interviews of experienced industrial professionals from eight different multinational companies world-wide. For analyzing the data we used grounded theory and cross-case analysis. Results In total, 60 different challenges and 79 unique mitigation strategies are identified from both SLR and interview results. The challenges and mitigation strategies are grouped into three core categories of personnel, project and technology factors, thus giving rise to a conceptualization called as 2PT factors. There are greater numbers of challenges and mitigation strategies in the project and personnel factors, highlighting the complex interplay of project-related and human-intensive issues in GSD projects, while the technology factor plays the role as facilitator in transferring knowledge. The study also maps the mitigation strategies to challenges, which can guide practitioners in their selection of strategies to use for overcoming KT challenges in GSD. Conclusions We conclude that effective management of project and personnel factors, facilitated by technological factors, are crucial for a successful transfer of knowledge in GSD projects. Thus in future, the researchers and practitioners need to focus on the 2PT factors for ensuring effective KT in GSD settings. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd","Global software development; Interviews; Knowledge transfer; Systematic literature review"

In such an organisational setting, the harmonisation of Information Technology (IT) operations, integration of cross-departmental processes and the underlying Information Systems (IS) signifies a challenge in delivering integrated services. This paper attempts to explore enterprise application integration (EAI) adoption in the UK local government authorities (LGAs). Despite the hype of EAI adoption in private domain, its application in LGAs is inadequate as there is a lack of adoption models/frameworks that can be used by the public sector. The context of the study is to consider the transformation of IT infrastructure management and operations with EAI technologies. The empirical findings, generated through a detailed case analysis, manifestly exemplify that EAI predominantly acts as a 'back-office' technology that facilitates operations by developing a flexible and maintainable integrated IT infrastructure. Our proposed framework is believed to be imperative and unique as it provides a more systematic way to examine the adoption of integration technologies, extends the established norms for EAI adoption by utilising a prioritisation technique to classify the importance of factors. The contribution of the research extends the literature on EAI and identifies theoretical and practical opportunities that facilitate LGAs in their decision-making process to produce more robust proposals for EAI adoption. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Adoption lifecycle phases; EAI; Integration; IT infrastructure operations; LGA; Mapping; Prioritisation"

S-commerce is a subset of e-commerce and uses SNSs for social interactions and user contributions to facilitate the online buying and selling of various products and services. Recent years have witnessed the rapid growth of s-commerce in Korea, but this growth has involved a number of transaction-related issues such as no delivery and the delivery of wrong items. In particular, consumers’ trust has become a crucial factor in the success of s-commerce firms, requiring these firms to make more effort to gain this trust. In this regard, this study identifies the key factors in s-commerce [reputation, size, information quality, transaction safety, communication, economic feasibility, and word-of-mouth (WOM) referrals], that is, the characteristics of s-commerce influencing Korean consumers’ trust in s-commerce. In addition, the study assesses the effects of trust on trust performance (purchase intentions and WOM intentions). The results of an empirical analysis based on a sample of 371 s-commerce users indicate that all the characteristics of s-commerce (except for economic feasibility) had significant effects on trust and that trust had significant effects on purchase and WOM intentions. The results have important implications for s-commerce firms wishing to develop a successful business model for providing their customers with trustworthy services. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd","Purchase intentions; Social commerce; Trust; Trust performance; Word-of-mouth intentions"

However, the analytical methods have so far been quite limited, difficult, expensive, or cumbersome. Google Analytics (GA) offers a free tool for measuring and analysing visitor statistics. GA was tested on three food composition websites (Denmark, Finland, and Switzerland). All the websites had a considerable number of visitors, which seemed to increase with the maturity of the website. The results also suggested that there were a considerable number of potential unreached users in Denmark and particularly in Switzerland, thus suggesting that promotion be increased and search engines be taken into account more during website design. About 15-20% of users visited the website more than nine times and about 20% spent there more than 10 min on the site. Following traffic from referring websites showed that most of the visitors could not be categorised as food or nutrition professionals. Our experience showed that GA was quite easy to use and gave useful and versatile information that can be used to compare different websites and improve the website design.

This often stems from the foreign firms' limited understanding of a focal country's local culture and idiosyncrasies. Foreign firms are usually viewed as out-group entities, which lowers consumers' trust in them. The extent of such a phenomenon varies. In locations where people are more skeptical of out-groups, a critical question is whether it is possible to transform such foreign out-group firms into in-groups, specifically with the support of popular social networking media. Based on Social Identity Theory and Trust Transference Process, five strategies leveraging social grouping and social ties to build trust for foreign electronic commerce firms were proposed. A survey was conducted to examine their effectiveness. The results suggest that social-grouping strategies are useful for in-grouping foreign out-group entities to build trust, and the effectiveness of strategies is determined by the social similarity and psychological distance between the consumer and the endorser. This has important implications for scholars and practitioners, both local and abroad, to leverage social grouping to boost Internet sales. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Internet shopping; Social grouping; Social identity; Trust"

This study develops an integrated model to understand key factors of employee knowledge sharing intentions through constructs prescribed by two established knowledge management research streams, namely, those concerning individual motivations and social capital. This study classifies employee knowledge sharing intentions as either tacit or explicit and investigates whether the level of the determinants and their influences differ between the two. The research model is tested with survey data collected from 2010 employees in multiple industries. Analysis results show that the proposed model significantly explains the variance of employees’ tacit and explicit knowledge sharing intentions. This finding indicates that the model's unified perspective enhances our knowledge of how to improve employee knowledge sharing. The new findings reveal that organizational rewards have a negative effect on employees’ tacit knowledge sharing intentions but a positive influence on their explicit knowledge sharing intentions. The analysis results confirm that reciprocity, enjoyment, and social capital contribute significantly to enhancing employees’ tacit and explicit knowledge sharing intentions.

The main concern of this study is stages of adoption, which covers three phases in respect of the maturity of the RFID project and the sophistication of business applications and RFID technology. The level of analysis involves different units of analysis beyond the organization level, including the industry- and country-level, which is lacking in the current literature. To understand dimensions of RFID issues, a strategy, technology, organization, people and environment (STOPE) based approach was applied. An extensive review of prior literature was conducted to find various RFID success factors and the Delphi method was applied to find positions of these factors within the framework. Based on the Delphi, some factors belong to early stage of adoption, and some others persist in the later stages of adoption. At the country level, factors such as RFID national policy, R&D policy and income per capita were accepted by most experts at the preliminary and intermediate stage; strategy and environment were accepted as important domains. To find practical implications of the framework, a case study of Indonesia was conducted at each level of analysis. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was applied to identify most important factors and important domains of issues with respect to the factors from the Delphi results.

While the literature mainly addresses the forms and contingencies of IT governance structures for decision making, we focus on IT governance mechanisms for decision execution, that is, the role of top management, business managers and IT managers in post-adoption stages of technology diffusion and how these groups are held accountable for their role. We conceptualize decision execution mechanisms of IT governance as including two dimensions: vertical advocacy from top management and horizontal coordination between business and IT managers. Decision execution mechanisms are assumed to facilitate CRM use and value creation. We analyze a dataset of 82 Chinese firms to examine the model and associated hypotheses. Our results show that: (1) decision execution mechanisms, including both vertical advocacy and horizontal coordination, significantly contribute to the three stages of CRM diffusion; (2) vertical advocacy has a notably greater effect on CRM use and firm performance gains than horizontal coordination, which has a greater effect on process gains. (3) CRM use creates operational and strategic benefits in customer-oriented business processes, which further improves firm performance.

A concurrent assessment of the opposing perspectives and the contingencies under which each is relevant for supply channel performance can add valuable insights about the dynamics of knowledge exchange. We juxtapose the two behavior patterns using social capital theory and transaction cost economics (TCE) respectively as the explicators and employ knowledge complementarity as the contingency to reconcile the opposing behavior patterns. The choice of knowledge complementarity in this role stems from ample theoretical and empirical support in prior literature about the criticality of this factor in inter-firm knowledge exchange. We propose a research model, and use data from a field study of 82 firms in the Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) industry to test our model. Our findings indicate that overall inter-organizational trust (a surrogate for social capital) and knowledge complementarity promote knowledge exchange behavior in a supply channel. The retarding effect of risk of opportunism (a TCE dimension) manifests only when knowledge complementarity is low. However, when knowledge complementarity is high, contrary to expectations, inter-organizational trust appears to impede knowledge exchange. Our post hoc analysis of this intriguing, counterintuitive result leads us to knowledge interdependence and dependence asymmetry as potentially critical antecedents to knowledge complementarity.

Our findings suggest that utilitarian and hedonic attributes of products affect mobile brand equity through customer experience. In other words, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, entertainment, and aesthetics may not be intrinsic value; their value on mobile brand equity is realized through customer experience. However, whereas the effect of perceived ease of use on mobile brand equity is partially mediated, perceived usefulness, entertainment, and aesthetics are fully mediated by customer experience. By showing the differential effects of product attributes on mobile brand equity, this study provides a more refined understanding of the interplay among product attributes, customer experience, and mobile brand equity.

Few if any studies have investigated the factors that might contribute to the establishment of trusting relationship between city councils and citizens. This paper examines the relative importance and significance of three types of information communication technologies (ICTs) towards the use of e-government and the development of civic engagement. We conduct an empirical investigation of 179 Spanish official town websites (web sites in the municipalities). The research findings suggest that implementing ICT not only involves a step towards an increase in the use of e-government services by people, but also provides numerous opportunities for their civic engagement. The main conclusion of this study is that although ICT can leverage the adoption of e-government, it cannot create alone engagement with traditional activities of the local government. What is missing from this relationship is a mediating variable (adoption of e-government by government officers), which in turn can greatly help to better understand how ICT impacts relationships between governments and their citizens. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is little empirical research on factors influencing the adoption of data mining tools (DMTs), particularly at an individual level. This study investigates how users perceive and adopt DMTs to broaden practical knowledge for the business intelligence community. First, this study develops a theoretical model based on the Technology Acceptance Model 3, and then examines its perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and its ability to explain users' intentions to use DMTs. The model's determinants include 4 categories: the task-oriented dimension (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, response time, and format), control beliefs (computer self-efficacy and perceptions of external control), emotion (computer anxiety), and intrinsic motivation (computer playfulness). This study also surveys the moderating effect of experience and output quality on the determinants of DMT adoption and use. An empirical study involving 206 DMT users was conducted to evaluate the model using structural equation modeling. Results demonstrate that the proposed model explains 58% of the variance. The findings of this study have interesting implications with respect to DMT adoption, both for researchers and practitioners. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

XML has been identified by many as a prominent technology for enabling electronic supply chain integration, but the adoption of it in the industry has been rather slow and limited. This paper discusses the factors that enable agility in supply chains, and explains why XML is the best candidate for facilitating such factors. Then the major XML-based integration initiatives such as ebXML, RosettaNet, and Web Services are diagnosed in terms of their pros and cons for supply chain agility, as well as the reasons for their slow diffusion. Based on the discussion, this paper proposes that: the integration efforts need to first focus on the industries that need agility; stringent business process standards are necessary; and implementation should be made much easier and more affordable for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

As the e-commerce volume is increasing and various online services are becoming more popular, the number of sites to which an average Internet user subscribes is increasing rapidly. Given the limited memory capacity of human beings, an Internet user's login credentials (in the form of a combination of a user ID and a password) are usually reused over multiple accounts, which can cause significant security problems. In this study, we address the vulnerability of login credentials. First, based on a unique Internet user data set, we analyze the behavioral characteristics of login credentials usage. We find that the same login credentials are used for many more accounts and reused much more often than previously expected. Furthermore, usage patterns are found to be quite skewed.

This, combined with the emerging mobile savvy younger generation poses an interesting challenge for the future of the banking sector in Oman and implies a need for the sector to rethink the strategic use of, and approach to, implementation of on-line banking in a way that is complementary to the cultural and ethological dimension of the market. In effect, the banking sector will need to manage the covert tension between technology driving ""fast time"", and the Omani culture, religion and tradition demanding face to face ""slow time"". © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Why do commercial companies contribute to open source software?","2012","International Journal of Information Management","10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2011.10.003","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857785050&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijinfomgt.2011.10.003&partnerID=40&md5=38c8951d7c5ad5930dd992d2a975cbad","Many researchers have pointed out that the open source movement is an interesting phenomenon that is difficult to explain with conventional economic theories. However, while there is no shortage on research on individuals' motivation for contributing to open source, few have investigated the commercial companies' motivations for doing the same. A case study was conducted at three different companies from the IT service industry, to investigate three possible drivers: sale of complimentary services, innovation and opensourcing (outsourcing). We offer three conclusions. First, we identified three main drivers for contributing to open source, which are (a) selling complimentary services, (b) building greater innovative capability and (c) cost reduction through opensourcing to an external community. Second, while previous research has documented that the most important driver is selling complimentary services, we found that this picture is too simple. Our evidence points to a broader set of motivations, in the sense that all our cases exhibit combinations of the three drivers. Finally, our findings suggest that there might be a shift in how commercial companies view open source software. The companies interviewed have all expressed a moral obligation to contribute to open source. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Commercial; Drivers; Open source software"
"Scale for classifying organizations as explorers, exploiters or ambidextrous","2012","International Journal of Information Management","10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2011.07.001","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84855896579&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijinfomgt.2011.07.001&partnerID=40&md5=d8e93d1908302816f3ea6920919fd1fb","This paper presents a scale developed to classify organizations through cluster analysis as being exploiters, explores, ambidextrous or with no defined orientation. The theoretical framework helps identify that the concepts associated with exploration and exploitation may be classified into six practical dimensions: organizational knowledge practices, innovative practices, competition, strategic orientation, organizational efficiency and partnerships. After stripping the data, the scale was underpinned by 45 attributes related to these dimensions. Convergent and divergent validity statistics are presented resulting from a questionnaire being applied to 249 respondents from companies located in Brazil. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Emergent digital services are interactive and multidimensional, associated systems multi-tiered and distributed. A holistic perspective is essential to their effective analysis and design, for beyond technical considerations, there are complex social, economic, organisational, and ergonomic requirements and relationships to consider. Such a perspective cannot be gained without direct user involvement, yet evidence suggests that development teams may be failing to effectively engage with users, relying on requirements derived from anecdotal evidence or prior experience. In such instances, there is a risk that services might be well designed, but functionally useless. This paper highlights the role of process modelling in gaining such perspective. Process modelling challenges, approaches, and success factors are considered, discussed with reference to a recent evaluation of usability and usefulness of a UK National Health Service (NHS) digital library. Reflecting on lessons learnt, recommendations are made regarding appropriate process modelling approach and application. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Digital library; Digital service; Process modelling; System usefulness"

Some firms proactively manage the knowledge gained from such partnership while others do so to a lesser extent. Through a questionnaire survey of business clients in Singapore, this study helps to shed some light on the nature of client-vendor partnership, factors affecting knowledge transfer (defined in terms of knowledge codifiability, client's motivation for partnership, vendor's willingness to share, and trust between client and vendor). In addition, we also examine mechanisms for knowledge dissemination within the client organization and the impact on the IT function. The results should be of interest to both researchers and practitioners in better understanding how such partnership could be managed more effectively. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

While e-government has now matured in most developed European countries, transition economies in Europe, have only recently begun to recognise its potential benefits and incorporated e-government as part of their national strategy. Although time may result in the amplification of e-government experience for transition economy countries, lessons drawn from developed countries indicate that political, fiscal, social, strategic and organisational issues need to be addressed when formulating plans for deploying e-government. Using case study research, this paper examines strategies adopted by the UK and Slovakia in the context of e-government implementation. Particularly, the paper examines how the perspectives on e-government vision, strategy, focus and related organisational change influence the implementation and diffusion of e-government in developed and transition economies in Europe. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Computer-aided design (CAD) is becoming firms' competitive weapon beyond its traditional function as a product design tool. Yet, it is unclear how the full potential of IT system, particularly the usage patterns of 3D CAD system, may be realized through organizational capabilities. This paper presents a model of IT system configurations and CAD usage patterns. Next, a typology of IT system configurations is presented based on (1) the degree of CAD integration between assembly makers and suppliers and (2) the structure of product design information (i.e.; product architecture). The product architecture of four electronic firms illustrates that information integration through organizational capabilities is more important than IT investment itself. The findings suggest that a Korean firm accomplishes a greater level of IT integration compared to the other two Japanese firms and thus attain better market performance. This study offers valuable insight on effective IT integration strategy for competitive advantage in the global market. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This capability is used particularly in solving NP-complete problems or implementing cryptography and steganography solutions. Biological computation models based on bonds between nitrogen bases in nucleic acid chains that make up DNA structures can also be used to develop new solutions for smart information management. This study discusses new secret splitting techniques based on mathematical linguistic methods and designed for intelligently managing secret data within hierarchical structures. These techniques make use of information coding models found in the coding of DNA sequences. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Global search engines may not adequately address local users' needs while regional web portals may lack rich web content. Different from search engines, web directories organize sites and pages into intuitive hierarchical structures to facilitate browsing. However, high-quality web directories in users' native languages often do not exist and their development requires much domain knowledge not readily available. In this research, we proposed a novel semi-automatic approach to facilitate web repository management. We applied the approach to developing web directories in the business and health-care domains for the Spanish-speaking and Arabic-speaking communities respectively. The two directories contain respectively 4735 and 5107 unique sites and pages with a maximum depth of 5 levels. Results of experiments involving 37 native speakers show that these directories outperformed existing benchmark directories in terms of browsing effectiveness and efficiency, providing strong implications for information professionals and multinational enterprise managers. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Business intelligence; Emerging economies; Knowledge management; Medical intelligence; Web browsing; Web directory development"
