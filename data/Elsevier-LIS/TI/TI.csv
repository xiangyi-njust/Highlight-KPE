"Exploring the relations of subjective and objective Instagram use on young adults' mental health","2023","Telematics and Informatics","10.1016/j.tele.2022.101921","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144343708&doi=10.1016%2fj.tele.2022.101921&partnerID=40&md5=f620fd26aa928f36de66115efab58e02","We collected objective digital trace Instagram use data and subjective self-report use data to investigate relations with self-reported self-esteem, loneliness, body satisfaction, and depression among 192 young adults (ages 18–25). To our knowledge, this work is among the first of its kind to include both self-report data and digital trace data to understand similarities and differences in how each relates to aspects of users’ mental health. We measured and coded for both active and passive social media use. For objective passive Instagram use, results showed a negative relationship with loneliness and depression, and a positive relationship with body satisfaction and self-esteem. Subjective passive use, however, was related positively to depression. Subjective active use was also positively related to depression. We discuss the implications of these findings, given the observed differences in the relationships as a function of the type of Instagram use measurement. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Instagram; Mental health; Objective measurement; Subjective measurement; Young adults"

To do so, this study collected data from Qualtrics panels to recruit appropriate user samples who have YouTube accounts and are currently subscribing to their favorite influencers’ YouTube channels in the United States. Via structural equation modeling, this study found that influencer playfulness had a significant influence on satisfaction and perceived quality of alternatives while content expertise of influencer had significant effects on satisfaction, perceived quality of alternatives, investment size, and social media engagement. Also, the empirical findings indicated that commitment to influencer was significantly affected by satisfaction, perceived quality of alternatives, and investment size, which consequently resulted in social media engagement and purchase intention. Theoretical insights and practical implications for social media influencer marketing strategies were discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Content expertise of influencer; Influencer playfulness; Investment model; Purchase intention; Social media engagement; Social media influencer"
"Social support for digital inclusion of women in South African townships","2022","Telematics and Informatics","10.1016/j.tele.2022.101893","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140483366&doi=10.1016%2fj.tele.2022.101893&partnerID=40&md5=095081cf0fcea8b2bd6c5e519b523bf9","Despite strong evidence of its critical role in facilitating digital inclusion, social support – the emotional, instrumental and informational aid received from support networks to assist an individual's use of digital technologies – remains an unexplored area of research in low-resourced South African communities. By drawing on the ‘Typology of digital social support’ framework, this paper presents rich insights into the intricacies of the underlying motivations, behaviour and help-seeking processes in the digital engagement of women in South African townships. The findings show that the women had the strong social embeddedness necessary for digital support and relied on a range of nuanced and cross-cutting support-seeking strategies, including formal and particularly informal support channels and, to a lesser extent, self-learning. This qualitative phenomenological study relies on in-depth individual interviews with a small sample of women in three South African townships. In revealing potential disparities between social support in developed and developing regions, the study affirms the need to prioritise further South African research and the development of theoretical frameworks grounded in local realities. © 2022 The Authors","Digital inclusion; ICT; Social support; South African townships; Women"

To enhance the reach of health communication on social media, scholars have proposed that emoji be used to convey scientific information. The current study explored the influence of emoji on the effectiveness of health communication on social media. Automated content analysis revealed that the presence of emoji in online health information resulted in higher levels of social media engagement (SME) than the absence of emoji did. Additionally, a 2 (emoji: present versus absent) × 3 (visual complexity of information design: low versus medium versus high) online experiments revealed that the presence of emoji in health information sequentially increased perceived enjoyment and perceived interactivity, thereby promoting SME. However, this effect is influenced by the visual complexity of health information designs. The presence of emoji is only effective in increasing SME with health information presented using a design with low or medium visual complexity. This study provides theoretical and practical insights into visual health communication and health information design. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Emoji; Health communication; Perceived enjoyment; Perceived interactivity; Social media engagement; Visual complexity"

However, research has yet to examine if and how these variables associate with emoji use frequency when considered together. In a correlational study (N = 444), we explored the relative contribution of individual characteristics, perceived relatedness to others, and motives to explain the frequency of emoji use with different interlocutors. Hierarchical linear regressions showed that being younger, scoring higher on conscientiousness, and resorting to emoji for personal contact were correlates of emoji use frequency with closer interlocutors (e.g., family and friends). In contrast, being older, scoring lower on agreeableness, and perceiving more relational intimacy were correlates of emoji use frequency with more distant interlocutors (e.g., supervisors and doctors). Overall, results highlight the need to account for multiple variables at different levels to examine emoji use patterns in digital communication. © 2023 The Author(s)","Computer-mediated communication; Context; Emoji; Individual differences; Online communication; Text-based communication"

Our study adds to this debate by exploring the effect of chatbot agents’ emotional disclosure on people's willingness to donate to a charitable cause, and by examining individual and serial mediation between the main effects of perceived anthropomorphism and social presence. To this end, two types of artificial intelligence chatbot agents—one disclosing factual information and another disclosing human-like emotion—were developed and trained using Dialogflow, a natural language processing engine. A total of 619 US residents were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing platform. Of these, 593 participants completed the required conversation with either version of the chatbot agent (factual vs. emotional), as well as the survey questionnaire, and therefore, were included in the final analysis. The participants exhibited a higher willingness to donate when they interacted with a chatbot disclosing human-like emotions than when they were only exposed to factual information. Moreover, this study found both individual and serial mediating roles of perceived anthropomorphism and social presence. Concerning the implications, theoretically, this study adds to the understanding of applying the notion of human interaction to that involving humans and chatbots. Practically, our findings can be of great help in increasing willingness to donate thereby enhancing fund-raising activities. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropomorphism; Chatbot-human interaction; Emotional disclosure; Social presence; Willingness to donate"
"Should I scan my face?

Drawing on the perspectives of perceived value and trust, we developed a research model to explore how the Chinese users’ trade-off between perceived benefits (perceived convenience and perceived novelty) and perceived risks (perceived privacy risk and perceived financial risk) influences their usage intention. Based on survey data from 1,200 Chinese mobile payment users, this study uses structural equation modeling to examine the hypotheses. Our results show that perceived convenience positively influences perceived value, while privacy risk and financial risk negatively influence perceived value and trust. Although perceived novelty has no significant effect on perceived value and trust, perceived value positively influences trust, and both of them have a positive effect on the intention to use. Furthermore, our moderation analysis indicates that the influence of perceived value on the intention to use is stronger among users who consider facial information to be more sensitive. The theoretical implications for research as well as the practical implications for practitioners are also discussed. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Facial recognition payment; Intention to use; Perceived value; Trust"

We examine whether publishers can know users’ satisfaction with books in advance, and both metadata and book covers help predict this satisfaction. Exploring effects of metadata and book covers on the satisfaction is not only necessary for publishers’ perspectives, but also for librarians’ perceptions. However, the majority of prior research on user preference-based book recommendation systems in both book industry and library system employed review comments, ratings, or book loan records. Thus, we open up the potentiality of other factors, which implicitly affect the satisfaction with books. We collected book titles, authors, publishers, reviews, ratings, and covers from the “Literature and Fiction” genre in the Amazon bookstore and conducted an experiment to predict readers’ satisfaction ratings based on book reviews, metadata, and book covers. Several deep learning classifiers (CNN, ResNet, LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, BiGRU) were employed. Reviews alone can reach a certain level of prediction performance, but adding metadata, cover images, and cover objects to a review-based predictive model slightly improves that performance. Based on these results, we confirmed that both metadata and book covers improve predicting readers’ perceived satisfaction. This study is a pilot exploration of the idea that multimodal approaches can improve the prediction of the perceived satisfaction of book readers.

With the protection motivation theory (PMT), this study divided fact-checking into verification and correction and analyzed the influence of threat and coping appraisal on health misinformation verification and correction intentions. Furthermore, the moderating effect of empathy was analyzed based on the prosocial characteristics of fact-checking. A total of 341 participants completed an online survey. The results of regression analysis showed that higher perceived reward and coping efficiency were associated with higher verification intention. Empathy positively moderated the effect of perceived threat on verification. The perceived threat, reward, and coping efficiency increased users’ intention to correct health misinformation. Moreover, findings also demonstrated that users would combine threat and coping appraisal to decide their fact-checking intention. The study extends PMT theory by incorporating users’ ability to empathize with others’ risk situations and uncovers a cognitive risk game process for health misinformation verification and correction on social media. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Fact-checking; Health misinformation; Protection motivation theory; Verification and correction intention"

This is driving the need for faster adoption and implementation of 5G technologies. Researchers have largely focused on the technical aspects of 5G and its adoption on the demand side, while the focus on the supply side—business implications, enablers and barriers to adoption for the telecom service providers (TSPs)—is limited. A supply side perspective on 5G adoption in developing economies needs more attention as their ecosystem of technology deployment is different from that of developed economies. India being one of the prominent developing countries and the second largest telecom market in the world, with 5G adoption at a nascent stage, is an apt case for studying enablers and barriers. Thus, this exploratory study focuses on identifying the factors for adoption of 5G by TSPs. The study makes theoretical contributions to literature by identifying seven unique factors and eight unique subfactors and proposing a new 5G adoption model for TSPs. Recommendations are provided to aid policy and decision-makers in designing policy interventions and strategies for faster 5G adoption from the supply side of the diverse ecosystem. © 2023","5G; Adoption; India; Management of technology; Telecom service provider"

A lab experiment (N = 128) with a between-subjects factorial design was conducted to examine how social robots’ behavioral outcomes and social roles affected individuals’ modeling behavior. This study suggested that social robots’ positive behavioral outcomes were effective in evoking users’ modeling tendencies serially through social presence and identification or only through identification. Robots’ mere presentation of behavior with no outcomes exerted effects serially through social presence and identification. Additionally, assigning social robots an instructor role led to users’ modeling behavior serially through users’ perception of robots’ expertise and credibility.

The aim of the current study was to explore how these two online environmental factors impact people to move their opinions toward an extreme position (polarize). In addition to environmental factors, we investigated how an individual trait (i.e., need for approval) influenced people to take pre-existing opinions to an extreme position (polarize). We conducted an online experiment (2 [anonymity vs non-anonymity] by 2 [like-minded others vs different-minded others]) using Amazon Mechanical Turk workers (n = 476). Findings showed that being with like-minded others led individuals to move their opinions toward extremity.

Although research at the latent-construct level has linked nomophobia with smartphone use or fear of missing out (FoMO), little is understood about their interrelations at the item level. This study used a novel network analysis to explore the nature of nomophobia and its connections with the contents of smartphone use and FoMO at the item level. We constructed three network models: one to identify the central nodes of nomophobia, and two co-occurrence networks to investigate the bridge nodes between nomophobia and smartphone use or FoMO. A total of 2376 Chinese college students (M age = 19.52; 73.7% female) completed a survey assessing the contents of smartphone use, FoMO, and nomophobia. The results indicated that worrying about not being reachable and feeling awkward about not checking notifications were central nodes in the nomophobia network. The desire to check smartphones (under nomophobia) and entertainment-related use (under smartphone use) as well as worrying about not staying up to date (under nomophobia) and worrying about “friends having fun without me” (under FoMO) were significant bridge nodes in the co-occurrence networks. These findings indicate that entertainment-related smartphone use and worrying about missing out on fun with friends were related to vulnerability to nomophobia. Therefore, interventions focusing on these factors may provide promising countermeasures. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Contents of smartphone use; Fear of missing out; Network analysis; Nomophobia"

A short-length advertisement platform has been launched to address this problem, but reducing the advertisement length would reduce the effectiveness of the advertising. As such, this study quantitatively analyzes the acceptable length of an advertisement, the attributes affecting consumer acceptance, and the extent to which they affect consumer acceptance. We use a mixed logit model with data collected from a choice experiment, and analyze consumers’ willingness to receive monetary rewards to watch mobile advertisements using the concept of willingness to accept (WTA). The results show that consumers’ marginal WTA for watching a single advertisement is KRW 2.389 (USD 0.00212) and WTA for one second of advertisement is KRW 0.484 (USD 0.00043). Therefore, we can derive that the appropriate length of one mobile advertisement, from the consumer's perspective, is 4.94 s. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of advertisement length on consumers’ utility using individual characteristics. Based on the results, advertising companies can provide customized advertisement lengths to meet consumer characteristics, reducing consumer avoidance behavior and improving the efficiency of advertisements. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Advertisement length; Bumper ads; Choice experiments; Mixed logit model; Mobile advertisements; YouTube"

There is, however, a need for differentiating non-harmful and problematic binge-watching. This is the first study using a machine learning analytical strategy to further investigate the distinct psychological predictors of these two binge-watching patterns. A total of 4275 TV series viewers completed an online survey assessing sociodemographic variables, binge-watching engagement, and relevant predictor variables (i.e., viewing motivations, impulsivity facets, and affect). In one set of analyses, we modeled intensity of non-harmful involvement in binge-watching as the dependent variable, while in a following set of analyses, we modeled intensity of problematic involvement in binge-watching as the dependent variable. Emotional enhancement motivation, followed by enrichment and social motivations, were the most important variables in modeling non-harmful involvement. Coping/escapism motivation, followed by urgency and lack of perseverance (two impulsivity traits), were found as the most important predictors of problematic involvement. These findings indicate that non-harmful involvement is characterized by positive reinforcement triggered by TV series watching, while problematic involvement is linked to negative reinforcement motives and impulsivity traits. © 2022 The Author(s)","Affect; Binge-watching; Engagement; Impulsivity; Machine learning; Motives; TV series"

When sexts are received or forwarded without the consent of the original sender, this is called non-consensual sexting. Our study set out to increase our understanding as to why individuals engage in non-consensual sext forwarding, by examining the role of sexting intentions, attitudes, and experience with non-consensual sext receiving. Data were collected through a cross-sectional survey among a sample of 218 Belgian adults. Of this total sample, 169 (Mage = 25.85 years, 73.4% women) respondents had at least once received a sext from someone, resulting in a subsample of 169 respondents for the present study. Correlation analyses showed that non-consensual forwarding of sexts was significantly positively linked to stronger attitudes towards the risks of sexting and to experiences of non-consensual sext receiving. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that non-consensual sext forwarding was significantly linked to negative attitudes about sexting, but that this significant link disappeared when non-consensual sext receiving was included as a predictor in the model. Thus, our findings show that non-consensual sext forwarding is primarily linked to non-consensual sext receiving, suggesting that individuals who experience non-consensual sexting as a recipient are inclined to non-consensually forward a sext themselves regardless of their attitudes about (the risks of) sexting. This suggests that non-consensual sexting behaviours may be driven by social learning and/or impulsive decision-making processes, indicating an important avenue for future research. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Aggravated sexting; Dual-process decision making; Non-consensual sexting; Sexting attitudes; Sexting intention; Social learning"

This shared attention in media-multitasking situations poses a challenge to media planers when attracting the audience's attention. However, attention-grabbing tactics might backfire on companies as they make manipulative intent salient and, therefore, decrease levels of brand attitude. This study advances the extant research by challenging the suitability of silence as an attention-grabbing practice in advertising during media multitasking. More specifically, we test if atypical (i.e. silent) slogans in TV commercials impact on consumers’ evaluation of brand-related information when media multitasking. Utilizing a one-factor (two-level) between-subject laboratory experiment (N = 66), this study examined participants’ feelings of manipulation and brand attitude when exposed to typical versus atypical TV advertising slogans in a media-multitasking situation. The results demonstrate that a typical TV advertising slogan (i.e. audio in addition to vision) during media multitasking results in lower salience of manipulative intent compared to an atypical slogan (i.e. silent) and positively impacts on brand attitude. © 2023 The Author(s)","Advertising slogans; Brand attitude; Manipulative intent; Media multitasking; Persuasion knowledge model"

Drawing upon the risk information seeking and processing model and the hybrid model of cyberchondria, this study investigated how health anxiety, information insufficiency, OHIS contributed to cyberchondria over time. We conducted a three-wave panel survey in China (N = 1,271, W1 in June 2021; N = 816, W2 in July 2021; N = 654, W3 in August 2021). Results of a cross-lagged panel model demonstrated that health anxiety at Wave 1 had a cross-lagged effect on information insufficiency at Wave 2. Moreover, information insufficiency at Wave 1 increased OHIS at Wave 2, which further predicted cyberchondria at Wave 3. Health anxiety, information insufficiency, and OHIS were directly and positively related to cyberchondria across the waves, except that information insufficiency at Wave 1 did not predict cyberchondria at Wave 2. This study documented the dynamic and intricate processes underlying the development of cyberchondria, providing both theoretical and practical insights in this nascent research area. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Cross-lagged panel model; Cyberchondria; Health anxiety; Information insufficiency; Online health information seeking"

Information to influence customer decision-making in online purchasing environments is becoming increasingly focused, but the diverse mechanisms of information ecosystems for building trust are little recognized. Therefore, the current study fills a research gap in consumer behavior by explaining the effect of determinants on purchasing and recommendation behavior from the perspective of information ecosystem elements. This study proposed a theoretical model combining the stimulus-organization-response (S-O-R) model, the effect hierarchy model, and the information ecosystem theory. The 372 valid responses were collected through a structured questionnaire and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). Theoretical and empirical evidence support the mediation role of cognitive and affective trust in explaining online physician ratings and consumer behavior. The results revealed that the novel technology and functions should be introduced into the online physician review platform to enhance information quality and perceived similarity between receivers and senders. Practitioners should focus more on developing cognitive and affective trust, which will benefit the rapid growth of online shopping.

This study aims to fill this research gap by investigating the effect of mobile broadband network coverage on income inequality in underdeveloped regions of Indonesia using unbalanced panel data encompassing 122 second-level subnational regions over the period from 2018 to 2021. This study utilizes map charts to visually depict the disparities in mobile broadband coverage and income inequality across the selected regions and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression on the pooled panel data to estimate the relationship between the two variables. The findings reveal an inverted U-shaped relationship between mobile broadband coverage and income inequality, indicating an adverse effect on inequality during the early stages of network deployment that persists until coverage reaches approximately 60 percent of the population area. Beyond this threshold, the effect becomes favorable in reducing inequality. The findings of this study remain robust even after accounting for potential biases, utilizing fixed and random effect models, and disaggregating the data for the pre- and during-pandemic periods. However, a minor discrepancy in statistical significance is observed when the dataset is disaggregated by the level of regional development.

The present study aims to fill these research gaps using data from a two-wave panel survey among emerging adults between 16 and 21 years. Analyses show that ghosting romantic partners and ghosting friends are different phenomena: While communication overload (i.e., the feeling of receiving more messages than one can handle) positively predicts ghosting romantic partners, ghosting friends is predicted by one's self-esteem. Most notably, ghosting others within romantic relationships did not yield any effects on well-being, whereas ghosting friends increased depressive tendencies over time, demonstrating that ghosting is not only harmful to those who are ghosted, but can also negatively impact those who ghost others. © 2023 The Author(s)","Communication overload; Depressive tendencies; Friendships; Ghosting; Romantic relationships; Self-esteem"

Discussants were aware of the consequences of expressing viewpoints on politically sensitive topics. They adopted several strategies to conceal their views, such as self-censoring, lurking, diverting to other topics, and pretending to agree. Discussants also used sophisticated privacy management tactics on social media to manipulate the visibility of their communicative behaviors in different settings.

During infodemics, the challenges and difficulties are to reveal the dynamic evolution of public's engagement to fake news rebuttals information and break through the bottleneck of previous static research. Motivated by this, fake news rebuttals engagement index (FNREI) is proposed to state the public engagement towards COVID-19 related fake news rebuttals. A total of 19,603 fake news rebuttals microblogs from Weibo are divided into four categories by latent dirichlet allocation (LDA): “status and confirmed cases of COVID-19″, ”transmission mode and living conditions of coronavirus“, ”prevention and detection of COVID-19″ and “overseas fake news and derivative events”. Time-varying parameter vector auto-regressive model (TVP-VAR) is used to explore the time-varying impact of the COVID-19 life cycle and the appearance of virus mutation (Delta, Omicron) on four categories of FNREI time series. The research results suggest that under the impact of different major events during the COVID-19 life cycle, the public's engagement to different categories of COVID-19 related fake news has different priorities, its duration and intensity is dynamically changing.

Findings indicate that exposure to popular but widely-denounced COVID-19 misinformation via social media had positive effects on verification intention. Frequent exposure to misinformation on social media is associated with lower misperceptions, suggesting a healthy dose of skepticism toward the platform and low internalization of misinformation. Special attention, however, needs to be paid to online news websites and personal contacts as misinformation sources. More tailored interventions and communication strategies to reduce misperceptions and increase media-literate behaviors are needed for younger, conservative, and ethnic minority individuals.

Overall, a sense of presence was a significant mediator for 1) the relationship between vividness and sensory brand app experience and 2) the relationship between interactivity and attitude towards technology for VR but no such relationship was observed with AR. The relationships among sensory brand app experience, attitude, and behavioral intention were significant in both AR and VR settings.

In an effort to address these lacunae in research, this study explores how IVR affordances for collaboration influence task performance and collaboration satisfaction. Drawing on the metaverse framework for collaboration against the backdrop of the corporeal embodiment concept, this study develops a research model that investigates the interplay between IVR affordances for collaboration, collaborative behavior enactment, and collaboration outcomes. The model was tested using data collected from 168 subjects who participated in a virtual collaboration using IVR in a laboratory setting. The results of the study showed that avatar customizability was a key antecedent to embodied affordances, among which embodied communication and embodied team processing jointly influenced collaborative behavior enactment, which, in turn, influenced collaboration outcomes (task performance and collaboration satisfaction). This study contributes to the IVR literature by conceptualizing novel affordances for collaboration facilitated by IVR and empirically scrutinizing the manner in which perceived affordances precipitate their actualization, subsequently affecting collaboration outcomes.

This study investigates how individuals’ use of information via social media helps them achieve psychological and behavioral advances in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study's novelty lies in its positioning of social media information seeking (SMIS) as a precursor to the staged behavioral processes of the Theory of Planned Behavior. This novel extension entails the testing of a conceptual model of the influence of SMIS on three psychological factors (i.e., attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control), which, in turn, predict behavioral intention. It implements cross-sectional data from a survey of adults in New York City in 2020 (N = 1,021). The structural equation models were well-fitting and generally validated by the data, including the posited two steps from SMIS to psychological factors to behavioral intention. Structural equation modeling underscores the role of SMIS as a core driver of wearing a facemask, with positive effects on attitudes and perceived behavioral control and subsequent mediated positive effects on behavioral intention.

In a 2 (framing: gain vs loss) × 2 (SMVM: high vs low) between-subjects experiment (N = 404), participants were exposed to Facebook posts about mitigating climate change. Major findings indicate: (1) gain framing, compared to loss, resulted in increased social desirability perception of pro-environmental messages when they are accompanied by high numbers of likes and shares; (2) social desirability perception mediated the effect of message framing on third person perception (TPP) but not on second person perception (SPP); (3) numbers of likes and shares affected participants’ message influence perceptions (TPP and SPP), and this was mediated by social desirability perception; and (4) message influence perceptions were found to be significant predictors of participants’ intentions for climate change mitigation actions. Study results implicate that SMVM can signal media content popularity and this can further affect social desirability and influence perceptions of the content. Message framing appeared to have an effect on how one thinks media content influence other people, especially in the presence of high levels of endorsement by others.

As countries around the world are committing to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, reducing carbon footprint has become an eminent priority for policymakers, businesses, and the public. Clean and green energy in the form of electricity has emerged as an alternative to fossil fuel. Since electricity is scarce and in high demand it has become an important problem for identifying robust energy consumption predictive models for powered smart residential homes. In our research we compare SVR, LSTM, GRU, CNN-LSTM, CNN-GRU models for predictive energy consumption data of smart residential homes. Empirical results indicate that with increase in the amount of data the performance of machine learning SVR degraded significantly more as compared to Deep Learning Techniques, which provides conclusive evidence that machine learning techniques are not suitable for the task. Whereas, our proposed CNN-GRU architecture performs 17.4% better in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) with a value of 0.151 compared to the LSTM which has a value of MAE equals to 0.183 for days granularity of data and is only bested by the LSTM by 0.4% in terms of MAE for hour granularity data, where the CNN-GRU has MAE of 0.229 and LSTM achieves the MAE of 0.228.

However, to develop research capable of addressing the complexity and multilayered nature of IPCs on SNSs, valid and reliable IPC survey scales are necessary. To this end, a systematic review of IPC scales utilized in SNS research was conducted to describe the survey inventories used, identify critical issues, and suggest directions for future research. Articles measuring SNS users’ IPCs published before 2023 were reviewed systematically using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) methodology. Altogether, 4,581 screened abstracts yielded 120 eligible articles, in which 53 different survey scales for the measurement of SNS users’ IPCs were used. These scales predominantly measure IPCs arising from organizational practices (i.e., vertical IPCs) rather than SNS user practices (i.e., horizontal IPCs). The results also indicated that scarce attention has been paid to ensuring the scales’ validity, particularly structural validity, criterion validity, and measurement invariance. © 2023 The Author(s)","COSMIN methodology; Information privacy concerns; Measurement quality; Social network sites; Survey scale; Systematic review"

However, a lack of data, combined with few independent and scientifically reproducible assessments, make it challenging for governments to make strategic choices to achieve this target. Therefore, new research approaches are required to support decision evaluation. This paper demonstrates an innovative method which addresses data and model uncertainty by developing open-source software to explore affordable universal broadband strategies, using a scenario-based hypothetical mobile operator. Targets being considered by the United Nations’ Broadband Commission are evaluated, with the financial costs of different infrastructure decisions quantified for the whole of the African continent. The results suggest that ‘leapfrogging’ to 4G is more cost efficient than 3G for providing universal broadband, with savings between 7 and 57 % for 10 GB/Month and 20–47 % for 30 GB/Month. The baseline 4G cost for connecting all unconnected and underserved users across Africa is $0.4 trillion for 10 GB/Month and $0.7–1 trillion for 30 GB/Month. © 2022","4G; Broadband; Infrastructure; Policy; Universal service"

Using a variety of natural language processing methods, this paper measured textual complexity from the perspectives of word complexity, logical complexity, and abnormal negative emotion based on the textual data of the 1.15 million online messages left by the citizens to government leaders on China's online public service platform, and explored its impact on government responses. Based on the Double-hurdle model, this paper found that the government response can be composed of two decision-making processes: response-intention, which indicates whether to respond, and response-level, which represents the extent of response. For response-intention decision-making, the simpler the words and logic of the message, the more likely it is to receive a reply from the government. For response-level decision-making, messages with more complex words and logic received a higher level of government response. Abnormal negative emotion in the message significantly reduced the government's response intention and response level, and the negative effect of abnormal negative emotion on response intention was much greater than on the response level. This study not only helps to understand how the government makes decisions based on textual information, but also has important value for responsive government construction and equalization of government services. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Government communication; Government responsiveness; Natural language processing; Textual complexity; The online public service"

To test the effectiveness of rural broadband programmes in improving internet usage, this study is based on a selection of five geographically adjacent administrative districts with varying population densities. During a survey using the double-bounded dichotomous choice model to measure people's WTP, two research hypotheses were tested and verified through regression analysis. The results showed that consumers living in rural areas are significantly less willing to pay for broadband than those living in urban areas, which contradicts the findings of the study by Worden and Hambly (2022) conducted in Canada. Additionally, the significant t value test results found in this study showed that consumers are willing to pay more for download bandwidth than for upload bandwidth for every dollar spent. This result indicates that consumers have a clear preference for one over the other and highlights significant differences in their choices. In particular, the results of the willingness-to-pay survey revealed that the incumbent operator yield opposite results in the regression coefficients for their willingness to pay for each unit of download bandwidth and upload bandwidth. This result may be due to differences in the design of internet products offered by the two operators. Given the inevitable reality that income generated by service operators in rural areas is lower than that in urban areas, there is a need to study price differentials between urban and rural areas in order to promote greater use of broadband internet in rural areas in the context of the adoption of a single price throughout the region. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Broadband prices; Digital divide; Internet use; Rural development; Willingness to pay"

Most studies on social media addiction are based on the variable-centered approach with very few taking a person-centered approach. Since only one previous study has investigated the profiles of social media addiction based on a psychopathological model, it is important to bring a complementary view by exploring psychosocial traits associated with the different levels of maladaptive social media use, as well as antecedents of these profiles in terms of sociodemographic variables. To fill this gap, the present study explored social media addiction profiles based on a psychosocial model. The profile indicators were social media addiction, need to belong, anxious attachment, and social media intensity use (SMIU). Data were collected from 705 participants (61% females, age range 18–54 years, Mage = 30.2 years). Latent profile analysis (LPA) showed three distinct profiles: ‘low risk of addiction’ (61.3%), ‘moderate risk of addiction’ (29.6%), and ‘high risk of addiction’ (9.1%). Social anxiety, gender, and age were antecedents of the profiles. These results based on mixture modeling approach are meaningful to the field, bringing a complementary view to the previous findings obtained in a psychopathological framework.

By comparing different machine learning models, the study selects the XGBoost model with the highest accuracy to identify the type of social bots with specific automation features in the Chinese context. Meanwhile, based on the representative public health emergency, the study uses a large-scale social media dataset (N = 328539) to explore how social bots affect multi-dimensional public opinion dynamics in the information ecosystem.

Governments and non-governmental organizations have introduced policies and programs to conserve pollinators and increase public awareness of pollinator decline. This study focuses on online and social media content about pollinators as a proxy for public interest, measured by volume and sentiment of media. Additionally, we evaluate potential links between public interest and the reaction of markets of pollinator-derived products, namely honey. Volume and sentiment of online media surrounding pollinators was quantified for the years 2017 – 2021. Search results show mentions mostly driven by pleasant mentions of bees, honey, honeybee costumes, and butterfly migration rather than topics related to the pollination-related threats, causes, polices, and/or programs. Wholesale and retail prices of honey have been less variable than mentions over time, suggesting no apparent relationship between volume of online media activities surrounding pollinators (including bees) and honey prices. The low volume of mentions about threats towards pollinators may suggest a low level of public awareness of the topic and yield concerns for the effectiveness of polices for protecting pollinators and/or concern for economics of beekeepers, even with the active legislations of the US federal and states government for promoting pollinators health. © 2023","Data analytics; Economics; Markets; Online media; Pollinators"

While online community engagement has been well studied in the existing literature, few studies have explored how older adults behave in online communities. Therefore, drawing upon signaling theory, this study aims to investigate how different content-related and social-related signals influence users’ post replying behavior (i.e., reply to another user's post) in SOCs. We collected 7486 health-related posts and 71,859 comments from one of the most popular Chinese SOCs, Keai (https://www.keai99.com). Information signals in the posts were operationalized using different techniques such as text mining and social network analysis. Results from negative binomial regression indicated that content-related signals (posts’ topic and length) and social-related signals (authors’ position and centrality) were related to replying behavior. In addition, we revealed some differences between the effects of these signals on informational replies and emotional replies. More specifically, compared to posts mentioning traditional Chinese medicine, posts mentioning western medicine received more informational replies, but less emotional replies. Original posts triggered more informational replies, whereas shared posts attracted more emotional replies. Average reply length was positively related to informational replies, but negatively related to emotional replies. Considering the important role of SOCs in satisfying older adults’ social and informational needs, future research is needed to promote user social engagement in SOCs, thereby maintaining their sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Emotional replies; Informational replies; Online user engagement; Post replying behavior; Senior online community"

Therefore, this study aims to explore adolescents' perspectives on the definition of sexting, reasons for engaging, or not, in it, attitudes towards this phenomenon and its possible consequences. Focus groups conducted with 57 adolescents aged 15–19 in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia highlight sexting as a complex phenomenon in which consent is central to understanding it. Adolescents point to sexual gratification and pressure as the most frequent reasons for sending erotic-sexual content, and harming another person and ending a relationship as the most frequent reasons for forwarding without consent. Most of the attitudes reported towards sexting are rejectionist or neutral but, in fact, they are in line with the logic of positive attitudes. Moreover, they denote a high awareness of the possible consequences, both positive and negative. These findings substantially expand knowledge for addressing sexting in psychoeducational programmes by considering the perspective and experience of adolescents' own voice. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Adolescence; Attitudes; Conceptualization; Consequences; Reasons; Sexting"

A popular type of online conversation is threaded conversation, where a person initiates a conversation with a new topic by uploading a post, then others reply to the post or the comments made by other participants in a recursive manner. Even though the growing importance of understanding and predicting the development process of threaded conversations has attracted research community to investigate continuity of online threaded conversations from a perspective of individual posts or comments, little work has focused on predicting the continuity or persistence of online conversations. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model to predict continuity of threaded conversations – whether there will be a newly-arrived comment or not. Cooperating with popular pre-trained text embedding models and graph neural network models, the proposed model captures text, structural, and temporal characteristics of the threaded conversation by an observable time for the final prediction. We evaluate the proposed model with two different types of the threaded conversations, self-introductory Q&A and discussion, which demonstrates that the proposed model can accurately predict the continuity of the conversations regardless of types of threaded conversations. We believe that the proposed methodology and the results can provide the potential insights to advertisers, opinion leaders, or platform designers who want to understand and predict the evolutionary process of threaded conversations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Continuity prediction; Deep learning; Online conversation; Reddit"

The analysis spans the 2011 to 2019 period, during which the share of rural households covered by high-speed broadband increased from 14.5% to 83%. The empirical strategy exploits variations in the timing of network deployment, as well as the fact that several rural areas remained unserved by 2019. To estimate impact, the study uses a semi-parametric alternative to the standard two-way fixed-effects (TWFE) estimator proposed by Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021). Overall, the findings indicate that broadband deployment in rural areas is associated with measurable gains in labor income and employment. Our income model estimates range from an increase of 14% to 21% above the expected level had broadband not been deployed in these areas. The impact estimates on employment are more modest, ranging from 3% to 5% (depending on the specification) above the mean employment level over the study period. Additionally, our results corroborate that ICTs help diversify employment opportunities, as the share of agricultural employment falls in the connected areas. The findings also suggest that the economic benefits associated with broadband favor younger workers, presumably because their skills better match the newly created jobs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Broadband Impact; Difference-in-Difference; Latin America; Rural Development"

Massive virtual protests in several countries showed signs that university students suffered from technostress, questioning the assumption that “digital natives” are better prepared for technology-mediated learning. We analyzed whether one cause of this technostress was the obligation to share home space and family time with studies. We also analyzed whether this technostress affected satisfaction with university life and, ultimately, academic performance. We tested the hypotheses using structural equation modeling and analyzed data from 189 college students. Our main conclusion is that study-family conflict given remote learning affects academic performance in students. The effect of this conflict on performance is mediated by technostress and satisfaction with university life. The perception of invasion and overload due to remote learning causes dissatisfaction with university life in students, and this dissatisfaction decreases academic performance.

The features of online information exchange (e.g., conducted on a massive scale, with an abundance of information and unverified sources) led to various behavioral and psychological responses that are not fully understood. This study therefore investigated the relationship between exposure to online information sources and how individuals sought, forwarded, and provided COVID-19 related information. Anchored in the stimulus-organism-response model, cognitive load theory, and the theory of fear appeal, this study examined the link between the online consumption of COVID-19-related information and psychological and behavioral responses. In the theory development process, we hypothesized the moderating role of levels of fear. The research model included six hypotheses and was empirically verified on self-reported data (N = 425), which was collected in early 2021. The results indicate that continuous exposure to online information sources led to perceived information overload, which further heightened the psychological state of cyberchondria. Moreover, the act of seeking and providing COVID-19 information was significantly predicted by perceived cyberchondria. The results also suggest that higher levels of fear led to increased levels of seeking and providing COVID-19-related information. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are presented, along with promising areas for future research. © 2023","COVID-19; Crisis; Cyberchondria; Fear; Information overload; Information providing; Information seeking"

We conducted a content analysis of popular breast cancer narratives (N = 410) by five influential breast cancer non-profit organizations on Facebook. Based on a theoretical framework grounded in narrative communication research, we analyzed these narratives in the following dimensions: narrative content (e.g., character attributes, events, and mood), narrative form (e.g., perspective and length), literary techniques (e.g., imperatives, metaphors, and celebrity appeals), and visual elements (e.g., the color pink, events, and vividness). Negative binomial and linear regressions were conducted to examine the relationships between narrative characteristics and three types of social media engagement: affective, cognitive, and behavioral engagement. Results showed that cancer stories that were longer, less emotionally intensive, told from the cancer survivor's perspective, with gender identity–related information, describing the act of providing social support, explicitly requesting engagement and/or donation, and using more vivid forms of visuals such as linked images tended to be more engaging. However, different narrative features were associated with the three engagement outcomes differently.

While the effectiveness of endorsement has been frequently examined in the marketing field, it lacks in-depth analysis in scientific crowdfunding. To reveal whether and how endorsement influences scientific crowdfunding performance, we employ signaling theory as a theoretical lens and analyze 1,839 campaigns from Experiment.com. First, the result from propensity score matching method indicates that endorsements generally have a positive effect on scientific crowdfunding performance. Using open coding, we refine the endorsement genre's analytical framework, employing 2 dimensions (project-related and person-related) and 11 relevant attributes. The regression results suggest that clearly stating the implications of the project can significantly affect both fundraising and participation performance. The impacts of the endorser's identity and endorser's agreement on the initiator's ability promote fundraising performance, while the research background and condition statement positively contribute to participation performance. Furthermore, we classify scientific endorsements into three genres: project-focused, person-focused, and balanced. Although the performance of the three types of endorsement genres does not differ significantly, we find that the “person-then-project” pattern is superior to the “project-then-person” pattern in the balanced endorsement genre. In addition, we calculate endorsement sentiment, which is also an essential attribute of the endorsement genre, using a deep learning approach. The regression result suggests that a stronger endorsement sentiment induces a better campaign fundraising performance. In this line, we identify two endorsement genres: high- and low-sentiment endorsements. The campaigns with a high endorsement sentiment have better fundraising and participation performances than those with a low endorsement sentiment. We subsequently discuss the theoretical and practical implications and future research directions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Citizen science; Crowdfunding performance; Endorsement effect; Endorsement genres; Scientific crowdfunding; Signaling theory"

By simulating search query prefixes and calling search engine APIs, 106,896 autocomplete predictions were collected, and their semantic toxicity scores as measures of negative algorithmic bias were computed based on machine learning models. Results indicate that search engine autocomplete algorithmic bias is overall consistent with long-standing societal discrimination. Historically disadvantaged groups such as the female, the Black, and the homosexual suffer higher levels of negative algorithmic bias. Moreover, the degree of algorithmic bias varies across topic categories. Implications about the search engine mediatization, mechanisms and consequences of autocomplete algorithmic bias are discussed. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Algorithm auditing; Algorithmic bias; Autocomplete; Digital inequality; Mediatization; Search engine"

This analysis models the impact of broadband Next Generation Access (NGA) on new business creation at the local level over the 2011–2015 period in England, United Kingdom, using high-resolution panel data. After controlling for a range of factors, we find that faster broadband speeds brought by NGA technologies have a positive effect on the rate of business growth. We find that in England between 2011 and 2015, on average a one percentage increase in download speeds is associated with a 0.0574 percentage point increase in the annual growth rate of business establishments. The primary hypothesised mechanism behind the estimated relationship is the enabling effect that faster broadband speeds have on innovative business models based on new digital technologies and services. Entrepreneurs either sought appropriate locations that offer high quality broadband infrastructure (contributing to new business establishment growth), or potentially enjoyed a competitive advantage (resulting in a higher survival rate). The findings of this study suggest that aspiring to reach universal high–capacity broadband connectivity is economically desirable, especially as the costs of delivering broadband services decline. © 2023","Broadband; Business creation; ICT; Infrastructure; Next generation access"

South Korea has a well-established FinTech infrastructure and resources, and has already incorporated digital financial services into daily life. However, the benefit of the proliferation of FinTech might be disproportionate in reaching diverse groups. The goal of this study is to examine how digital financial services are used in South Korea with an emphasis on disparities in the use of digital financial services. This study used the 2019 Digital Divide Survey conducted in South Korea to conduct OLS regression analysis, and create the Concentration Index (CI), which estimates the disparities that are systematically related to income level. Next, decomposition analysis on the CI was conducted to determine what factors help explain the disparity in the use of digital financial services. The analysis confirmed that there are considerable differences in the usage by income level. The multivariate results reveal that one's device proficiency and active involvement in utilizing the internet for basic activities played significant roles in explaining the level of digital financial services usage. Poorer individuals' attitudes toward new technologies, such as a lack of interest in participating in learning and confidence in obtaining new digital skills, may prevent them from using digital financial services. This study is one of few studies to use the CI technique to examine the digital divide in digital financial services, and provide insights for educators, businesses, and policymakers. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Concentration index; Digital divide; Digital financial services; FinTech; South Korea"

Assessing spatial-emotional interactions is crucial for human-centered urban planning and public mental health. However, prior research has focused on the spatial analysis of every single emotion, ignoring the intricate interactions between multi-emotions and space. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework to reveal the spatial co-occurrence patterns of multi-emotions using massive social media data in Wuhan, China. Specifically, the BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) pre-trained model is utilized to classify each post into one of five basic emotions. Given the implementation of the K-means algorithm on these emotional results, the emotion-based similarities among different grids are investigated. The qualitative and quantitative results reveal six spatial co-occurrence patterns of conflicting or consistent emotions in urban space, namely, happiness-fear, happiness-anger, balanced emotion, happiness dominated, happiness-surprise, and happiness-sadness. In particular, the balanced emotion pattern is the most prevalent and tends to be spatially concentrated in the city center, while patterns of happiness-anger and happiness-sadness are mainly observed in the suburbs. Plus, results of the Multinomial Logit Model (MNLM) indicate that the spatial multi-emotions co-occurrence patterns are significantly correlated with land use characteristics based on points-of-interest (POIs) data. These findings provide an innovative perspective for understanding the complex interactions between emotions and space, with theoretical and practical implications for designing and maintaining an emotionally healthy city. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Emotion classification; Emotions; Land use; Social media data; Spatial co-occurrence patterns; Urban space"

However, it remains unclear by which mechanism and under which conditions dating app use has undesired effects. As a mechanism, we investigated excessive swiping, operationalized as youth's mental preoccupation with profile browsing and swiping compulsivity. As moderators, we investigated swiping in assessment (i.e., critically evaluating profiles), and locomotion (i.e., taking intuitive gut decisions) modes. To this end, we surveyed a quota-sample of 464 transition age dating app users (16–25 years old). Moderated mediation analyses showed that dating app use was associated with excessive swiping, which was in turn linked to a) upward social comparison, b) fear of being single, and c) partner choice overload. In conclusion, frequent dating app use was related to undesired outcomes only when it was related to excessive swiping. Neither assessment, nor locomotion mode moderated these relationships; thus, excessive swiping is detrimental for young dating app users’ well-being, no matter how they swipe. © 2023 The Authors","Online dating; Passive social media use; Problematic smartphone use; Profile browsing; Romantic decision making; Tinder addiction"

Recently, in a situation where AI psychotherapy chatbots were actively employed, this study examines how the degree of anthropomorphism in profile pictures of AI psychotherapy chatbots (company logo, robot character, human character, real human photo) affects user self-disclosure. Furthermore, this study verifies that the relationship between anthropomorphism and self-disclosure is mediated by the user's liking and mind perception towards the chatbot. The study found that the anthropomorphism of the psychotherapy chatbot profile picture did not directly affect the user's self-disclosure, and the higher the degree of anthropomorphism of the profile picture, the more self-disclosure when the user had a favorable feeling for the chatbot. On the other hand, when the user perceived the chatbot to have thoughts and emotions, the higher the degree of anthropomorphism of the profile picture, the lower the degree of self-disclosure.

However, prior studies examining social media timelines revealed that, due to personalisation algorithms, social media users are more likely to encounter attitude-consistent content that reinforces their existing beliefs than information that contradicts them, creating filter bubbles and ultimately hampering their ability to make good decisions. To burst the bubbles, this paper proposes a framework for investigating and measuring the factors that affect personalisation in social media search mechanisms by controlling external noises that can mask the results and be misinterpreted as personalisation. Upon conducting a comprehensive set of experiments with Twitter as our study social media platform, we observed that users’ followees, cookies, and carry-over effect play a role in shaping personalised search results. While the extent of their influence is relatively limited, they can still lead to the introduction of biases, consequently affecting users’ opinions and judgements. In addition, the experiments also shed light on the fact that searches on polarised issues can lead to unwarranted one-sided inclinations in the results. Lastly, we argue in favour of alleviating the multifaceted societal and ethical consequences of algorithmic personalisation through encouraging users to develop healthy social media use habits and by urging social media platforms as well as policymakers to actively work towards fostering a more diverse and reliable online information ecosystem. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Filter bubble; Personalisation algorithms; Search mechanism; Social media"

Specifically, our paper conducts a nationwide assessment of the relationship between broadband and new business activity, in the early years of broadband in the late 1990s/early 2000s when it had the most potential to disrupt industries and open up new entrepreneurial opportunities. Using an instrumental variables approach based on the development of the Internet by the U.S. military, we estimate the impact of broadband availability on total and net new business creation. Results suggest that access to broadband was associated with an increase in new business activity and net creation of new businesses. We also find evidence that access to broadband was important in the creation of businesses in knowledge- oriented industries who benefited from the rise of the Internet. At the same time, we also find broadband may have crowded out business activity in the manufacturing industry. Combined, our results suggest disruptive innovations related to broadband Internet connections are important for small business creation in many, but not all industries.

In this study, we present a comprehensive model to understand user engagement with AI tools, specifically focusing on ChatGPT. The model is grounded on four primary stages, each containing distinct variables: 1) fundamental (comprising perceived intelligence and system quality), 2) knowledge and service (covering knowledge acquisition, application, personalization, and trust), 3) gain with user tendency (encompassing utilitarian benefits, individual impact, satisfaction, and personal innovativeness), and 4) behavior (including behavioral intention, continued usage, and Word-of-Mouth (WOM)). A total of 13 variables have been examined. A survey was conducted on a sample of 645 university students and office workers, and the collected data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results reveal significant associations between perceived intelligence and knowledge management, and personalization. System quality also significantly impacts knowledge management and personalization. Knowledge acquisition and application were found to significantly affect utilitarian benefits and individual impact, but not satisfaction. Personalization significantly influenced utilitarian benefits, individual impact, and satisfaction. Trust significantly impacts behavioral intention. Utilitarian benefits and individual impact had a positive effect on satisfaction, behavioral intention, and WOM. Personal innovativeness was significantly associated with behavioral intention. Behavioral intention significantly affected usage and WOM, while usage did not significantly associate with WOM. Among control variables, only age affects behavioral intention.

The findings also showed that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep involvement with AI-based technologies in the use. Further, individuals with higher motivation and skills to use AI technologies are likely to have a pleasant experience after using these technologies. © 2023 The Author(s)","AI Literacy; ChatGPT; Cognitive Absorption; Computational Thinking; Digital Divide"

For instance, jealousy induced by the partner's activity on social media can cause conflicts that can escalate into controlling and aggressive behaviors. Previous cross-sectional studies show significant links between social media jealousy and intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration. However, the directionality of these associations has not yet been examined using longitudinal designs. This study investigated the associations between social media jealousy and IPV perpetration in young adults’ romantic relationships over a year. Two samples, one composed of 112 couples (n = 224) and one composed of 286 individuals involved in a romantic relationship, completed online questionnaires at two time points over one year. Results of cross-lagged panel analyses were replicated across samples and suggested that the intra-individual association between social media jealousy and IPV perpetration is bidirectional and positive over time. Results also indicated a negative association between a person's IPV perpetration at Time 1 and their partner's online jealousy at Time 2. These findings highlight the reciprocal and dyadic influences of social media jealousy and IPV and provide a better understanding of the potential risks associated with social media use in young adults’ romantic relationships. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Couple; Intimate partner violence; Jealousy; Longitudinal; Social media; Young adults"

Based on the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) framework, we developed a research model to understand the effects of vaccine safety news and risk news from social media (external stimuli) on individuals’ psychological organism (i.e., safety perception and risk perception) and consequent behavioral response, vaccine hesitancy and vaccination behavior. The proposed model was tested by partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) on a sample gathered in China from September 2021 to November 2021 and from February 2022 to April 2022 (valid responses = 1579). The results found that the relationship between vaccine risk news from social media and risk perception was higher than the relationship between vaccine safety news from social media and safety perception. Individuals are more sensitive to vaccine risk news than safety news on social media. Moreover, both safety perception and risk perception explained the critical psychological mechanisms behind vaccine hesitancy. Interestingly, ego network density mitigated the effect of safety news on safety perception and the effect of risk news on risk perception. The findings contribute to the S-O-R model, the research on social media effects, and the literature on vaccination attitudes and behaviors. This study also informs public health officials about leveraging the power of social media to motivate the public to accept the COVID-19 vaccines. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Ego network density; Risk perception; Safety perception; Social media news; The S-O-R framework; Vaccine hesitancy"

As a result, there has been a surge of interest and research towards user acceptance of AI technology in recent years. However, the existing research appears dispersed and lacks systematic synthesis, limiting our understanding of user acceptance of AI technologies. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and meta-Analysis guidelines using five databases: EBSCO host, Embase, Inspec (Engineering Village host), Scopus, and Web of Science. Papers were required to focus on both user acceptance and AI technology. Acceptance was defined as the behavioural intention or willingness to use, buy, or try a good or service. A total of 7912 articles were identified in the database search. Sixty articles were included in the review. Most studies (n = 31) did not define AI in their papers, and 38 studies did not define AI for their participants. The extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was the most frequently used theory to assess user acceptance of AI technologies. Perceived usefulness, performance expectancy, attitudes, trust, and effort expectancy significantly and positively predicted behavioural intention, willingness, and use behaviour of AI across multiple industries. However, in some cultural scenarios, it appears that the need for human contact cannot be replicated or replaced by AI, no matter the perceived usefulness or perceived ease of use. Given that most of the methodological approaches present in the literature have relied on self-reported data, further research using naturalistic methods is needed to validate the theoretical model/s that best predict the adoption of AI technologies. © 2022 The Author(s)","AI; Human factors; Machine learning; Psychosocial models; Social robotics; User acceptance"

Recommender systems that are based on the conventional Collaborative Filtering (CF) approach rely on single customers’ ratings on retailing websites. Multi-criteria CF (MCCF) approaches that rely on multi-aspects of the products have provided more reliable and effective recommendations on retailing websites. However, these approaches should be improved in terms of accuracy by solving sparsity issues and incorporating criteria ratings. In addition, most of the recommendation agents that are based on MCCF cannot learn automatically from the features of the products to model customers’ preferences and generate accurate recommendations on retailing websites. Besides, although previous studies have utilized single and multi-criteria ratings in recommendation agents of tourism websites, still, if there is a lack of ratings of items, most of these systems will fail to generate accurate recommendations to users. In this research, we develop a new recommendation agent based on a MCCF approach to effectively improve the performance of previous recommendation systems for tourism websites.

Studies on social media addictions have been emerging across different fields, including psychology, behavioral science, and computer science. To investigate the evolution and development of the research on social media addiction (SMA), this paper constituted a bibliometric analysis of 396 articles published from 2011 to 2021. Through a cluster analysis of keywords, we identified five SMA research focuses: the influences of negative and dark personality traits (the dark triad); adolescents mental and physical health problems caused by fear of missing out; self-control under habit-driven addiction; excessive social media use induced by social anxiety; the health and behaviors in cross-addictions. We also find that the collaborative networks among authors and institutions were concentrated without significantly groupings, indicating the collaborative efficiency in SMA studies while the concentration may lead the research topics to converge. Our results show that researchers have built branches of theories to explain the prefactors of SMA, while most theories tend to pathologize SMA with personal prefactors. In the future, researchers need to find more factors other than personal characteristics in order to increase the connections of SMA research with the other fields. Researchers also need to discuss more user behaviors not motivated by social needs in order to keep up with the diversified developments of social media. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Bibliometric analysis; Co-authorship analysis; Co-citation analysis; Internet addiction; Keywords co-occurrence analysis; Literature review; Social media addiction; Social networks"

The findings suggested different mechanisms for CDE-CPA and political consumerism. We found that weekday social media usage is positively associated with CDE-CPA but negatively associated with buycotting. Also, extraverted individuals prefer to engage in CDE-CPA activities but not political consumerism; and emotionally stable individuals tend to engage in buycotting and high-CDE activities to support corporate political advocacy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Big Five personality traits; Boycotting; Buycotting; Consumer digital engagement; Corporate political advocacy; Political consumerism"

This research seeks to unveil the salient factors that affect the efficacy of mobile advertising in driving purchase intention by expanding the Web Advertising Model to include additional mobile advertising attributes (i.e., credibility and incentive) while considering the role of brand attitude in the process. A cross-sectional study was conducted with quantitative data obtained from 300 eligible respondents through an offline questionnaire survey. The empirical data were subsequently validated using the Structural Equation Modelling Artificial Neural Network (SEM-ANN) method to determine the non-compensatory non-linear relationships. All four ANN models show consistent results with the SEM analysis. The results indicate that consumer perceptions and expectations toward mobile advertising have shifted over time, such that the qualities of informativeness, irritation, and entertainment no longer play a critical role in determining mobile advertising value. On the other hand, the credibility and incentive of mobile advertising were found to be far more crucial in swaying such evaluations. Moreover, mobile advertising value was found to positively affect consumer attitudes towards the mobile advertisement and the advertised brand, which ultimately leads to purchase intention. This study offers an insightful overview of the modern mobile advertising environment that practitioners may use as a handy guide to optimise their mobile advertising strategies to suit the current perceptions and expectations of consumers. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",""

In the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, eWOM has been an effective tool for knowledge sharing and decision making. This research aims to reveal what factors of eWOM can influence travelers’ trust in their decision-making to travel during the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, we aim to find the relationships between trust in eWOM and perceived risk, and perceived risk and the decision to travel. These relationships are investigated based on online customers’ reviews in TripAdvisor's COVID-19 forums. We use a two-stage data analysis which includes cluster analysis and structural equation modeling. In the first stage, a questionnaire survey was designed and the data was collected from 1546 respondents by referring to the COVID-19 forums on TripAdvisor. Specifically, we use k-means to segment the users’ data into different groups. In the second stage, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was performed to inspect the relations between the variables in the hypothesized research model using a subsample of 679 respondents. The results of the first stage of the analysis showed that three segments could be discovered from the collected data for trust based on eWOM source and eWOM message attributes. These segments clearly showed that there are significant relationships between trust and perceived risk, and between perceived risk and the decision to travel. The results in all segments showed that users with a low level of trust have a high level of perceived risk and a low level of intention to travel during the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, it was found that users with a high level of e-trust have a low level of perceived risk and a high level of intention to travel. These results were confirmed in all segments and these relationships were confirmed by SEM. The results of SEM revealed that visual and external information moderated the relationship between eWOM length and trust, and experience moderated the relationship between trust and perceived risk. For the moderating role of gender, it was found that the perceived risk has a higher impact on the decision to travel in the female sample. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19 outbreak; Electronic word of mouth; Knowledge sharing; Perceived risk; Travel plan; Trust"

How the public perceives the COVID-19 vaccine is directly associated with vaccine compliance and vaccination coverage. This study takes a cultural sensitivity perspective and adopts two well-known social media platforms in the United States (Twitter) and China (Weibo) to conduct a public perception comparison around the COVID-19 vaccine. By implementing semantic network analysis, results demonstrate that the two countries' social media users overlapped in themes concerning domestic vaccination policies, priority groups, challenges from COVID-19 variants, and the global pandemic situation. However, Twitter users were prone to disclose individual vaccination experiences, express anti-vaccine attitudes. In comparison, Weibo users manifested evident deference to authorities and exhibited more positive feelings toward the COVID-19 vaccine. Those disparities were explained by the cultural characteristics' differences between the two countries.

Drawn from the “computers as social actors” (CASA) paradigm and the extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), we proposed and empirically tested the consumer-VA trust model, in which trust serves as a second-order construct with three first-order dimensions (i.e., competence, integrity, and self-efficacy). In addition, the relationships among consumer-VA trust, consumer perceptions, and behavioral intention were examined. Using a survey with 192 usable responses, our research indicated that consumer-VA trust positively impacts perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment, which in turn increase consumers’ intention to continue use of VAs.

Data were collected during Belgium's first and strictest lockdown. The results largely confirmed the applicability of the PWM in a public health context. Posting of and exposure to anti-governmental social media messages positively related to violations of the regulations via higher descriptive norm perceptions of peers violating the measures and positive attitudes towards violations. Pro-governmental media interactions (i.e., exposure to news media and pro-governmental social media messages) negatively related to violations via negative attitudes towards violations. No support emerged for the role of (televised) series, prototype favorability, or subjective norms in the PWM. Differences in posting versus exposure of social media messages were found.

Furthermore, the application of core tags, which can represent the tacit rules and platform vernaculars co-defined by the community members, improved performance noticeably more than using peripheral tags. Interestingly, among the core tags, those that possessed linguistic idiosyncrasies particularly contributed to high performance. The findings highlight the complex contingencies of social tagging structures and functions and provide practical implications for users and platforms to strategically manage tag-based networked publics. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Core-periphery; Expertise; Hashtag; Networked publics; Networks; Tag"

In this paper, we define a novel data model to represent heterogeneous entities and their relationships within Social Reviewing Systems, whose analysis based on meta-paths, satisfying specific temporal and content constraints, allows us to efficiently and effectively compute the influence exerted by a user on another one.

This study responds to a call for rediscovering the role of socioeconomic status (SES) by investigating the quadratic moderation effects of SES on associations between the use of alternative sources and misinformation exposure and susceptibility. Poisson regression models were fitted with the data coming from an online survey with 955 Chinese respondents. Findings show that the moderation effects are quadratic when income, rather than educational attainment, serves as the measurement of SES. The implications of the findings with respect to overeducation, income's cognitive effects, and the non-equivalence of SES's common measures in studies of media effects are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Alternative sources; Media effects; Moderation; Socioeconomic status"

Previous research on internet use among people with disabilities has compared the internet access and use of people with and without disabilities, has investigated general benefits and risks associated with internet use for people with ID, or has examined how their internet skills and use can be improved. The present study aims to examine whether differences can be found in varying aspects of internet access, use purposes, skills and use support among a group of people with ID. Face-to-face survey data were collected among 94 people with ID (57.4% men; Mage = 45.28, SDage = 12.20). Our study revealed that particularly younger people with ID have more access, use the internet for more different purposes, have more skills and report to be more supported when they encounter problems compared to older people with ID. We further found that employed persons with ID have higher skills than unemployed ones, and that people who rely less on professional caregivers have more skills than those who rely more on professional caregivers. Given these results, we suggest that people with ID should be considered as a heterogeneous group of internet users. Consequently, we recommend organizations and caregivers to differentiate when teaching or applying internet use among this population. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Digital divide; Heterogeneous internet users; Intellectual disability; Internet use; Survey study; Within-group differences"

Although the impact of failed niches is inconsequential compared to that of successful niches, regime actors can still interact and reinforce mutual stability within the existing regime and make either a positive or a negative impact even after the failed niches disappear. This study explains the effects of the failed niche, which attempted transition to a new socio-technical system, from a novel perspective.

However, previous studies on public emotions in the crisis usually focused on the classification, communication, and influence factors of emotions, while omitting the dynamic system of group emotional expression. In this study, we calculate the emotional tendency based on Sentiment Knowledge Enhanced Pre-training for Sentiment Analysis (SKEP). The emotional time series are constructed and the stationarity and randomness of the series are investigated. The largest Lyapunov exponent is employed to analyze the chaos of the emotional time series. The major findings suggest that the phenomenon of public opinion is a process system from the perspective of cybernetics, and the expression of group emotions is a continuous process of this system. The expression of group emotions presents various characteristics at different periods. The emotional time series of the initial period is generated by a stochastic system. Then a chaotic system dominates the group emotional expression in the outbreak period. In the chronic period, the expression process is dominated by a stable non-chaotic system. This study provides a new perspective for the research on the evolution of public opinion, solving the confusion about the concepts of object and process. The findings of this study can help the emergency management departments understand the dynamic mechanism of group emotional expression in the crisis, and provide theoretical support for the guidance and decision-making in emergency response. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Crisis; Dynamic mechanism; Group emotional expression; Time series"

Results of Multiple Hierarchical Regression reveal that all the Components of conventional TV have no significant correlation with the users’ socio-demographics. For OTT platforms, users’ family income shows a substantial correlation with the relaxation and convenience component. Except for the convenience component, the scores of niche breadth for all components of Conventional TV were found to be higher than those of OTT platforms. The competitive superiority of Conventional TV was found to be higher than OTT platforms in all the gratification components except the convenience component. Results show that the financial benefit and relaxation are the strongest niches for Conventional TV, while the convenience component exposed the strongest niche for OTT platforms.

Countries have become more reliant on digitalization. As a result, a fascinating question is how digitalized service levels among global economies shape the relationship with DST exports. This paper investigates the interlinks among the variables influencing DST exports. Data from 71 countries worldwide over 2005–2019 are considered for our study. We introduce Porter's diamond model to explore the determinants of expanding DST exports and investigate the mechanism of all determinants on DST exports. The global principal component analysis (GPCA) method is employed to evaluate the indicator of digitalized service level. Subsequently, we examine the impact of digitalized service level on DST exports through the two-way fixed-effect approach with the panel model. Analysis reveals that a higher level of digitalized service significantly impacts DST exports across global economies. In contrast, there is an adverse effect for middle-income countries and no effect for low-income countries. Based on these findings, we propose policy recommendations for improving DST exports, focusing on the digital service level, market demand, related and supporting industry, foreign direct investment, marketing policy, and chance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Diamond model; Digital service trade; Digital technology; Digitized service levels"

In contrast to the hypothesis presented in this study, fear of negative evaluation showed a positive influence on SNS impression management. Finally, SNS impression management had a positive influence on willingness to speak out.

This pandemic has led, mainly due to conditions related to confinement, to major changes in consumer habits and behaviors. Although there have been several studies on the analysis of customers’ satisfaction through survey-based and online customers’ reviews, the impact of COVID-19 on customers' satisfaction has not been investigated so far. It is important to investigate dimensions of satisfaction from the online customers’ reviews to reveal their preferences on the hotels' services during the COVID-19 outbreak. This study aims to reveal the travelers’ satisfaction in Malaysian hotels during the COVID-19 outbreak through online customers’ reviews. In addition, this study investigates whether service quality during COVID-19 has an impact on hotel performance criteria and consequently customers' satisfaction. Accordingly, we develop a new method through machine learning approaches. The method is developed using text mining, clustering, and prediction learning techniques. We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for big data analysis to identify the voice-of-the-customer, Expectation-Maximization (EM) for clustering, and ANFIS for satisfaction level prediction. In addition, we use Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) for missing value imputation. The data was collected from TripAdvisor regarding the travelers’ concerns in the form of online reviews on the COVID-19 outbreak and numerical ratings on hotel services from different perspectives. The results from the analysis of online customers’ reviews revealed that service quality during COVID-19 has an impact on hotel performance criteria and consequently customers' satisfaction.

While most Americans have access to some form of broadband internet connection, the bandwidth, quality of service (QoS), and choice of providers remain highly variable throughout the country. For example, while the residents of many urban areas can choose between gigabit fiber, cable, or digital subscriber line connections from multiple providers, residents in rural areas often suffer from limited platform and provider choices. A fundamental problem with developing effective public policy for broadband in the U.S. is the lack of reliable data for estimating the geographic coverage of broadband service. This paper aims to highlight how data uncertainty can negatively impact coverage estimations in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. The state of California serves as our study area. This paper suggests a combination of uncertain broadband data combined with Census data errors co-mingle to create a variable snapshot of local broadband provision and geographic coverage.

These games augment geographical areas with playful content, which makes the playing experience dependent on both the game and the playing location. Existing games have employed various methods for increasing the connection between the game and the physical world, such as (1) an AR mode that lets players see virtual objects in the physical world through the lens of their mobile device; and (2) connecting the game's virtual points of interest (PoIs) to physical world objects. To explore how these influence the playing experience, we surveyed players (N = 74) across four popular location-based AR games. We analyzed the data using a thematic clustering approach, which resulted in five central themes. Among our findings was that only 7% of the surveyed players regularly used or appreciated AR features that made use of the mobile device's camera. The most often given reason for this was that they slow down progression. By contrast, players appreciated location-based features and the augmentation of digital content on a map interface. Connecting the virtual content to physical world objects was seen to have the benefits of (1) supporting social meetings; (2) enabling learning about the real world; and (3) increasing the meaningfulness of the virtual content. © 2021 The Author(s)","AR; Augmented reality; Geo games; Location-based games; Point of interest"

To deal with the large volume of extreme opinions, companies, and PR authorities spent heavily on soothing the tension and sheltering customer word-of-mouth from devasting reviews by feeding public overloaded information, dominating public attention and grabbing new headlines, yet very few studies rationalize this assumption. This paper develops simulation experiments to unmask the aforementioned relations, in particular, how information environment (i.e., information preference and noise), individual factors (i.e., acceptance threshold, halo effect), and institutional efforts (i.e., promotion) affect the customer review's evolution at the aggregate level. The findings suggest that the evolution of opinion in divergence can occur in any preference-held audience whereas the information noise can substantially moderate the information valence and cause the polarized voices to get mild dramatically. In addition, a halo effect on the information source can stir the voice to be amplified by the influencer. The experimental results indicate the significance of understanding information valence and group conformity in conversational contexts and find a few clues of improving communication effects. This research bears high originality in explaining how public opinions evolve in a belief-neutral environment via audience-sensitive, context-bound, objective-manipulated techniques.

Using a virtual agent-based infrastructure, we systematically collect search outputs for six conspiracy theory-related queries (“flat earth”, “new world order”, “qanon”, “9/11”, “illuminati”, “george soros”) across three locations (two in the US and one in the UK) and two waves (March and May 2021). We find that all search engines except Google consistently displayed conspiracy-promoting results and returned links to conspiracy-dedicated websites, with variations across queries. Most conspiracy-promoting results came from social media and conspiracy-dedicated websites while conspiracy-debunking information was shared by scientific websites and legacy media. These observations are consistent across different locations and time periods highlighting the possibility that some engines systematically prioritize conspiracy-promoting content. © 2022 The Author(s)","Algorithm auditing; Conspiracy theories; Information distribution; Political communication; Web search"

Unlike their counterparts in mature democracies and outright authoritarian states, citizens of new democracies face the challenge to reconcile their democratic present with the authoritarian past. Their online political behaviors therefore are likely to be shaped by the interaction between democratic realities and authoritarian legacies or memories. The current study argues that in new democracies, the relationship between credibility of new media and OPE is contingent upon citizens’ authoritarian experience. Since authoritarian experience delivers a sense of relative acquisition through a comparison mechanism, it is expected to play a positive role in moderating the association between credibility of new media and OPE. We test the proposition by studying a sample of Taiwanese residents interviewed during the 2015 Taiwan Communication Survey (TCS). Our empirical analyses produce strong supportive evidence for the positive conditioning effect of authoritarian experience and the result is robust to different model specifications and alternative measures of authoritarian experience. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Authoritarian experience; New democracies; Online political efficacy; Taiwan"

However, the extent to which the pandemic may have a lasting effect on people's daily life and work remains to be seen. Poor visual and acoustic quality of online meetings could reactivate old communication patterns in the long term. New technologies such as 6G and 3D holography, offering enhanced video quality and online experience, could further drive virtualization in communication. This article investigates the CO2 mitigation potential resulting from the partial replacement of business travel by 6G-enabled 3D videoconferencing in Germany in 2030. The carbon footprint calculation combined with scenario analysis has shown significant results when direct and indirect energy effects are considered. In the different scenarios investigated, a virtual conference would cause between 0.2% and 0.9% of the emissions of a mean-distance conference trip taken by a German business traveler. Considering the mitigation potential of all German conference travel in 2030, emissions could be decreased by 2.1 MtCO2eq (8.9%) and 20.5 MtCO2eq (88.4%), respectively, compared to 2019 under conservative and optimistic assumptions. In terms of current national total emissions, increasing virtualization of conferences could contribute between 0.3% and 2.8% to the German mitigation efforts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","3D holography; 6G network; Business travel; Carbon mitigation; Scenario analysis; Virtualization"

However, more digitally developed countries have shown a reduction of Internet use. This article examines the changes in Internet use in 2020 as the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic focused on cross-country digital development. We use a random effects regression model to assess the relationship between Internet use as an indicator of digital divide and digital development on the macro, business, infrastructural, and individual levels in EU countries. Panel data from Eurostat for 2014–2020 are applied. We found that more digitally developed EU countries, including Estonia, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway, show a higher relationship between Internet usage and digital performance than other EU countries. These countries saw a decrease in Internet use during 2020, which is contrary to the general trend of either increasing or unchanging Internet use in the case of social distancing restrictions and lockdowns. High digital dependence in more digitally developed countries, and in some other EU countries in the context of a pandemic as a crisis, has led to a reduction in Internet use due to the vulnerability of digitalized industries, enterprises, jobs and personal patterns that may identify the new challenge as inverted digital divide. © 2022","Covid-19 pandemic; Digital dependence; Digital development; Digital divide; European Union; Internet use; Panel data"

A three-phase between-subject experiment (N = 543) was conducted to compare the persuasive effects of inoculation messages combined with different eWOM content (self-generated, other-generated, and inoculation only) over two health topics (Covid-19 vaccine and e-cigarette). The results show that exposure to inoculation messages did not significantly increase resistance to misinformation. But inoculation messages combined with other-generated eWOM helped the participants develop more negative attitudes toward alternative smoking immediately after exposure to the inoculation stimuli. The participants who wrote eWOM after exposure to inoculation messages were more resistant to the attack of misinformation in Phase 3. Self-generated and other-generated eWOM did not significantly differ in their persuasive effects in any phases.

In these highly competitive heterogeneous markets, it becomes crucial to reach consumers in an easy, low-cost and more targeted manner. Social media advertising is one of the effective ways of attracting potential customers, retaining attention of current customers and influencing them through persuasive content. Despite its plentiful and obvious advantages, the variation among consumers’ responses to social media advertising remains as a major challenge. Hence, this study aims to identify different consumer segments based on the social media advertising features, discover differences in their individual traits, and examine variation among those segments in terms of the factors that predict their purchase intentions. By utilizing cluster analysis, consumers are segmented according to their perceptions regarding social media advertising features: perceived relevance, performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, informativeness, and interactiveness. It is revealed that consumers are grouped under three segments, namely: “susceptible”, “dispassionate”, and “impervious”. It is found that there are statistically significant differences among these segments in terms of being easily persuaded, impulse buying tendency, self-confidence, and social network proneness in which consumers in “susceptible” segment are more easily persuaded, have high level of self-confidence, have more impulse buying tendency, and are more prone to social networks when compared to other groups. It is also discovered that there are differences among these segments in terms of the factors that determine their purchase intentions for the products presented in social media advertising. The purchase intention of consumers in “susceptible” segment for products exhibited in social media advertising, is determined by perceived relevance, ease of being persuaded, self-confidence and social network proneness. On the other hand, the purchase intention of consumers in the “dispassionate” segment is shaped by informativeness, ease of being persuaded, and social network proneness. Finally, the purchase intention of consumers in “impervious” segment is influenced by hedonic motivation, perceived relevance, impulse buying tendency, and ease of being persuaded. Nevertheless, when the whole sample is considered, it is observed that consumers’ purchase intentions for the products and services presented in social media advertising are influenced by the following factors: perceived relevance, performance expectancy, informativeness, impulse buying tendency, ease of being persuaded, and social network proneness. Understanding differences across segments can help companies design, manage and convey their social media advertising campaigns to their target audience in a convincing, timely, effective, and efficient way, which in turn, let them gain competitive advantage in highly volatile and dynamic markets. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cluster analysis; Purchase intention; Segmentation; Social media advertising; Social network advertising; Social networking sites (SNS)"

Despite accumulating discussion, only a small number of studies have applied the cognitive-behavior model of addiction (Davis, 2001) as a theoretical basis to examine the underlying mechanisms of smartphone addiction. According to CBM explanations, pre-existing psychosocial problems along with cognitive factors lead to smartphone addiction. A few recent studies have examined the roles of distal factors (i.e., psychosocial variables) on smartphone addiction. However, these studies did not consider the proximal cause (i.e., cognitive variable), which is the sufficient factor contributing to addiction. Therefore, this study addresses this gap in the literature by applying CBM to uncover both the distal (leisure boredom and fear of missing out) and proximal causes (extended self) of smartphone addiction. 777 young adults aged 18–35 years were surveyed in this study.

While barriers to acceptance in terms of privacy and trust are well understood when considered separately, they are hardly investigated in conjunction so far. We conducted a quantitative study using Adaptive Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis via an online questionnaire. We explored how aspects of privacy and trust determine the willingness to use smart homes from the perspective of (future) users (n = 137, 18 to 64 years of age), and also with respect to the level of automation and application field. Results show that semi-automated systems are rather preferred than fully automated smart home technology. The perceived reliability of automation is the most important acceptance determinant, followed by the location of data storage. Whereas the awareness to use (e.g., recommendations), the type of data, and application field are less important factors for the overall willingness to use smart homes.

Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to mitigate many of the challenges brought about by the pandemic, which has spurred increased adoption. However, relatively low adoption overall and limited software still restrict the power of VR to address COVID-19 difficulties effectively. This study examines how the perceived impacts of COVID-19 might lead to different VR uses and gratifications and device ownership / variability. Furthermore, we investigate the importance of social interactivity within VR for increasing adoption intentions. We surveyed 298 Amazon Mechanical Turk users during the Fall of 2020. Results indicate that the pandemic's perceived impacts influenced the likelihood of acquiring VR for education, tourism, and work. For VR ownership and variability, those who purchased VR during the pandemic were more likely to report buying it for work. Those with access to high-end VR hardware were more likely to report a broader range of uses, including socializing, health, and telemedicine. Validating the importance of various applications during the pandemic, we found that the desire for social interactivity mediates the impacts of COVID-19 on future adoption intentions. Theoretically, we propose several gratifications sought via the use of VR during the pandemic. Practically, we discuss recommendations for future VR research, marketing, and software design. © 2021 The Authors","COVID-19; Pandemic; Uses and gratifications theory; Virtual reality; VR"

In fact, studies showed that different ways of using the smartphone might influence loneliness, and as a consequence, loneliness might also enhance further engagement with the smartphone. In this context, parents play an important role because they can regulate children's smartphone use. The present study tested the moderating role of active and restrictive parental mediation on the relations between different types of smartphone use and children's loneliness. We conducted a two-wave panel survey among 10- to 14-year-old children and their parents, resulting in total of 384 parent–child pairs at Time 2. Our results revealed that non-communicative use at Time 1 increased loneliness at Time 2. We also found a reciprocal influence, that is, loneliness at Time 1 increased children's non-communicative use at Time 2.

To cope with this challenge, online commerce companies often use information systems to promote interactive communication between sellers and buyers. This study examines how such seller-buyer interactivity affects buyers’ purchase intention in an online commerce context of accommodation sharing. In particular, we use text mining techniques to analyze guest reviews and host responses on Airbnb. Our analysis suggests that not only the quantity but also the quality of the response messages matter: potential guests’ purchase intention increases with the relevance and richness of the host's responses as well as their volume. Further, we find a notable nonlinearity in the quantity effect that the volume of host responses significantly affects guest purchase intention only when it is large enough. Making sufficient responses, the hosts could enjoy complementarity between the quantity and quality effects of their responses; otherwise, the relative richness of their responses becomes more important. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Interactivity; Online Commerce; Online reviews; Purchase intention; Text analysis; Uncertainty"

Participants (N = 490; Mage = 20.31 years, SD = 3.76) recruited from high schools and universities completed a self-report survey assessing the three authentic personality traits, selfitis behaviors, and social media addiction. Results generally confirmed the supposed pathways. Direct and indirect effects on social media addiction were discussed by integrating the two mechanisms of compensation related to individual dispositions with the online self-idealizing and authentic self-expression hypothesis underlying selfitis behaviors. Whereas self-alienation was found to have positive direct and indirect effects on increasing of the likelihood of becoming addicted to social media, both traits of the tendency to accept external influence and authenticity showed indirect effects in opposite directions on the risk of addictive use of social media.

From an analytic approach to fan demand for sport tournaments, the authors examined the demand shifters motivating fans to follow social media accounts within the context of the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I Men's Basketball Championship. Changes in the number of followers of participating teams’ Twitter accounts were tracked daily during the tournament as a proxy for fan interest and demand. Independent variables regarding game performance, previous performance, and school performance were analyzed in a regression model. The findings indicated that, during the tournament, fans' social media following behavior was different from the behavior during the regular season games. Further, there were shifts in fans’ social media following behavior in the advanced rounds compared to earlier rounds in a tournament setting.

On the one hand, technological development and expansion in Wi-Fi coverage can reduce cellular data usage. On the other hand, Wi-Fi offloading, which entails redirecting cellular traffic to a Wi-Fi network, can prevent network quality degradation as a result of explosive cellular traffic. Thus, the advancement and expansion of public Wi-Fi are both beneficial and detrimental for MNOs. Therefore, in this study, we analyze consumer preferences based on changes in the properties of Wi-Fi and cellular networks by employing a mixed logit model with stated preference data. The results indicate high consumer preference when the cellular and Wi-Fi networks are fast, Wi-Fi usability range is wide, and price is low. To analyze the impact of improving public Wi-Fi technology on MNOs, we conduct a scenario analysis. When the Wi-Fi service speed increases to 100 Mbps or more and its coverage expands to span an entire public transportation area, consumers reduce the amount of their monthly cell phone plan by 1347 Korean won (KRW) (1.15 USD) and 5141 KRW (4.40 USD), respectively. The results of this study can facilitate the determination of appropriate public Wi-Fi speeds, establish the quality of cellular networks by considering the effect on MNOs, and improve social welfare by expanding public Wi-Fi networks. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Cellular phone; Mixed logit; Mobile network operator; Public Wi-Fi; Wi-Fi offloading"

Nonetheless, there is a growing concern that personalization in URS's enforce urban filter bubbles. Existing research on this topic is still limited, especially methodologically. One problem is the use of a limited set of distance measures for analyzing differences between item sets returned by URS's under different conditions. Another problem is the lack of advanced analysis models for investigating and comparing the relative impact of different conditions on returned item sets. In this paper, we explore the use of different set distance and geospatial distance measures and multivariate distance matrix regression (MDMR) to assess the relative impact of different determinants of item sets. The analysis of data collected from Google Maps yielded more nuanced conclusions about filter bubbles and personalization when geospatial distance measures were used. Also, search language rather than search location is found to dominantly predict which items URS's return. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Geospatial distances; Multivariate distance matrix regression; Personalization; Set distances; Urban recommender systems"

There is also a limited understanding of the factors that influence the mobilizing or reinforcing role of incidental news exposure in this process. This study examines the role of incidental news exposure on social media in political interest-driven participatory gaps in Singapore. It also examines how education, social network size, and heterogeneous political discussions further modify the effect of incidental news on the participatory gaps between high and low political interest groups. Findings from primary survey data support the reinforcement thesis, suggesting that politically disinterested individuals are negatively affected by frequent incidental news exposure, but those with high political interest benefit. Moderated moderation analyses indicate that these participatory gaps only exist at higher education levels and within more extensive social networks. Further, politically disinterested citizens are at risk for further disengagement if they encounter news accidentally in bigger social networks or engage in heterogeneous political discussion. The study contributes to the growing scholarship on the effects of incidental news exposure on political participation by highlighting the role of education and social network characteristics in amplifying the incidental news-based participation gaps. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Accidental news; Heterogenous discussion; Incidental news; Network size; Participatory gaps; Political interest"

Following the privacy paradox, which occurs when online services are increasingly accepted or used despite raising the level of privacy concerns of individuals, there is no need to alleviate individual privacy concerns regarding online services. Accordingly, this study aims to empirically analyze the effect of online privacy concerns, when interacting with individual innovativeness, on individual online service use behavior. For the empirical analysis, a Heckman two-step analysis is performed using South Korean data from the 2019 Korea Media Panel Survey conducted by the Korea Information Society Development Institute. The results provide evidence in contradiction of the privacy paradox. Specifically, the main findings of this study are as follows. First, use of online services and privacy concerns are not a contradictory phenomenon both in principle and behavior but can act as a negative influence or constraint. Second, individuals with high levels of innovativeness actively use online services owing to differences in their acceptance and use of innovation. Third, as online activities become more common, privacy concerns are likely to affect the level of online service use by interacting with other personality traits. As a result, privacy concerns are more likely to act as an influencing variable that moderates the degree or intensity of an individual's use of an online service rather than an independent variable for the use of an online service. The impact of privacy concerns of individuals on the use of online services identified in this study suggests there is a need for an adequate governing mechanism for privacy protection to realize service provision through e-government. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","E-government; Individual innovativeness; Online privacy concern; Online service use behavior; Privacy paradox"

Originally, AI was first developed to assist humans to complete tasks, but AI now takes on more social roles, such as functioning as a companion. However, little is known about how individuals view these different types of AI. Thus, the present study conducted an online experiment to explore people's perceptions about social AI vs. functional AI. Primary results suggest that individuals have more positive attitudes toward functional AI than social AI. Perceived usefulness of AI is found to have a mediation effect, suggesting functional AI, compared to social AI, leads to stronger perceived usefulness, which consequently fosters more positive attitudes and stronger perceived realism of AI.

While previous studies often focus on customer review or overlook the difference between the two types of reviews, we call attention to their distinct relational nature. We argue that the blinding policy has different impacts on the two types of reviews, and such differences are detectable in a review's linguistic features. We test this logic with mutual reviews (N = 191,526) between Airbnb guests and hosts in New York City during July 10th, 2013 to July 10th, 2015. Using interrupted timeseries analysis, we find that Airbnb's blinding policy on July 10th, 2014 made guest-to-host reviews more objective by reducing prosocial language and positive emotion. In contrast, blinding increased these features in host-to-guest reviews. We also found that this opposite impact of blinding on host-to-guest reviews was stronger when there were fewer opportunities for face-to-face interactions between hosts and guests. We theorize such opposing effects in terms of the ways that blinding alters, rather than eliminates, the relational nature of hosts’ behaviors toward guests. We argue for a broader appreciation of relational dynamics in the theoretical and practical understanding of online sharing-economy platforms. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Emotion; Mutual reviews; Prosocial language; Quasi-experiment; Reciprocity; Sharing economy"

While Apple has maintained strict control over its app store, Google has opted for a more lenient policy, until March 2022, when it would enforce its proprietary billing systems onto all paid and in-app purchases. This study examines the impact of Google's policy change on local Korean markets, especially the app store market, which features local app stores with a small but notable presence. By analyzing the responses of 18 managers, each of whom works for a different mobile content firm, this study examines specifically the probable strategies that mobile content firms can implement in response to Google's in-app purchase policy change. Based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model, this study finds that Korea's local mobile content firms are strongly inclined toward diverging away from Google's in-app purchase policy, but only if there will be sufficient governmental protection in tandem with cooperation from other industry firms. This study is one of the first to examine the responses to this policy change; thus, this research presents an array of meaningful implications to a timely and sensitive issue. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Analytic hierarchy process; App store ecosystem; Google play; In-app purchase policy change; Local app stores; Mobile content firms"

Thus, understanding the propagation of fake news and implementing countermeasures has become exceedingly important to the well-being of society. To assist this cause, we produce a valuable dataset called FibVID (Fake news information-broadcasting dataset of COVID-19), which addresses COVID-19 and non-COVID news from three key angles. First, we provide truth and falsehood (T/F) indicators of news items, as labeled and validated by several fact-checking platforms (e.g., Snopes and Politifact). Second, we collect spurious-claim-related tweets and retweets from Twitter, one of the world's largest social networks. Third, we provide basic user information, including the terms and characteristics of “heavy fake news” user to present a better understanding of T/F claims in consideration of COVID-19. FibVID provides several significant contributions. It helps to uncover propagation patterns of news items and themes related to identifying their authenticity. It further helps catalog and identify the traits of users who engage in fake news diffusion. We also provide suggestions for future applications of FibVID with a few exploratory analyses to examine the effectiveness of the approaches used. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Diffusion; Fact checking; Fake news"

The methodology follows a systematic search for the relevant resources, their classification and identification of six open data benchmarks to be further analyzed, the identification of their key components through decomposition, their description, and identifying the similarities and differences. Three major groups of indices and four periods that characterize the efforts to benchmark and measure the development of open data are identified, where the first measure the openness of the selected categories of data, the second focuses on different aspects of the open data ecosystem, using a large number of variables, and the third is a combination of both approaches. Recommendations as well as trends that can form the benchmarking frameworks in the future are also discussed. The findings are of a high importance for individual countries, which allow for correct and accurate interpretation of the results changes in the scope of a given index or rank, i.e., whether the difference in results is the result of national efforts or the subject of changes in the specific index, as well as how to combine and interpret the results of a number of indices for correct decision-making and for the definition of the future actions where the results vary significantly.

In China and many other nations, universities have introduced compulsory remote education programs such as mobile learning (m-learning) to prevent public health hazards caused by the pandemic. However, so far, there is still a lack of understanding of student's learning experience responses in compulsory m-learning programs. As such, there is a necessity to explore the factors and mechanisms which drives students’ experience. This paper evaluates the influence of both pedagogy and technology on learner's compulsory m-learning experience response (ER) by extending the mobile technology acceptance model (MTAM) during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data, which was then analysed through SmartPLS 3.2.9. Importance-performance matrix analysis was applied as a post-hoc procedure to gauge the importance and performance of the exogenous constructs. The results revealed that perceptions of m-learning's learning content quality, user interface, and system's connectivity affect the perceived mobile usefulness and easiness which in turn affects ER. This paper validates MTAM in the field of education by integrating MTAM with pedagogy and technology attributes under a social emergency setting such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the current research explains users' ER rather than behaviour intention which is commonly adopted in past studies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Mobile learning; Mobile technology acceptance model; Pedagogy; PLS-SEM"

This study advances the research on the factors of susceptibility to phishing in three regards. First, it addressed the role of organizational norms in susceptibility to phishing. Second, it aimed for high external and ecological validity by combining survey and phishing experiments data on large samples of organizations and their employees. Third, it employed a two-level design that considered explanatory variables at the individual and organizational levels. The study chiefly explored how formal, descriptive, injunctive, and personal norms influence employee interactions with phishing emails. To this end, an explanatory model was tested on 83,269 employees in 510 organizations using a multilevel modeling approach. Clicking on links in simulated phishing emails and entering personal information in simulated fraudulent websites were deemed as two types of susceptibility to phishing. Formal norms and collectively shared injunctive norms were found to exert the strongest effects on susceptibility to phishing; in contrast, personal norms exert a weak influence, and descriptive norms can result in a boomerang effect.

This study investigates the spatial dependence pattern of STTP outcomes and estimates the effects of the digital divide on such outcomes. The first car buyer policy (FCBP) in Thailand functioned as a real-world case study. We employ spatial econometric models using a dataset from Thailand in 2012. The results indicate the spatial distribution of STTP outcomes with positive spatial autocorrelation across Thai provinces. The spatial distribution tended to be high–high in the central and eastern regions and Phang Nga Province, whereas it was primarily low–low in the northeast region and Yala Province. The results also revealed significant spatial outliers (low–high) in the Ang Thong Province. Moreover, the results of the spatial econometric estimations show that STTP outcomes in Thailand could be influenced by the Internet access divides of neighboring provinces within Thailand. Additionally, this study revealed that urbanization, age, income per capita, and labor force participation had positive spatial associations with STTP outcomes. These findings provide insights that can assist policymakers in formulating more effective STTPs in developing countries. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Developing country; Digital divide; Policy bias; Short-term transportation policy; Spatial econometrics"

Studies on caste-based digital inequality are still scanty in India. Using nationally representative survey data, this paper analyzes the first-level digital divide (ownership of computer and access to the Internet) and the second-level digital divide (individuals skills to use computer and the Internet) between the disadvantaged caste groups and Others. Further, this paper identifies the caste-based differences in socioeconomic factors that contribute to the digital divide between these groups using a non-linear decomposition method. The results show that there exists large first-level and second-level digital divide between the disadvantaged caste groups and Others in India. The non-linear decomposition results indicate that caste-based digital divide in India is rooted in historical socioeconomic deprivation of disadvantaged caste groups.

The proposed model was tested using data collected from 717 users of m-commerce apps through an online survey. This study shows that relative advantage and perceived challenge positively influence customer perceptions of enjoyment and control, which leads to higher customer engagement behavior. Customers’ perceived enjoyment was also found to mediate the relationship between perceived relative advantage, perceived challenge, and three customer engagement dimensions (i.e., co-developing, influencing, and mobilizing behavior). By studying the factors that might be able to develop customers’ engagement behavior in m-commerce app settings, this research is a novel contribution to the literature, as previous studies in mobile apps focused more on adoption than user engagement behavior. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Challenge; Control; Customer engagement behavior; Enjoyment; Mobile commerce application; Relative advantage"

We conducted two experiments with 413 adults and found that people with macro-opinion congruence (i.e., societal majority) were more willing to speak out when perceiving supportive interactions from the majority of online commenters than no supportive interactions. Competence was a significant factor found to explain why people become emboldened to speak out under such conditions (i.e., macro-opinion congruence with majority online commenters’ supportive communication). However, counter to our original prediction, even if people perceive macro-opinion congruence, people with opinions incongruent with the majority online commenters are less willing to speak out when the minority online commenters (i.e., congruent with their own opinion) express supportive communication than no supportive communication. Although sense of community was found to be a significant mediating factor in explaining why people were more or less willing to speak out on social media in experiment 2, why supportive communication among minority online commenters diminished their willingness to speak out, rather than amplifying it, calls for further investigation. By incorporating factors like one's competence and sense of community, we identified the underlying mechanism of social empowerment while revisiting and expanding the spiral of silence theory in the context of social media interactions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Empowerment; Online comments; Social media; Spiral of silence; Supportive communication"

In this regard, the role of media as an information channel in delivering the reliable information and motivating the active participation of citizens in complying with government's preventive actions becomes much more important. In this study, the role of online news and social media on people's preventive actions considering the role of trust in citizens and government from the perspective of social capital is investigated. For the empirical study, a structural equation modeling is employed by using survey material gathered from South Korea in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. South Korea was selected as its COVID-19 prevention strategy focused not only on the provision of medical support, but also on the enhancement of social trust through active engagement with people through media channels. Our results reveal that the perceived characteristics of online news and social media influence preventive actions through the trust in citizens or in government. In addition, while online news media enhances trust in both the citizens and the government, social media only influences trust in citizens.

In this article, I use traditional statistical correlation and regression techniques along with newer natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to analyze the corpus of datasets hosted on government ODPs (total: 49,066) to extract patterns that relate scales of governance and political liberalism/conservatism to the priorities and meaning attached to environmental issues. I find that state-level and municipal-level ODPs host different categories of environmental datasets, with municipal-level ODPs generally hosting more datasets pertaining to services and amenities and state-level ODPs hosting more datasets pertaining to resource protection and extraction. Stronger trends were observed for the influences of political conservatism/liberalism among state-level ODPs than for municipal-level ODPs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental policy; Local and state government; Open data; Open government"

Despite its importance for society, it is unknown how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the Open Web. In this paper, we address this issue, focusing our analysis on Spain, one of the countries which have been most impacted by the pandemic. On the one hand, we study the impact of the pandemic in the financial backbone of the Open Web, the online advertising business. To this end, we leverage concepts from Supply–Demand economic theory to perform a careful analysis of the elasticity in the supply of ad-spaces to the financial shortage of the online advertising business and its subsequent reduction in ad spaces’ price. On the other hand, we analyze the distribution of the Open Web composition across business categories and its evolution during the COVID-19 pandemic. These analyses are conducted between Jan 1st and Dec 31st, 2020, using a reference dataset comprising information from more than 18 billion ad spaces. Our results indicate that the Open Web has experienced a moderate shift in its composition across business categories. However, this change is not produced by the financial shortage of the online advertising business, because as our analysis shows, the Open Web's supply of ad spaces is inelastic (i.e., insensitive) to the sustained low-price of ad spaces during the pandemic. Instead, existing evidence suggests that the reported shift in the Open Web composition is likely due to the change in the users’ online behavior (e.g., browsing and mobile apps utilization patterns). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Facebook; Online advertising; Open web; Price elasticity; Spain"

Based on the 10-year MFA efficiency level, content reselling was associated with high volatility, whereas content self-production was associated with an increasing trend in efficiency. Conversely, producers who both resell and produce content experienced little variability in their efficiency.

They can also be useful and effective in fighting the spread of infectious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though young adults are the most prevalent mHealth user group, the relevant literature has overlooked their intention to invest in and use mHealth services. This study aims to investigate the predictors that influence young adults’ intention to invest in mHealth (IINmH), particularly during the COVID-19 crisis, by designing a research methodology that incorporates both the health belief model (HBM) and the expectation-confirmation model (ECM). As an expansion of the integrated HBM-ECM model, this study proposes two additional predictors: mobile Internet speed and mobile Internet cost. A multi-method analytical approach, including partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM), fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), and machine learning (ML), was utilised together with a sample dataset of 558 respondents. The dataset—about young adults in Bangladesh with an experience of using mHealth—was obtained through a structured questionnaire to examine the complex causal relationships of the integrated model. The findings from PLS-SEM indicate that value-for-money, mobile Internet cost, health motivation, and confirmation of services all have a substantial impact on young adults’ IINmH during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, the fsQCA results indicate that a combination of predictors, instead of any individual predictor, had a significant impact on predicting IINmH. Among ML methods, the XGBoost classifier outperformed other classifiers in predicting the IINmH, which was then used to perform sensitivity analysis to determine the relevance of features. We expect this multi-method analytical approach to make a significant contribution to the mHealth domain as well as the broad information systems literature. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Integrated information systems model; mHealth; Multi-method analytical approach; SEM-fsQCA-ML; Young adults"

However, surprisingly few empirical studies have concentrated on the detrimental impact of social media adoption on young adults’ psychosocial well-being and mental health. Drawing upon previous stressor-strain-outcome theoretical paradigm (SSO), the present research investigates how psychosocial well-being assessments, especially compulsive WeChat use and information overload could trigger social media fatigue and, furthermore, how social media fatigue would ultimately result in emotional stress and social anxiety. This article utilized the cross-sectional design whereby statistical data were collected from 566 young people to test the conceptual research model.

The best-obtained model, together with explaining the spatial density of users, shows that there is high variability in the probability of detection of social media user protest supporters and that the collective posting rhythm and the day of observation are significant explanatory factors. The implication is that studies of collective spatial behavior would benefit by focussing on users’ activity centres and their urban environment, rather than their physical proximity to the protest location, the latter being unable to adequately explain spatial variations in users’ probability of detection and density during the protest event. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Posting rhythms; Protest event; Social media; Spatio–Temporal behavior; Urban environment"

Using data from real Bizum users and structural equation modelling, it was confirmed that: (1) customers’ attitudes and perceptions of control over the mobile app increased use and WOM intentions; (2) the subjective norm (i.e., social approval) is not important for the adoption of this P2P service; (3) the direct effect of perceived risk on behavioural intentions is not significant and that perceived risk is moderated by perceived security, such that its negative effects are significant when users perceive lower levels of security; (4) age and gender do not significantly influence adoption, which suggests that the service might be used by a wide spectrum.

The data was collected as part of a research project evaluating a program which aims to address digital disadvantages experienced by low-income households in the Shepparton area of regional Australia. The program provided a sample of students between the ages of 15 to 18 a laptop and their household's free access to unlimited broadband internet for up to two years. The digitally excluded are typically framed as lacking in abilities and access (Thomas et al., 2019), and as those for whom the costs of digital inclusion are too high to achieve (Ogle and Musolino, 2016; Ogle, 2017). Rarely, if ever, are those in low income households or those considered to be digitally marginalised imagined to also live in smart homes. Using experiences described in our data, we show how the uses of smart home technologies in these low-income households fit and contradict current understandings of both smart homes and digital inclusion; and contribute understandings of how those in low-income households experience automated technologies through the intersection of social and economic infrastructures. © 2021","Automated systems; Digital divide; Digital inclusion; Low-income; Smart home"

This study applied Uses and Gratifications Theory to investigate the utility of grandiose narcissism, vulnerable narcissism, primary psychopathy, secondary psychopathy, and Machiavellianism in predicting authentic self-presentation on Instagram. Participants (N = 542; 62.9% women; 60.1% Australian) with a currently active Instagram account were recruited via social media advertisements and completed an online questionnaire assessing personality and authenticity. Instagram authenticity was operationalised as Euclidean distances between the true self and the Instagram self. Results partially supported hypotheses, with higher levels of trait vulnerable narcissism and Machiavellianism predicting less congruence between the true self and the Instagram self (i.e., inauthenticity). Grandiose narcissism, primary psychopathy, and secondary psychopathy were not significant predictors of authentic self-presentation on Instagram. Findings of the current study extend previous research exploring authentic self-presentation on social media and are interpreted in line with uses and gratifications.

However, emerging evidence suggests disaffection toward e-health systems. There is an urgency to narrow down on factors that can improve intentions to use e-health apps/platforms that drive e-health systems to feed into the design and implementation of health management interventions. This paper contributes in this regard by exploring how resources of individuals' (value systems and information technology traits (i.e., microcomputer playfulness and IT innovativeness) and firms' (i.e., Corporate Social Responsibility [CSR]) influence e-health apps/platforms usage intentions. Using dispositional traits and human values theories, we tested the research hypotheses with data (N = 604) from users and prospective users of e-health platforms/apps in Ghana. The results supported a positive relationship between openness to change values and e-health usage intentions, and partial mediation effects of IT-specific traits in this relation. Additionally, the results supported moderated-mediation of CSR on the link between openness to change values, IT innovativeness, and e-health usage intentions but that of microcomputer playfulness was not supported.

Each of three analyses shows that people have distinctive heuristic structures that are “hardwired” for quick judgements as they filter, interpret, and retain cues in their release of personal data. Analysis 1 examines a non-linear pattern of behavioral responses to varying intensity of concern. Analysis 2 investigates indirect relationships between concern and data surrender. Analysis 3 examines temporal incongruence as one's protective action can be delayed over time. Findings across three analyses corroborate the insight that readily-accessible cognitive judgements help reduce the difficulty of estimating the likelihood of privacy gain and loss into a set of simple principles. This study concludes by cautiously warning the digital entrenchment of surveillance in that when a data consideration is reduced to a quick moment of choice, privacy can be over-released, surrendered over gratification, and eventually deferred to inaction. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Data privacy; Personal information; Privacy concern; Surveillance"

Although Pakistan's government developed the Electronic Government Directorate (EGD) in 2005, the country's adoption rate of e-government services is extremely low. This research aimed to expand the decomposed theory of planned behavior (DTPB), which is based on the Unified Model of electronic government adoption (UMEGA), to more comprehensively understand the determinants of e-government adoption behaviour among 396 citizens in Pakistan. The extension is implemented by adding the impact of relational bonds (economic, social and structural) on trust. The findings show that the following four factors have a significant effect on citizens intention to adopt e-government services: (a) attitude, (b) subjective norm, (c) perceived behaviour control (d) trust. These four factors are predicted by effort expectancy and performance expectancy, mass media influence and family influence, self-efficacy, economic, structural and social bonds, respectively. Furthermore, this research validates the applicability of the DTPB model and demonstrates that the extended DTPB model, which is based on the UMEGA model, has excellent predictive power in understanding citizens intention to adopt e-government services. Based on these findings, implications for policymakers and recommendations for further future research are offered. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","E-government; Relational bonds; Trust; UMEGA model"

When individuals perceive corporate surveillance, it could contribute to their self-censorship practices, such as using less media or using media differently. This study aims to understand why people decide to self-regulate their media use, which is important from the perspective of control that individuals have over data collection. Therefore, we studied what would motivate individuals to change their media-related behavior in response to perceived corporate surveillance, focusing on cross-country and generational differences. This study employed a combination of a thought-listing exercise conducted in the Netherlands (N = 300) and a cross-sectional survey in the United States (N = 148) and the Netherlands (N = 156) in which respondents were presented with a scenario regarding corporate surveillance and asked about their motivations (not) to change their media use. The studies showed that privacy was a more important motivation for the intent to change media use in the United States, while in the Netherlands people were less motivated to change due to seeing less potential harm of corporate surveillance. The results could be explained by cultural differences or differences in legal protection. Finally, older people saw less threats and were less able to protect themselves, while younger individuals were not motivated to make changes to their media use because of mobile device dependency. This indicates that while more is needed to help people make informed decisions, empowerment measures should be adjusted to different generations and locations. © 2022 The Authors","Chilling effects; Perceived surveillance; Privacy; Privacy protection; Self-censorship; Self-regulation"

Using a one-and-one-half bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation method, a survey was conducted on 525 respondents in Korea, and the spike model was applied to distinguish zero willingness-to-pay (WTP). The results show that a household's WTP for the public fact-checking system is 10,652 KRW (9 USD), on average, in the form of income tax for five years. Given the amount is a regular payment in perpetuity, the total WTP is estimated at 23 billion KRW ($196 M) every year. The result also shows that an individual's WTP increases as his or her psychological damage caused by fake news is high, as well as his or her high reliance on news in a disaster situation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Contingent valuation; Fake news; Fake news policy; National disaster situation; National hazard; Technological response in public"

This data can be analyzed to provide a deep insight into the effect of the game on its players. However, traditional techniques to assess players of serious games make little use of interaction data, relying instead on costly external questionnaires. We propose an evidence-based process to improve the assessment of players by using their interaction data. The process first combines player interaction data and traditional questionnaires to derive and refine game learning analytics variables, which can then be used to predict the effects of the game on its players. Once the game is validated, and suitable prediction models have been built, the prediction models can be used in large-scale deployments to assess players solely based on their interactions, without the need for external questionnaires. We briefly describe two case studies where this combination of traditional questionnaires and data mining techniques has been successfully applied.

As more towns, cities, and regions turn to lockdown, government social media accounts (GSMAs) develop as a trustworthy source to obtain information about the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, investigating the determinants and consequences of citizens' participation behavior on GSMAs is essential. Drawing on the self-determination theory (SDT) and civic volunteer model (CVM), we examine the influence of motivational factors (i.e., intrinsic extrinsic) on citizens' participation behavior on GSMAs, which leads to online civic behavior. Comparative research between China and Pakistan is carried out using data collected through an online survey. This study shows that information-seeking, political benefits, self-development, altruism, and perceived reciprocity are the critical antecedents of citizens' participatory behavior on GSMAs in both countries, resulting in online civic behavior. Furthermore, moderating results reveal that perceived connectivity moderates the relationship between certain motivational factors (intrinsic and extrinsic) and citizens' participatory behavior on GSMAs, whereas trust in government moderates the relationship between participatory behavior on GSMAs and online civic behavior during COVID-19.

Our focus is on Canada, and the apparent need for further intra-rural broadband research and better data and mapping for informing public investment decisions, but similar challenges are evident in the international literature. Based on proprietary telecommunication provider datasets, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunication Commission (CRTC) estimates that broadband services with advertised speeds that meet its basic universal service targets (50 Mbps download and 10 Mbps upload) are available to 87.4 percent of households in Canada. In rural areas however, services that meet CRTC's speed targets are available to 45.6 percent of households. Moreover, effective speeds and service quality levels that suppliers deliver and users experience tend to fall well below the government's aspirational targets. In response to demand for better broadband, a variety of initiatives are directing public investment to the deployment of regional and rural broadband networks, which are typically owned and operated by private companies. There remains a serious lack of relevant data and its effective use in creating rural broadband strategies and managing public investment projects. Evidence from the literature suggest that this affects the degree and quality of geo-spatial and econometric analysis that results in a limited empirical basis to allocate scarce public investments, aggregate demand of consumers/communities, and assess the outcomes of rural broadband initiatives ex post. This paper provides a historical overview of rural broadband development in Canada and questions if the body of knowledge to inform public investment initiatives has grown sufficiently to ensure their effectiveness and sustainability. With a regional case from southwestern Ontario, Canada, we discuss the findings of the literature review, characterize the broadband data challenge, and discuss the importance of proprietary provider data cross-referenced with Internet user experience data. © 2021","Broadband; Canada; Data; Internet; Investment; Ontario; Regional; Rural"

However, most previous studies of intermittent discontinuance ignored the elderly group. Meanwhile, the prior studies rarely explored the inhibitors and disclosed the whole cognitive and emotion forming phase of intermittent discontinuance. To fill these gaps, the present study targets the elderly group and develops a dual mechanism model from both “enabling-inhibiting” and “appraisal-emotional reaction-coping response” perspectives. The empirical study based on the survey of 307 Chinese elderly MSNS users demonstrates that, in enabling mechanism, excluding the social overload, information and system feature overload can increase the elderly users’ fatigue, which will further trigger intermittent discontinuance. In inhibiting mechanism, excepting the autonomy need satisfaction, relatedness and competence need satisfaction from the MSNS have positive association with the elderly users’ emotional attachment towards MSNS, which will further decrease the intermittent discontinuance. The findings imply that, for the coexistence of enabling and inhibiting mechanism, the service providers should not only decrease the overload-fatigue based enablers but also increase the need satisfaction-attachment based inhibitors to control the intermittent discontinuance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Elderly MSNS users; Enabling mechanism; Inhibiting mechanism; Intermittent discontinuance; Self-regulation"

Because, it is the primary motive for people to accept new technology, it is crucial to repair trust when damaged. This study investigated how intelligent agents should apologize to recover trust and how the effectiveness of the apology is different when the agent is human-like compared to machine-like based on two seemingly competing frameworks of the Computers-Are-Social-Actors paradigm and automation bias. A 2 (agent: Human-like vs. Machine-like) X 2 (apology attribution: Internal vs. External) between-subject design experiment was conducted (N = 193) in the context of the stock market. Participants were presented with a scenario to make investment choices based on an artificial intelligence agent's advice. To see the trajectory of the initial trust-building, trust violation, and trust repair process, we designed an investment game that consists of five rounds of eight investment choices (40 investment choices in total). The results show that trust was repaired more efficiently when a human-like agent apologizes with internal rather than external attribution. However, the opposite pattern was observed among participants who had machine-like agents; the external rather than internal attribution condition showed better trust repair. Both theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropomorphism; Apology attribution; Artificial intelligence; Automation bias; CASA paradigm; Trust repair"

In this sense, students are motivated to learn by actively engaging in educational experiences performed in renewed stages with trendy resources and praxis, where they are involved in hands–on activities similar to true work. Hence, traditional academic facilities, curricula, content, materials, and practices should be transformed according to the needs and trends of an evolving world society that requires the use of smart and advanced technologies that empower teaching and learning duties. With the aim of contributing to cope with such a demand, a learning design cooperative framework is proposed to harness suitable technologies that upgrade classic academic sceneries and toils to recreate 21st century education settings. Thus, the framework is tested during a real case, where it leads the conversion of a typical engineering lab to a ubiquitous engineering lab that enables undergraduates to access digital content and cooperate with peers to automatize equipment proper to an industrial cell. Albeit experimental pupils were not trained to adapt to a novel situation and dealt with higher cognitive load, they reached a more superior and balanced learning than their control mates.

Hence, this study aims to compare the metrics and methodologies used to measure, benchmark, and rank governments' progress in open government data initiatives. Using a critical meta-analysis approach, we compare nine benchmarks with reference to meta-data, meta-methods, and meta-theories. This study finds that both existing open government data benchmarks and academic open data progress models use a great variety of metrics and methodologies, although open data impact is not usually measured. While several benchmarks’ methods have changed over time, and variables measured have been adjusted, we did not identify a similar pattern for academic open data progress models. This study contributes to open data research in three ways: 1) it reveals the strengths and weaknesses of existing open government data benchmarks and academic open data progress models; 2) it reveals that the selected open data benchmarks employ relatively similar measures as the theoretical open data progress models; and 3) it provides an updated overview of the different approaches used to measure open government data initiatives’ progress. Finally, this study offers two practical contributions: 1) it provides the basis for combining the strengths of benchmarks to create more comprehensive approaches for measuring governments’ progress in open data initiatives; and 2) it explains why particular countries are ranked in a certain way.

Could this mechanism have consequences for users’ self-esteem and happiness? Previous findings on the topic are mixed, and typically limited by use of self-reports of online activity. In the present study, we used objective behavioral data to examine the hypotheses that receiving Likes on Facebook would relate to 1) users’ level of perceived self-esteem, and 2) increased happiness via the mediating role of self-esteem. We recruited 2,349 adult Facebook users (589 men, 1,760 women; 67% aged 18–25, 26% aged 26–35, 7% aged > 35 years). Participants answered an online survey and provided access to their objective Facebook data (i.e., profile updates and received Likes). We found that frequency of users updating their profile and sharing personal content (e.g., self-generated texts, images, friends and location tags) had a direct effect on the frequency and intensity of the feedback (i.e., Likes) they received from other users in their online social network. Additionally, analyses supported a positive link between the frequency and intensity of positive feedback received by users and perceived happiness that was mediated in part by an increase in self-esteem.

This research examined the use of VR in tourism through the lenses of an extended TAM model in times of COVID-19 pandemic. The premise was that, in this context, people would prefer less risky experiences and would see VR as a substitute for traditional travel. The data used was collected through a within-subjects experiment, which proved that intention to use VR in tourism increased under the COVID-19 effect. This study tested a conceptual model that showed this intention was influenced by the perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and perceived substitutability of VR, all mediated by people's interest in VR use in tourism. The perceived authenticity of VR experience determined the perceived substitutability of VR. This paper has theoretical and practical implications.

The primary objectives of this current article are to investigate the possible influences of perceived values (hedonic and utilitarian) on WeChat users’ affective responses (attitude and satisfaction) and electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) engagement. This study represents one of the few that utilized customer-perceived value theory and uses and gratifications theory to establish a conceptual framework to determine consumers’ word-of-mouth behaviors in the WeChat setting. Based on a web-based survey of 408 WeChat users, structure equation modeling was implemented to identify and confirm the hypothesized research model. Overall, the results reveal that hedonic value and utilitarian value positively and significantly impact WeChat users’ attitudes and anticipated satisfaction. Additionally, satisfaction has a significant influence on eWOM engagement. Furthermore, utilitarian value is discovered to exert a significant indirect effect through satisfaction on eWOM engagement. The obtained outcomes offer fresh insight into whether and how mobile social media could promote mobile social media users’ attitudes and gratification which subsequently would facilitate indicators of eWOM engagement in contemporary mobile-mediated context. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Attitude; Electronic word-of-mouth engagement; Perceived values; Satisfaction; WeChat"

Recent studies have been critical of the “bias toward the supply side” and lack of “sufficient attention to the user perspective” in the way that open government data initiatives are implemented. This article asks: (1) who is using municipal open government data resources and for what purposes? and (2) what impact are municipal open government data having in cities where they have been implemented? We performed a qualitative analysis of 26 semi-structured telephone interviews conducted with government staff, civic technologists, and private sector stakeholders in nine cities around the United States. Each of these 30 to 45-minute telephone interviews were transcribed and analyzed to distill insights regarding the use and impact of municipal open government data in the nine cities considered. We find that the array of actors within open government data ecosystems at the local level is expanding as distinctions between the public and private sectors becomes increasingly blurred and that the demands of managing and sustaining these initiatives has led to changes in the services offered by local government, as well as in the duties of government staff. The impact of these data resources has been primarily felt within local government itself, although the lack of monitoring mechanisms makes it difficult to systematically evaluate their broader effects. We conclude that open government data initiatives should be coordinated and better integrated with digital equity and digital inclusion efforts in order to advance their political and social goals. © 2020 The Author(s)","Civic technology; Digital equity; Local government; Open data"

To resolve this debate, this study focuses on multiplayer social network games (MSNGs), the affordances of which may lead to the coexistence of augmentation and displacement effects. To unpack the conditions under which gameplay has a positive or negative relationship with psychological well-being, this study distinguishes between co-player interaction modes (in-game social interactions vs. social media interactions) and between co-players’ identity types (offline friends/acquaintances vs. guild members). An online survey was conducted with 300 gamers in China. The results revealed that more in-game interaction with co-players was positively associated with players’ loneliness, whereas more social media interaction with co-players was negatively related to players’ loneliness, regardless of the co-players’ identities. However, players who played with offline friends/acquaintances did engage in more social interactions than those who played with guild members, especially social media interactions. Moreover, the effect of playing with friends/acquaintances or guild members on players’ loneliness was fully mediated by in-game social interactions and social media interactions. That is, the psychosocial influence of gameplay heavily depends on the exact social interactions that players are involved in rather than on general time spent in games, and the augmentation and displacement effects possibly coincide within one game. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Augmentation and displacement effects; Co-player; Loneliness; Multiplayer social network games; Social interactions"

While prior research has recognized what convinces users to choose the games, what has been lacking is considering unique characteristics of video games allowing consumers to experience video games permanently until satiation. Thus, this study examines: (1) How does user play time influence next purchase timing after expressing opinions via the review systems? and (2) How does the relationship between play patterns and re-purchase timing patterns change by game genres? To answer these research questions, we collected data from Valve Corporation's Steam. Using an R program to crawl the data, we gathered 244,360 reviews from 6,170 games between February 2018 and March 2018. With Cox proportional-hazards models, we found that user play patterns were dependening on their satisfaction with the games. We also found that if a user stops playing, even after recommending a game, they are less likely to buy a new game. Additionally, frustrated players turn to variety-seeking behavior, thus spending time playing other games, and are more likely to buy new games. In the sub-group analysis, we also found that users who recently played a Casual game have the highest probability of buying a new game. Video games are an interesting experience goods due to their unique characteristics; consumers can keep consuming products until they are satiated. However, to our best knowledge, there is a lack of study about satiation's effect on game consumption. Many researches on video games have examined various topics with many research methodologies, such as descriptive statistics, experiments, survey, observational studies, or network analyses. However, unlike previous studies, we directly collected user play pattern and purchase data from Valve and examined how the behavior of purchasing a new game is related to user play pattern after the recommendation. This is a novel methodology of using data crawling and econometrics modeling to investigate game users’ purchase behavioral patterns with the observational data. So, we believe that our study can benefit marketing managers and game developers, providing critical information regarding target markets and play patterns of potential consumers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Game platform; Online recommendation; Play time; Purchase decision; Satiation effect; Steam"

The emergence of insertable devices has changed this. Since this technology is still in its initial development stages, few studies have investigated factors that influence its acceptance. This paper analyzes the predictors of the intention to use non-medical insertable devices in two Latin American contexts. We used partial least squares structural equation modeling to examine whether six constructs predicted intention to use insertable devices. A questionnaire was administered to undergraduate students located in Colombia and Chile (n = 672). We also examined whether these predictors influenced intention differently for both of them. Four common constructs significantly and positively influenced both Chilean and Colombian respondents to use insertable devices (hedonic motivation, habit, performance expectancy, and social influence). Also, the habit has a complementary mediating effect on the relationship between social influence and behavioral intention. By contrast, effort expectations were a positive and significant predictor, but only among Chilean respondents. Findings suggest that when technologies are emerging, well-known predictors of intention (e.g., performance and effort expectations) are less influential than predictors related to self-efficacy (e.g., habit and hedonic motivation). The use of insertable devices has a significant impact on society. Thus, a better understanding of what motivates their use has implications for both academia and industry. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Behavioral intention; Digital device usage; Insertable digital devices; Technology acceptance; UTAUT2"

However, the main unanswered questions about this foreseen transformation are its depth, breadth and timelines. To answer them, not only do we lack the tools to determine what achievements will be attained in the near future, but we even ignore what various technologies in present-day AI are capable of. Many so-called breakthroughs in AI are associated with highly-cited research papers or good performance in some particular benchmarks. However, research breakthroughs do not directly translate into a technology that is ready to use in real-world environments. In this paper, we present a novel exemplar-based methodology to categorise and assess several AI technologies, by mapping them onto Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) (representing their depth in maturity and availability). We first interpret the nine TRLs in the context of AI, and identify several categories in AI to which they can be assigned. We then introduce a generality dimension, which represents increasing layers of breadth of the technology. These two dimensions lead to the new readiness-vs-generality charts, which show that higher TRLs are achievable for low-generality technologies, focusing on narrow or specific abilities, while high TRLs are still out of reach for more general capabilities. We include numerous examples of AI technologies in a variety of fields, and show their readiness-vs-generality charts, serving as exemplars. Finally, we show how the timelines of several AI technology exemplars at different generality layers can help forecast some short-term and mid-term trends for AI. © 2020 The Author(s)","AI technologies; Capabilities; Generality; Technology readiness; TRLs"

Urban authorities have gradually been won over by the these activits’ promises to encourage entrepreneurship, generate new knowledge, mobilize citizens and even transform the perceptions of and the way in which manufacturing is conducted in the city. However, these activists’ attractive discourse overly mechanically equates the accessibility of these digital tools to the idea of empowerment. Under what conditions can these practices of making lead to an increase in citizens’ individual and collective power to act, or even to social change?

In contrast, Internet security in surrounding countries yields negative spatial location spillovers that hinder Chinese firms from investing in the host country. This phenomenon can be regarded as a national competition for Internet security to attract FDI. Mechanism tests show that Internet security promotes FDI in host countries through four channels: operating cost reductions, transaction cost-cutting, information asymmetry decreases, and confidentiality protection. Further heterogeneous analyses show that the impact of Internet security is more significant as time passes and the host country becomes an Internet society. In contrast, specific international cooperation frameworks led by China weaken the location effect of Internet security for Chinese outward FDI. These results are robust after controlling for potential endogeneity and to different specifications. Therefore, the host authorities should endeavor to create a high-quality Internet security environment to attract FDI. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Foreign direct investment; Internet security; Location choice; Spatial econometrics; Spillovers"

However, little is understood about the actual use of open data, particularly how open data portal users engage with open datasets. This study analyzes the actual use of open data with a focus on a specific type of use, namely engagement. It is based on a cross-sectional analysis of web analytic behavioral data, from New York State's open health data portal, that quantifies users’ engagement with open datasets. Results of an exploratory factor analysis confirm the presence of distinct levels of users’ engagement with open datasets. In addition, a PLS-SEM analysis reveals significant positive relationships between lower and higher levels of engagement, suggesting users’ engagement with open datasets occurs along a continuum, with lower levels of engagement influencing higher levels. Theoretically, this study contributes a new sub-construct (“Engagement”) to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) theoretical framework to facilitate a more nuanced understanding of actual open data use. Practically, this study contributes novel empirical evidence for users’ engagement with open datasets as well as reliable engagement measures. Insights from this study can inform improvements to open data strategies and portals to facilitate wider engagement with these valuable resources. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Health data; Information management; Open government data; Technology use; User engagement"

To provide insights into the gaps in previous research, the authors identify the channels, and hypothesize that negative evaluation and rejection fears mediate the relationship between social interaction anxiety and compulsive social media usage. Further, the moderating role of frustration about unavailability and gender differences are considered in the framework for robustness purposes. Using a convenience sampling method and variance-based structural equation modeling, the authors analyzed a non-clinical sample of 402 Chinese university students. Survey results find that social interaction anxiety increases compulsive social media usage both directly and indirectly through fear of negative evaluation and fear of rejection with a stronger effect of the former. Moreover, the mediating effect of fear of negative evaluation transfers through fear of rejection, which establishes a serial link between social interaction anxiety and compulsive social media usage. Interestingly, frustration about unavailability strengthens the relationship only between fear of rejection and compulsive social media usage. Females exhibit more social interaction anxiety and fear of negative evaluation, which lead them to become more compulsive social media users, while males experience more fear of rejection. These findings can improve our understanding of the role and process by which social interaction anxiety influences compulsive social media usage, and thus may help psychologists to develop better counseling programs for compulsive male and female social media users, addressing their social interaction deficits and excessive reliance on social media applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Compulsive social media usage; Frustration about unavailability; Internet; Social anxiety; Social interaction deficits; Social media"

Although the support provided through curricula in schools develops these skills to a certain extent, digital divide still exists for individuals with different socio-demographic characteristics. The concept of digital divide, used to define individuals who do not have equal access to digital technologies, has started to be seen as a determining factor for digital competencies with its expanding scope. The current study aims to take a perspective to investigate the effect of socio-demographic variables, which may cause digital divide, on students' ICT literacy. With this study, it is sought to explain the effect of current inequalities regarding digital access on students' ICT skills. To this end, the socio-demographic characteristics of the students in the sample of Korea and Chile from the participating countries of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) were examined in the context of ICT literacy. The characteristics of the models created were compared for both countries. While parents’ level of education variable stands out for the Chilean model, the internet connection variable is remarkable for the Korean model. It is anticipated that the findings of the research will contribute to understanding the dynamics of the digital divide and its possible consequences, and can be a source for preventive policy steps to be developed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chile; Computer and information literacy; Digital divide; ICILS; Korea"

In this study, we explored the influence of this cognitive factor on cyber-bystanders’ helping tendencies as well as elucidated possible underlying processes. The results of two studies were reported. In Study 1, 150 undergraduates read a true case of a girl experiencing cyberbullying. The results indicated that when the participants perceived the victim's situation to be more critical (i.e., higher emergency perception), their helping tendencies were stronger, partly through increased state empathy followed by feelings of responsibility to help. In Study 2, we randomly assigned 300 undergraduates to two groups. The low emergency group read the same cyberbullying case as Study 1, whereas the cyberbullying case read by the high emergency group contained additional emergency information of the victim. The results indicated that the high emergency group expressed stronger helping tendencies than did the low emergency group. This effect was caused by a stronger perception that the victim was in an emergency situation, which not only strengthened the participants’ helping tendencies directly but also indirectly through increasing their state empathy and feelings of responsibility to help. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cyberbullying; Emergency perception; Feelings of responsibility to help; Helping behaviour; State empathy"

The open connectivity brings with it great convenience and leads to a variety of risks that cannot be overlooked. Smartphone vendors, security policy designers, and security application providers have put a variety of practical efforts to secure smartphones, and researchers have conducted extensive research on threat sources, security techniques, and user security behaviors. Regrettably, smartphone users do not pay enough attention to mobile security, making many efforts futile. This study identifies this gap between technology affordance and user requirements, and attempts to investigate the asymmetric perceptions toward security features between developers and users, between users and users, as well as between different security features. These asymmetric perceptions include perceptions of quality, perceptions of importance, and perceptions of satisfaction. After scoping the range of smartphone security features, this study conducts an improved Kano-based method and exhaustively analyzes the 245 collected samples using correspondence analysis and importance satisfaction analysis. The 14 security features of the smartphone are divided into four Kano quality types and the perceived quality differences between developers and users are compared. Correspondence analysis is utilized to capture the relationship between the perceived importance of security features across different groups of respondents, and results of importance-satisfaction analysis provide the basis for the developmental path and resource reallocation strategy of security features.

An experiment with 496 children (9–13 years old) shows that privacy literacy negatively influences disclosure behavior. However, there is an interaction effect between privacy literacy and reward on perceived fairness, eventually affecting disclosure behavior. More specifically, children who are more literate find data practices to be fairer when a reward is provided, which in turn leads to greater data disclosure.

However, in order for open government data to be fully taken advantage of, it must be found, understood, and used. Though many countries maintain open government data portals, the usability of said portals can vary greatly; this is important to understand as the usability of a portal likely impacts the eventual reuse of the data made available there. Acknowledging the importance of portal usability to the data reuse process, this paper helps to elucidate some initial insights by asking two questions: “How can the usability of open government data portals be evaluated and compared across contexts?” and “What are the most commonly missing usability aspects from open government data portals?”. In order to answer these research questions, a subset of 41 national open government data portals were selected for an in-depth usability analysis drawing on the feedback from 40 individual users. As a result of this analysis, the paper is able to make three primary contributions: (1) the validation of a framework for open government data portal usability analysis, (2) develops an initial comparative international ranking of open government data portal usability, and (3) identifies commonly occurring portal usability strengths and weaknesses across contexts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Open data; Open data portal; Open government data; Usability"

Many organizations have applied opportunity-reducing techniques to enhance security. These techniques have been classified into hard and soft forms based on their potential propensity to infringe on employees’ personal space. Hard form techniques have been widely adopted owing to their efficiency in saving cost and time. However, this study argues that hard form techniques would restrict personal autonomy, leading employees to disrespect the organizational security policies. To test the research hypotheses, a scenario-based questionnaire survey was conducted on 5,158 Prolific Academic members with working experience in the service industry and research and development, and the information industry. Two hundred and fifty-nine valid responses were analyzed using partial least square based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results show that the hard form techniques induce employees to feel intrusion of their privacy, making them morally irresponsible for their behavior, and even committing an insider attack. Hard form techniques can produce an adverse effect that is opposite to the intended purpose. The results imply that the practical method of making hard controls less intrusive, including the implementation of soft controls and horizontal decision-making processes for security policies, should be explored. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Insider threats; Moral disengagement; Opportunity-reducing techniques; Privacy-security tradeoff; Situational crime prevention theory; Social contract theory"

Real estate online platforms (REOPs) are getting more attention in the era of COVID-19, where the real estate businesses must run online, and the service users are pushed to a forced digital experience adoption. The users or consumers are not satisfied or happy with the current state of REOPs and often regret their decisions due to the poor quality of the web-based information provided on these REOPs. Based on a mixed approach of integrated KANO-SISQual, the current study develops a comprehensive smart real estate technology adoption model (SRETAM) to model the users’ perception of the REOPs in DDE. Data is collected through a questionnaire survey from 407 Sydney based REOP users. A total of 31 key factors are identified by reviewing 256 articles vetted by 12 local real estate agents. The results highlight 19 factors to be very important to REOPs users: reliability, the accuracy of the information, and credibility of the online platforms are the top three important factors. The hypotheses’ results show that all the SRETAM categories contribute equally to the users’ behavioural intention to use the REOPs and the KANO categories are statistically different. For KANO categories, eight attractive features are identified: graphical statistics, familiar web technology, content structure, web design, immersive content, self-efficacy, information novelty, and presence of 3D interactive models. Displaying the users’ location, learning tutorials, and hyperlinks to external sources on the web portals dissatisfy REOP users. The factors and their classifications can help the users get more features, verified, and transparent information for making better decisions in the DDE, whereas the REOP can enjoy more business due to increased service consumers. This can lay the foundation for transforming the traditional real estate sector into smart real estate in lines with industry 4.0 requirements in the DDE. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","KANO Model; Real estate management; Real estate online platforms; SISQual approach; Smart real estate; Technology acceptance model; Users’ perception"

Primary data were collected during September and October 2019 through face-to-face structured interviews, yielding 762 valid responses. By utilising the standard neoclassical utility maximization framework and binary logistic regressions, the results show that family income is a relevant predictor for the diffusion of DTT and cable-based pay TV, but not for the satellite-based. Instead, educational attainment plays an important role in explaining the adoption of satellite-based pay TV. Being an online video consumer is the only factor associated with the three services. Furthermore, this study reveals that awareness of DTT can stimulate its adoption. Meanwhile, the insignificant of television media use variables in the three models can be attributed to the absence of the relevant contents broadcasted on the television, indicating underutilisation of the television to communicate information about new innovation. These varied findings may indicate that each television service is in a diffusion phase that is different from one another.

However, little is known about what motivates people to use them or how these motivations influence users’ post-consumption evaluations and perceptions. This study develops measures to capture uses and gratifications related to voice AI assistants. It identifies five primary motivations for use—social interaction, personal identity, conformity, life efficiency, and information. Results show that the utilitarian motivations of life efficiency and information influence all post-consumption evaluations and behavioral intentions positively (i.e., users’ attitudes, satisfaction, and intentions to continue using voice AI assistants). However, social motivations are also important. Social interaction and conformity motivations also influence user satisfaction, and the conformity motivation shapes individuals’ intentions to continue using voice AI assistants. The findings further demonstrate that users’ motivations influence perceptions of their voice AI assistants’ roles. In keeping with the “Computers Are Social Actors” (CASA) paradigm, users motivated by social interaction are likely to perceive a voice AI assistant as socially attractive and as a friend, whereas users motivated by life efficiency are likely to perceive it as an assistant. Users motivated by information are more likely to perceive a voice AI assistant as technology, while those motivated by social interaction are less likely to do so.

This study conducted an experimental design to explore the roles of trust in different stages and three key online rating characteristics, including overall numerical ratings (high or general), review volume (high or low), and a comparison of the effect rating and attitude rating (higher or lower effect rating than attitude rating), in influencing health consumers’ choices. Results suggested that the overall numerical rating and review volume were significantly and positively correlated with the physician selection intention. Perceived physician trustworthiness completely mediated the effect of the review volume on consumer intentions, while initial trust in online physician ratings produced a moderating effect. The comparison of sub-dimension rating scores induces consumers’ regulatory focus and further moderated the relationship between overall rating score and consumers’ selection intentions, as well as the relationship between perceived physician trustworthiness and consumers’ selection intentions.

This research examines how users define the central qualities of four major platforms in the United States (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat), and how such lay definitions relate to key outcomes previously associated with social media use. In Study 1, we validated self-report measures using a comparative scaling approach to capture what users view as the most defining categories of the four platforms. In Study 2, we investigated whether lay definitions of platforms relate to perceptions of social affordances and social resources. Overall, results provided evidence that defining platforms as social interaction (vs. other qualities) is associated with amplified social affordances and resources. Together, the studies contribute to our understanding of how users navigate a dynamic online ecosystem, as well as how lay definitions may anchor the experiences and effects of social media. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Comparative scaling; Lay definitions; Platform essence; Platforms; Social affordances; Social capital; Social media; Social support"

This study used ideas from Social Cognition Theory, Health Belief Model and Theory of Planned Behaviour to examine how social media communications impact blood donation attitudes and behavioural intention through some socio-psychological outcomes among young adult Millennials at a university in South-Africa. Quantitative data was collected from 650 respondents. Structural equation modelling results revealed that social media communications positively impacted awareness, perception, peers, family, and behavioural intention. Motivation, awareness, peers and family positively influenced attitudes, which in turn, predicted blood donation intention.

A challenge with AV research is that the technology is not yet readily available for consumers to experience. Thus, public perceptions of AVs are often assessed through survey research which has uncovered demographic and socio-economic differences in the willingness to adopt and pay for AVs. It has also provided information about the perceived benefits and risks associated with AVs and how these perceived benefits and risks affects support for self-driving car technology. More recently, studies have found that political ideology is linked to perceived concerns about self-driving cars but have not yet assessed whether this link extends to the intent to adopt AVs. Given this gap in our knowledge, the contributions of the present paper our twofold. One, we will assess whether political ideology impacts the intention to adopt AVs. Two, we will assess whether political ideology directly or indirectly affects the intention to adopt AVs. As regards the latter, we will conduct a mediation analysis with a path model to assess the extent that political ideology indirectly affects the intention to adopt via the perceived benefits and concerns survey respondents expressed about AVs. Our results reveal political ideology is an important predictor of individuals’ intent to adopt AVs, as characterized by both willingness to ride in and to own AVs. Specifically, compared to conservative participants, moderates and liberals reported higher AV adoption intentions. We also find that the effect of political ideology on AV adoption intention is mediated by participants’ perceived benefits and concerns about AVs. Compared to conservatives, political moderates reported AV adoption intention via higher perceived benefits about AVs. Compared to conservatives, liberals reported higher AV adoption intention through both higher perceived benefits and lower perceived concerns about AVs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",""

The result is managers being frustrated at not achieving their desired results. Despite an increase in social media research, it is evident that some critical aspects of social media use by organisations are left unexplained by existing theories. The purpose of this research study is to investigate how social media is used within organisations to engage with its online community. The grounded theory method (GTM) was used to develop a substantive theory that increases understanding of this phenomenon. Two organisations were selected as the case studies. Both are industry leaders in South Africa, with one being a prominent retailer with a visible social media presence and the other, being a leading university in South Africa, which is actively growing its social media presence. The results show that organisations enter a collective storytelling process with their online community. The need to reduce risk to reputation and improve on the levels of online community engagement are identified as reasons for this. The strategic alignment of the social media function and the organisational social media use characteristics set the backdrop for the collective storytelling process, while content quality influences the richness of this process. Challenges associated with the collective storytelling process lead to the development and refinement of the organisational social media strategy, which in turn helps to reduce risk to reputation and improve online community engagement. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Co-creation; Organisation-Community engagement; Social media strategy"

We extend the cultural context to the Global South countries, where there is less research on “mobile first” societies centred on emerging mobile platforms. Based on extensive and mixed-methods fieldwork in rural and industrial China about everyday information seeking practices, the paper goes beyond previous research about digital divides in internet access and internet literacy. Instead, it focuses on divides in everyday information seeking practices. We argue that new divides are emerging between those with more restricted everyday internet uses and those with broader and more diverse ones. We compare everyday information practices and divides in China with those in India and show how a theory of digital divides in everyday information seeking practices can be applied beyond both countries to the Global South. Such a theory can also contribute to the design of informatisation policies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China; Everyday life; India; Information divides; Information seeking; Internet; Mixed methods"

We aim to understand the specific impacts of Internet use on senior citizens’ social participation meanwhile explore the reasons causing the abovementioned inconsistence in prior studies. We ran different panel regression models to address these questions based on a dataset drawn from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. Our empirical results indicate that seniors who are Internet users have higher social participation than those who do not use the Internet even after controlling out other influencing factors; however, frequent Internet use leads to less social participation among senior citizens. For senior citizens with higher cognitive functioning, both using Internet or not and the frequency of Internet use lead to more social participation. Both using Internet or not and the frequency of Internet use cause senior citizens with pensions to engage in fewer social activities. For female senior citizens, frequent Internet use leads to lower social participation.

These online group processes can have significant influence on user behavior, which is alarming when considering risky behaviors such as gambling. This study examined how online clique involvement predicts young people's interest in gambling content and following observed group norms on social media. Survey respondents were 15–25-year-olds from Finland (n = 1200), the United States (n = 1212), South Korea (n = 1192) and Spain (n = 1212). A self-reported measure of online clique involvement and a gambling-related social media vignette experiment were utilized. The results show that online clique involvement was related to higher interest in gambling content. Content liked by a majority gathered more interest, indicating conformity to a group norm. This finding was especially true among participants with past involvement in online cliques, and the association was strongest in South Korea. The tendency to participate in online clique behavior creates a potentially risky setting when encountering online gambling content, because it may accentuate the effect of observed group norms. Interacting with gambling content increases the visibility of such content due to algorithmic filtering technologies, which can fuel gambling-related intentions and behaviors, and normalize gambling. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Gambling; Group processes; Online cliques; Social media; Young people"

In order to minimize users’ problems with (rather annoying) ads on digital services, some providers offer user settings for the optimization of advertising. We analyzed the information behavior of Facebook users concerning ad settings with the help of an online survey (N = 1,021). Only about 40% of participating Facebook users know about personalization of settings of their advertising preferences. More than 20% of the users who work with Facebook's advertising optimization are satisfied since the changes, but 35% are unsatisfied, and another 32% have a generally negative attitude towards online advertising. To describe customers’ disregard or ignorance of settings we introduce the term “settings blindness.” Especially the users’ gender and their educational background influence the information behavior concerning advertisement settings. The results have practical implications for Facebook users (namely, setting their own preferences for ads and thus seeing only personally customized ads), for Facebook and other social media companies (producing less annoying ads leading to a better customer loyalty and maybe more trust in the service), and for advertisers on social media (improving the correct addressing of the target groups). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Advertising optimization; Facebook; Information behavior; Online advertising; Settings blindness; User settings"

Lonely people are more prone to experience the negative outcomes of PSMU, but only few studies have focused explicitly on how loneliness affects the relationship between PSMU and subjective well-being experiences. In this paper, we examine if loneliness influences the association between PSMU and life satisfaction. We used nationally representative cross-sectional data from Finnish social media users (N = 2991) and follow-up panel data (N = 2021). First, we tested if PSMU affects satisfaction with life indirectly through loneliness while controlling for a set of background variables. Next, we examined whether changes in PSMU and loneliness affect life satisfaction over time. First analyses showed that PSMU was associated with life satisfaction negatively, but the effect was largely confounded by loneliness. Longitudinal analysis revealed increased PSMU did not predict decreased satisfaction with life within individuals, but increased PSMU predicted increased loneliness, and increased loneliness predicted decreased satisfaction with life. The analyses indicate that loneliness is a crucial element that contributes to the relationship between PSMU and life satisfaction. In addition, earlier observations that PSMU might increase loneliness over time were confirmed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Life satisfaction; Loneliness; Longitudinal study; Panel design; Problematic social media use; Social media"

To resolve this paradox, we examine progression of the technologies’ diffusion instead, and in the process, seek to uncover the underlying dynamics of sentiments at play. Diffusion involves multiple actions by different parties, with social discourses via diverse media playing an essential role. In demonstrating the interplay of support to resistance via media framing and the diffusion of innovation theory, findings from our paper contribute to the technology adoption literature.

This scale contains four underlying dimensions: 1) users’ awareness of content filtering, 2) users’ awareness of automated decision-making, 3) users’ awareness of human-algorithm interplay, and 4) users’ awareness of ethical considerations. In validating the scale, results revealed strong psychometrics properties.

Based on standardized exams (SAT Suite) and a survey of rural Michigan students in grades 8–11, we find that rural students with broadband home Internet access are more interested in school and leave homework incomplete less often. However, the relationship to classroom grades (GPA) is relatively trivial. Yet, we find that students who are not dependent on a cell phone for Internet access and those with higher digital skills, especially social media skills, rank considerably higher on the SAT. Rural students with broadband Internet access are able to participate in a more diverse array of online media activities, which supports building digital skills. Any negative relationship between time spent on social media, video games, other digital media and educational outcomes is outweighed by the benefit to digital skills. However, aspects of rural culture; including the emphasis on activities such as sports, as a path to postsecondary schooling and upward, social mobility; may be stunting the positive relationship between access, digital skills, and educational aspirations. Whereas extra-curricular sports have no direct relationship to SAT performance, students who spend more time on sports receive higher grades and have higher educational aspirations than those with more digital skills. We discuss the implications for rural students’ access to human capital and how the unequal relationship between digital skills and performance in the classroom and on the SAT may perpetuate inequalities. © 2021 The Author(s)","Broadband; COVID-19; Digital inequality; Excessive use; Homework; Mobile; School interest; Sports"

We also explore the possibility of unobserved heterogeneity in consumers’ behavior, including potentially relevant segments of AI app adopters. To augment the knowledge of end users’ engagement and relevant segments, we have added two new antecedent variables into UTAUT2: technology fear and consumer trust. Prediction-orientated segmentation was used on 740 valid responses collected using a pre-tested survey instrument. The results show five segments with different behaviors that were influenced by the variables of the proposed model.

In this paper, we investigate whether this logical assertion is true. More importantly, we examine the interlinks among the variables in the short and long run. Directions of causal links among these variables are complex and sometimes subtle and it is therefore important to establish them through rigorous empirical analysis. For our study, we consider the G-20 countries over 1961–2019. Our study reveals a myriad of underlying temporal links among the variables. The key policy implication of these results is that long-term growth in this group of countries depends on greater co-development and harmonization of policies on ICT, FDI, and trade openness.

Results from an online survey of 426 Chinese Internet users lend support to the proposed theoretical model, which posits perceived health threat of common symptoms as a trigger of health anxiety that motivates OHIS through the perception of information insufficiency. In this process, positive source beliefs strengthen the effect of information insufficiency on OHIS.

They were randomly assigned to post a comment after reading a series of either all positive or all negative reviews of a branded product. We coded participants’ comments based on their preexisting attitude towards the product brand and grouped the participants into five behavioral types: 1) vocal and silent (normative) majorities (n = 235), 2) silent minorities (n = 75), 3) social conformers (n = 117), 4) vocal minorities (n = 95), and 5) “online trolls” (n = 46).

Although unexplored in the SSA context, previous research has indicated the significance of immersive experience and its influence on user's specific behavior through user attitude. The present study employs Structural Equation Modelling, by using 459 samples from a survey, to explore how the intensity of immersive experience can influence the degree of user dependency on SSA. Results indicate that immersive experience is positively associated with users’ positive attitudes towards SSA, which would lead to SSA dependency. In addition, this study also found out that users’ favorable attitude partially mediates the relationship between immersive experience and solitary play dependency. Whereas, attitude fully mediated the relationship between five out of six dimensions of SSA dependency. Furthermore, to better comprehend the intervening relationships between immersive experiences, user attitude, SSA dependency, the study also conducted a moderation analysis taking frequency of use as a moderating variable. The results illustrate that a high frequency of use is a strong psychological indicator for SSA dependency. This supports the importance of considering actual behavior along with their psychological states when examining users’ immersive experience and their SSA dependency. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Dependency; Immersive experience; Mediation; Moderation; Social Streaming Apps"

This study explores the privacy paradox in mHealth applications using an integrated elaboration likelihood model (ELM) from the perspective of privacy calculus and privacy fatigue. Results from the quasi-experiment and partial least squares structural equation modeling reveal that, compared with privacy concerns, perceived benefits have a greater impact on users’ disclosure intention, which further supports the existence of the privacy paradox in the mHealth context; this process is found to originate in users’ privacy calculus. However, privacy fatigue is found to have an insignificant impact on users’ disclosure intention, which may be due to the low sunk cost of users’ investment in mHealth applications.

Businesses are actively using pop-up ads in online games for advertising. However, research into the advertising value of pop-up ads and its effect on gamers’ inspiration states remains scarce. This study aims to deepen our understanding of the value of in-game pop-up ads by applying the Ducoffe advertising value model. Specifically, we investigated the factors that determine the advertising value of gamers’ inspired-by state and its resultant impact on the inspired-to state. Based on survey data of 321 online game players, the proposed conceptual model was tested using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) method. This study shows that incentives, entertainment, credibility, personalization, and irritation significantly impact the advertising value associated with online game pop-up ads. Additionally, this study empirically proves that the advertising value of in-game pop-up ads positively derives the inspired-by state, which in turn determines gamers’ inspired-to state. Beyond theoretical significance, this study offers several practical implications for advertising platforms and advertisers who want to attract gamers using pop-up ads. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","And Ducoffe's advertising model; Gamers' inspiration; Inspired-by; Inspired-to; Online gaming; Pop-up ads"

The attacks took place three days before the elections and changed the campaign's agenda, which centered around the issue of who was responsible for the attack: ETA or Al Qaeda. It also altered the agenda of the mass media, which focused its informative activity on broadcasting news related to this issue. We did an exhaustive selection process of all the news broadcast on television, radio, and newspapers that made reference to the authorship of the attack. Using these messages we developed an agent-based model for explaining how the political strategies implemented by political parties influenced the ideological distance. The proposed model is based on the ideological proximity model by Downs (1957). After calibrating and validating the model with real data, we simulated the effect of three political strategies from the theory of terror management on the ideological distance between voters and political parties: the rally around the flag, the opinion leadership, and the priming of public opinion and media coverage. The results show that these strategies have a significant and stable impact on the ideological distance. In particular, the rally around the flag can have a lasting effect, capable of changing the ideological distance in the short term after a terrorist attack. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based modeling; Spatial theory of voting; Terror management; Terrorist attack"

However, at least in Korea, male users seem not only to be more active in consuming online news but also in commenting online. Many previous studies have investigated the gender imbalance in news consumption of not only traditional media but also online media. Although a few studies explored gender differences in online comments on news, no study has investigated such gender differences using actual data on the basic profiles of commenters. To fill the gap between previous studies and reality and address the gender imbalance in online news comments and public opinion, this study examined the differences between male and female online news commenters. Furthermore, using actual data provided by Naver, the dominant Internet portal in Korea, this study analyzed the characteristics of female news commenters and those of news content where female users most actively commented. This study found that—at least in Korea—fewer women comment on news, they are less active than men, and that there is a difference between younger and older women. This study also found that people write more comments in a day as their age increases and the gender differences decrease with age. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Age; Equal participation; Gender difference; Gender imbalance; News comments; Online news; Public opinion"

We use a logit model and data set of 69 high- and middle-income countries for the period 2005–2015. We find a negative relationship between Internet use and education inequality for the whole sample. The results confirm that, in addition to the level of education and other socioeconomic variables, the distribution of formal education among citizens within a country is also important to explain Internet use. We also obtain that this distribution affects Internet use to a higher extent in middle-income economies in comparison with high-income ones. Unlike the positive influence of educational levels obtained in the academic literature, the existence of within-country educational disparities negatively influences Internet use.

Using a combination of convenience and snowball sampling, 218 participants were recruited to take part in a single-group post-test only quasi-experimental design. The findings of the study showed that visual complexity influences mobile app download intentions through the mediating role of two future-oriented emotions (i.e. hope and anticipated regret). Additionally, the study showed that the indirect effect of visual complexity on download intentions was moderated by feature overload with the importance of visual complexity significantly reducing as perceptions of feature overload increases.

This study aims to identify the mediating and moderating effects of poor sleep quality and loneliness in the association between Facebook addiction levels and depression among Vietnamese Facebook users. A cross-sectional study was conducted in October 2020 via an online survey. Participants received an invitation to join the study with a link to the questionnaire via Facebook. A total of 354 Facebook users completed survey about Facebook addiction, sleep quality, loneliness and depression. Results reveal that poor sleep quality partially mediated the association between Facebook addiction and depression (b = 0.117, SE = 0.027, CI = [0.066, 0.172]), and loneliness moderated this relationship (β = 0.023, SE = 0.008, CI = [0.007, 0.039]). This research not only enriches the theory of the association between Facebook addiction and depression, but also a basis for the development of intervention programs to prevent depression for Facebook addictors.

In particular, emerging digital peer-to-peer (P2P) payment applications further complicate how people deal with each other regarding money. Yet, there is a lack of empirical evidence on how and why such technology may lead to new and more complex influences on people's offline interpersonal relationships. Using 23 in-depth interviews, this paper explores the influences of using digital P2P payments on people's experiences of interpersonal financial exchanges and their offline interpersonal relationships. Our findings show that using digital P2P payments helps reduce awkwardness and ensure a stronger sense of fairness in financial exchanges. In addition, though digital P2P payments can relieve tension and reduce distrust in users’ interpersonal relationships, they also result in loss of emotion and increase peer pressure. We extend existing studies on computer-mediated interpersonal relationships by highlighting the important role of the complicated technology-mediated financial exchanges in perceiving, shaping, and approaching today's offline interpersonal relationships. We also propose potential design implications for designers and developers to take such an interplay of financial exchanges and interpersonal relationships into consideration to design more supportive and socially satisfactory digital P2P payment platforms in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Computer-mediated communication; Digital peer-to-peer (P2P) payment; Financial technologies; Interpersonal relationship"

One common way to protect our privacy is to remove identifiers (e.g., ID, name) from the records. This approach is known to be naive, as in many cases re-identification is enabled based on quasi-identifiers (e.g., age, gender). In this research we examine an interesting and unexpected new quasi-identifier – music selections of an individual which represents their musical preferences. In the current era we consume music mainly on-demand by streaming (e.g., Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music) rather than as broadcast. The prosperity of the various music platforms is immense, and so is the sharing of beloved music, for example on online social networks. Thus, the creation of records that represent music selections is prevalent. In this paper we introduce a methodology to re-identify users based on their music selections, and prove the efficiency of the methodology empirically in four experiments (n=22,38,35,30).

Prior research found that app functions may impact app efficacy. However, research to date has not sought to systematically investigate how different combinations of app functions impact user response to apps, especially adoption intent.

Study One used content analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis on 98 iPhone fitness apps and identified four app clusters: “Tutor”, “Recorder”, “Game Companion”, and “Cheerleader.” Tracking was the predominant function in current market, but tracking-focused Recorder apps received lowest user ratings among all app clusters. Users favored Tutor apps that combine exercise education and tracking, and Game Companion apps that combine gamification, tracking, and social functions. Function combinations, rather than standalone functions, impact app success. Following a Reasoned Action Approach, Study Two found various effects of individual differences (age, gender, BMI, eHealth literacy, smartphone experience, function preference) on user attitude toward different fitness app types. A comparison between two studies demonstrated a mismatch between market offerings and user needs regarding app functions.

Using a mixed-methods approach, this study aims to address this gap in the literature by examining the prevalence and context of two related behaviors: 1) password sharing and 2) accessing a best friend's phone without permission. We draw on both quantitative data and responses to open-ended questions that were collected among 2582 adolescents (ngirls = 1432, 56.6%) with a mean age of 13.45 years old (SD = 0.90) in the Dutch-speaking area of Belgium. Around half of the respondents in our sample had shared a password of a social media account or the PIN code of their mobile phone with their best friend, and 9.6% had accessed their best friend's phone without their consent. When investigating the underlying motivations for password sharing, our study revealed that passwords were mainly shared as a token of trust and friendship. Passwords were often exchanged reciprocally. Girls were significantly more likely to share their passwords or to access their best friend's phone without permission than boys. The respondents justified breaking into a best friend's phone by passing it off as a ‘joke’, or they claimed that they wanted to surprise their best friend.

In this situation, the travelers’ decision-making for tourism destinations was heavily affected by this global event. Social media usage has played an essential role in travelers’ decision-making and increased the awareness of travel-related risks from the COVID-19 outbreak. Online consumer media for the outbreak of COVID-19 has been a crucial source of information for travelers. In the current situation, tourists are using electronic word of mouth (eWOM) more and more for travel planning. Opinions provided by peer travelers for the outbreak of COVID-19 tend to reduce the possibility of poor decisions.

We use stated preference data from a discrete choice experiment and a mixed logit model to reflect consumers’ heterogeneity on information security threats and solutions. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of experiencing privacy leakage on attitudes toward CAV information security threats by dividing respondents into two groups. The results show that consumers regard communication failure and the unauthorized collection of personal information as dangerous information security threats, which implies that confidentiality and availability are more essential to CAV security than other factors. Moreover, convenience of use, such as having automatic updates and a security dashboard, is also important when purchasing a CAV information security solution. We also find that respondents who have experienced privacy leakage have a higher preference for protecting CAVs from information security threats than those who have not. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Connected and autonomous vehicles; Consumer behavior; Cyber threats; Discrete choice experiment; Transportation security"

Forecasting the market expansion strategies of these providers can thus shed light on their future actions and influence government policies. In this context, this is the first study to analyze consumer preferences for bundled pay-TV and OTT services. However, due to a lack of market data availability, we conducted a discrete choice experiment and analyzed the marginal utilities of attributes using a mixed logit model. The results demonstrate that consumers expect an additional discount for pay-TV services when bundled with OTT services and that the more bundled services they currently use, the less sensitive they are to the discount rate. Furthermore, we found that OTT and TV broadcasting services have a complementary, rather than a substitute, relationship. Finally, according to a simulation analysis for the Korean broadcasting market, bundling OTT services to expand the market share of pay-TV service providers was largely ineffective. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Broadcasting service; Bundling discount; Consumer preference; Discrete choice model; Over-the-top service; Subscription bundling"

Increasing use of information and communication technology (ICT) in everyday life changes individual time use and thus affects the associated energy requirements. ICT can have increasing or decreasing effects on energy use (e.g. it can reduce transport through virtual mobility or increase transport by creating the desire to travel to places seen on the Internet). Understanding the causal relationships between ICT, time, and energy use is essential to promote its desired impacts and prevent socially and environmentally unfavorable (unsustainable) ones. Despite various approaches to time use across disciplines, no consistent conceptual framework of the impact of ICT on time use and environmental impact exists so far. In this paper, we review existing literature on (1) ICT impacts on time use, and (2) environmental impacts of time use. Aiming to bridge differences across disciplines and methodological approaches, we develop a conceptual framework for systematically assessing the impact of ICT on time and energy use. The core of this framework is the categorization of ICT impacts on the relaxation of time and space constraints to activities, parallelization, fragmentation, substitution, avoidance, and delegation of activities, changes to the duration and manner of activities, changes to the process of activity planning, and generation of new ICT-based activities. In a broader systems perspective, these effects also trigger causal chains which can form feedback loops and thus change time-use patterns with some delay (systemic effects). Changes in time use affect direct energy requirements through the energy used to perform activities (e.g. in the form of electricity or fuels). Indirect energy requirements, the energy embedded in goods, only change if production of goods can be avoided (e.g. if telecommuting leads to fewer cars being purchased). The net energy impact of a given ICT use case depends on direct and indirect energy requirements of the activities performed before and after adoption of the use case. We demonstrate the application of the framework by qualitatively assessing time and energy use impacts of a frequently discussed ICT use case: telecommuting. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Activities; Energy use; Information and communication technology; Rebound effect; Time allocation; Time use"

For this reason, many studies have been conducted in this field in recent years. There is no research investigating how empathy is associated with excessive and problematic online social media use, whilst some studies have associated social media use with empathy as the main component of social development. Hence, the purpose of this study is to examine the influences of Empathic Concern (EC) and Perspective Taking (PT) on social media addiction (SMA). Moreover, prior studies revealed that Internet addiction behavior of individuals varies according to differences in personality traits. Accordingly, we further intend to understand how the impacts of EC and PT on SMA are intensified by considering individuals’ traits differences, and thus, personality traits were included in the research model as the moderators. To assess the research model, the data collected through the distributed printed questionnaire among 592 high-school 15–18 years old students (42.1% male) were analyzed utilizing the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach. The results revealed that both EC and PT significantly and negatively predict SMA. Furthermore, the moderating analysis showed that Extraversion negatively moderated the relationships between EC and SMA and PT and SMA. Further analysis revealed that while there were no differences across genders, behaviors associated with SMA were more common among students of high-income schools in contrast to low-income schools.

This paper adds analytical depth to, and broadens the geographical scope of, research on the variegated modes of making smart cities. Based on empirical research in multiple Australian cities we use three case studies to explore three different modes of smart urbanism, each one centred on the interests of a different key actor: corporate-centric, citizen-centric, and planner-centric. These different modes can, and do, co-exist in the same city. At times, they are competing logics that fight to pull the city in different directions. Yet, they can also work together to shape smart city initiatives. In describing these different modes, we pay particular attention to the ways that these projects and strategies must contend with the already existing spatial, cultural, and political contexts of each place. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Australia; Digital technology; Smart cities; Urban planning; Variegated urbanism"

For analysis, a network dataset was created using 221,105 retweets that included the hashtag #HimToo. This hashtag was used extensively during the US Senate judiciary committee hearing that investigated claims of sexual harassment against President Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The study demonstrates that three types of construction— i.e., actor-centric, memetic, and metaconstruction— causes polymorphism in Twitter engagement related to the event. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Media events; Networked events; Polymorphism; Social network analysis; Twitter"

Our results indicate that mobility, localizability, and personalization are positively associated with perceived value, which in turn, is positively associated with continuance intention. Our results show that perceived value partially mediates the relationships between mobility, personalization, and localizability (but not security) with continuance intention. Further, compatibility positively moderates the relationship between perceived value and mobility, localizability, and security (but not personalization), and between perceived value and continuance intention. Our results suggest that there is a tradeoff between personalization and security (analogous to personalization-privacy paradox where users are torn between their desire for personalization and their instinct to protect their privacy).

Taking a South Korean smart city of Songdo as a point of departure, this paper offers a genealogical understanding of a smart city that situates the current technics and technologies of data-driven urban governance within the broader context of South Korean history. Given the scarcity of a historically informed understanding of a smart city in the existing literatures on smart urbanism, this paper argues that a genealogical method helps us to counter the sweeping binarism that obscures the complexity and diversity of actually existing smart cities today. Through genealogy, this study underscores the multifaceted nature of the smart city, which consists of a combination of multiple urban diagrams that grows out of distinct problems and objectives of urban management – mobility, security, environment, and futurity. This paper illustrates how a smart city emerged out of multiple strings of history and problematizations that are contingently interweaved at a given time and space in multiple and diffused forms. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Diagrams; Foucault; Genealogy; Smart city; Songdo; South Korea"

We start from a living lab framework, underpinning the iterative process to integrate insights from all three perspectives within research projects. Then, we explain how the approach was applied within the HRADIO project1. This EU funded project focuses on the development of hybrid radio applications. We demonstrate how the process of building interdisciplinary scenarios and the involvement of multiple perspectives to evaluate these scenarios, has enabled both strategic decision making (1) and improved the technical development process within the HRADIO project (2). The first focuses on the (lack of) interest in certain scenarios from a business, technology and/or user perspective, to explain: (a) how these thresholds can be overcome and (b) what the consequences are for the project. The latter explains how we moved from interdisciplinary scenarios to a first Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that could be tested in the first pilot phase, to prototypes to be tested in the second pilot phase. To validate the importance of the scenarios, we also explain how the scenarios are integrated into the exploitation timeline. Finally, and importantly, we address how the process of multidisciplinary scenario building and evaluation can be improved. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Hybrid radio; Interdisciplinary scenarios; Living lab; Requirements engineering; Software architecture; Software engineering"

Previous studies on cyberbullying focused on detecting and classifying malicious comments. However, our study focuses on a substantive alternative to block malicious comments via identifying key offenders through the application of methods of text mining and social network analysis (SNA). Thus, we propose a practical method of identifying social network users who make high rates of insulting comments and analyzing their resultant influence on the community. We select the Korean online community of Daum Agora to validate our proposed method. We collect over 650,000 posts and comments via web crawling. By applying a text mining method, we calculate the Losada ratio, a ratio of positive-to-negative comments. We then propose a cyberbullying index and calculate it based on text mining. By applying the SNA method, we analyze relationships among users so as to ascertain the influence that the core users have on the community. We validate the proposed method of identifying key cyberbullies through a real-world application and evaluations. The proposed method has implications for managing online communities and reducing cyberbullying. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Centrality; Cyberbully; Cyberbullying; Cyberbullying index; Losada ratio; Social network analysis; Text mining"

However, few studies have identified and explained the mechanisms underlying affective polarization. Using two online experiments, we examine the mechanisms through which ratings induce affective polarization. Findings support warranting theory by consistently showing that counter-attitudinal ratings indirectly drive up affective polarization by increasing positive in-party affect via perceived manipulation. By contrast, pro-attitudinal star ratings polarize by increasing positive in-party affect through perceived in-party prototypicality. These findings challenge assumptions that affective polarization is solely characterized by negative out-party affect, and driven mainly by exposure to counter-attitudinal information. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Affective polarization; Online ratings; Partisan cues; Social identity; Warranting"

Our findings show that both internet and mobile technologies increase the level of democracy in our sample countries. When considering the level of economic development, divergent results are reported for developing and developed countries. Developing countries most commonly have autocratic political regimes where internet and mobile content is monitored by government authorities. More ICT diffusion produces in these cases a negative impact on their level of democracy. Moreover, these countries do not show any presence of a threshold of ICT use necessary to enhance their level of democracy. Our findings however report the presence of a nonlinear relationship in developed countries, suggesting that the effectiveness of ICT in enhancing democracy increases as more users are connected to ICT networks. Our findings also show that unlike developing countries, press freedom and ICT adoption are complementary in developed countries. That is, when developed countries are better endowed with ICT, they can enhance the freedom of their press and therefore their level of democracy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Corruption; Democracy; ICT diffusion; Nonlinear"

Understanding the antecedents of such decisions and the moderators that govern the antecedent effects can help users reach such decisions, and assist service providers in mitigating them. From a theoretical standpoint, there is a need to enrich the theoretical account of social media discontinuance phenomena. To address these issues, we integrate the “stimulus-organism-response” (S-O-R) framework and flow theory. We consequently portray the direct, indirect and moderating roles of flow experience in mitigating discontinuance intentions. We test this model via a survey of 502 WeChat users. The results support the S-O-R model and indicate that social overload, information overload, and communication overload (stimuli) increase the fatigue feelings (organism) of social media users, which, in turn, increase their social media discontinuance intentions (response). By combining the S-O-R perspective with flow theory, we show that flow experience not only help reduce users’ perceptions of fatigue and discontinuance intentions, but also moderate (weaken) the effects of fatigue on discontinuance intentions. Flow experience, therefore, serves as a means to inhibit the formation of social media discontinuance intentions, even when overload and fatigue persist. The present research also has several valuable theoretical and practical implications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Discontinuance intentions; Fatigue; Flow experience; Overload; S-O-R theory; Social media"

Citations are widely used to measure the different aspects of knowledge-based achievements such as institutional ranking, author ranking, the impact factor of the journal, research grants, and peer judgments. A fair evaluation of research required a quantitative and qualitative assessment of citations. To perform the qualitative analysis of citations, researchers tried to classify the citations into binary classes (i.e., important and non-important). To perform this task, researchers used metadata, content, citations count, cue words or phrases, sentiment analysis, keywords, and machine learning approaches for citation classification. However, the state-of-the-art results of binary classification are inadequate for the calculation of different aspects of the researcher and their work. Therefore, this research proposed an in-text citation sentiment analysis-based approach for binary classification which effectively enhanced the results of the state-of-the-art. In this research, different machine learning-based models are evaluated to determine the in-text citations sentiments. These sentiment results are further used for positive-negative, and neutral citation counts. Furthermore, the scores of cosine similarity between paper citation pairs are also calculated and used as a feature. This sentiment and cosine similarity scores are further used as features in binary classification. The classification is performed through SVM, KLR, and Random Forest. The proposed approach is evaluated and compared with two state-of-the-art approaches on the benchmark dataset. The proposed approach can achieve 0.83 f-measure with the improvement of 13.6% for dataset 1 and 0.67 with an improvement of 8% for dataset two with a random forest classification model. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bernoulli NB; Citation classification; Cosine similarity; In-text citation; KNN; Linear SVC; Logistic regression; Multinomial Naïve Bayes; Sentiment analysis"

The study aims to assess the functionality of Artificial Intelligence to measure tourists’ emotions and hence their satisfaction with the quality of the service provided on a guided tour when visiting a UNESCO heritage site. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology comprises the following stages. Firstly, the emotions are analysed through data recorded by using a software application on facial-expression recognition on a sample of tourists visiting a heritage site. Secondly, the tourists were asked to rate their overall satisfaction with the guided tour visit. Finally, a structural equation modelling approach is used to validate the strong relation between emotions and satisfaction. Findings: The results achieved confirm that the information obtained from facial-expression recognition demonstrated that it is as valid an instrument as that offered by the self-administered questionnaires for the measurement of customer satisfaction. The findings from the application reveal that a change in the scientific and professional field is emerging in the measurement of customer satisfaction focused on the emotions from a digital approach. Research limitations/implications: This research is mainly based on the use of specific software for facial-expression recognition with its intrinsic measurement of emotions with and in a specific heritage scenario. Other scenarios and software of a more sophisticated nature implemented in the tourism and hospitality industry are necessary for the in-depth comprehension of the significant role played by emotions in the improvement of service quality. Practical implications: The recent application of recording emotions in the Tourism Industry provides practitioners with useful insights for the detection of deficiencies in their services and therefore the means to boost their reputation and destination image. Originality/value: Artificial Intelligence presents a new paradigm in the measurement of satisfaction by substituting self-administered surveys with a method based on the use of innovative software that recognizes faces and detects emotions through facial expressions.

Conceptualizing retweeting as a process of amplification, this study examines how attention to a particular set of issues may be increased by the actions of verified users or social media publics on the largest Chinese microblogging website, Sina Weibo. The Granger-causality test was applied to analyze the sequential linkage between original posts and retweets by different user groups across days 1 to 14. The results show that verified users’ original posts on unobtrusive issues triggered related retweets only in their own network, while social media publics’ original posts on both unobtrusive and obtrusive issues triggered related retweets within their own group. In addition, the results demonstrate that amplification of different types of issue exhibits systematically different temporalities, that is, the response to obtrusive issues is more immediate and ephemeral than that response to unobtrusive issues. The findings highlight the possibilities and limitations of grassroots empowerment through social media in China, and provide meso-level evidence about the complex issue of attention flows in social media – whether bottom-up or top-down. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Amplification; Elite users; Granger causality; Microblogging; Political communication; Social media publics"

The partner tends to be unaware that they are being ghosted. As a result, the ghosted partner is left to manage and understand what lack of his/her partner's communication means. The present study was designed to explore if people who are ghosted are more likely to ghost others by analyzing to what extent ghosting initiation is correlated with ghosting victimization, and by also examining to what extent intentions to ghost are related to ghosting behaviors (both being ghosted and being a ghoster). It also examined the relations between ghosting initiation behavior and intention and individual, interpersonal and relationship factors, such as self-esteem, sense of power, moral disengagement, assertiveness, empathy concern and conflict resolution styles. Data were collected from 626 adults (mean age = 29.64 years; SD = 8.84) using online surveys.

Furthermore, although the Internet offers a world of potentially rewarding experiences, there is much heterogeneity among older people with respect to those who are able to benefit from its use. To reduce this gap, public access and digital literacy programs have been implemented. The aim of the study was to find out the extent to which these programs moderate the effects of age and socioeconomic status on social access to and use of the Internet in a sample of older users in Spain. Through quota sampling of retired users over 54 years of age in Spain (N = 560), who were regular users of public supports for Internet access, a structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis was conducted. The data showed a staggered association of access indicators (physical access, digital skills and social e-activities) on the social gratifications obtained, as well as the moderating role of institutional supports. This study provides empirical evidence of the ability of public supports to moderate the effect of socioeconomics inequalities on access and social exploitation of the Internet by older people.

This study aims to investigate drivers of users’ satisfaction and continuance intention toward chatbot-based customer service. We propose an analytical framework combining the expectation-confirmation model (ECM), information system success (ISS) model, TAM, and the need for interaction with a service employee (NFI-SE). Analysis of data collected from 370 actual chatbot users reveals that information quality (IQ) and service quality (SQ) positively influence consumers’ satisfaction, and that perceived enjoyment (PE), perceived usefulness (PU), and perceived ease of use (PEOU) are significant predictors of continuance intention (CI). The need for interaction with an employee moderates the effects of PEOU and PU on satisfaction. The findings also revealed that satisfaction with chatbot e-service is a strong determinant and predictor of users’ CI toward chatbots. Thus, chatbots should enhance their information and service quality to increase users’ satisfaction. The findings imply that digital technologies services, such as chatbots, could be combined with human service employees to satisfy digital users. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chatbots; Continuance intention; ECM; ISS model; Satisfaction; TAM; The need for interaction"

It is also imperative for practitioners and researchers to understand the adverse effects of problematic Internet and mobile device usage in the workplace. Moreover, findings from existing studies are insufficient or less relevant or lack applicability in the context of workplace safety behavior. This paper contributes to the literature by examining the mechanisms in which problematic Internet usage lowers workers safety behavior and the moderating role of time autonomy. Data was obtained from workers in the Turkish maritime industry using a simple random sampling technique (n = 344) and analyzed with partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Results from PLS-SEM demonstrate that problematic Internet use reduces safety behavior and time autonomy enhances safety behavior. Time autonomy attenuates the negative impact of problematic Internet use on safety behavior. Unlike previous studies, this paper highlights the pernicious effects of problematic Internet use and beneficial effects of time autonomy in shaping modern workplace safety behaviors. Based on these results, several managerial prescriptions and theoretical implications are rendered, and future research directions are highlighted. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Digitalization; Mobile device usage; Problematic Internet usage; Safety behavior; Time autonomy; Turkish maritime industry"

Yet levels of cloud service adoption vary, with limited adoption in many countries. For broader transformation, it is important to understand the predictors of CC adoption in order to design effective promotion policies. This study employs an institutional perspective to model technological and environmental predictors of country-level CC adoption, as measured through a nation's per capita CC expenditure. The model was validated through an econometric analysis using panel data for 45 countries globally over a five-year period. Legal system quality and broadband penetration, among other determinants, are found to be robust predictors of CC adoption. At the same time, we uncover evidence for the “digital legacy” problem, in which trade-dependent countries struggle to enhance CC adoption because their export-oriented firms have invested in more traditional digital assets. Finally, we find that countries with large service sectors have relatively high current levels of CC adoption but low growth in adoption. The study makes contributions by identifying these key predictors and providing policy implications for the promotion of CC adoption. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Broadband penetration; Cloud computing adoption; Cross-country panel study; Institutional theory; Legal system quality; Promotion policies"

However, there can be several impediments to optimal Internet utilization in the form of access, skills, and motivation. Even when access is available, several digital inequalities arise as citizens often lack the skills and motivations to pursue those vital uses through the Internet to the best of their advantage. Digital inequalities in the hills of the Appalachian area of Ohio are often manifested in terms of social, cultural and geographic divides. Not only do the hills block wireless signals and make cables expensive to install, but regional poverty also drives away telecom investment. We conducted a survey of Appalachian Ohio to explore digital inequity issues and the determinants of online participation for things that matter. Through a number of analyses, we explore how Internet access and digital skills impact online contribution to the community in terms of services and resources considered to be basic social needs: health, employment, education, and social media. These social needs, what we have called Vital Internet Use (VIU) can determine citizens’ political and civic participation, societal contribution, and overall benefit to their communities.

Extant research, however, has provided neither consistent findings regarding the extent and direction of such relationships nor consensus on potential moderators involved. To provide robust conclusions about the association between social media use and employee outcomes which could inform research and practice, a systematic culmination of findings from 29 empirical works published in peer-reviewed journals from 2009 to 2018 was conducted. The meta-analytic review assessed the relationships between employees’ social media use and employee outcomes (job performance, job satisfaction, work engagement, emotional exhaustion, and work-life conflict) and their moderators (types of social media, purposes of use, and background variables). The results of the random-effects model suggest that social media use, in general, had significant, small, positive relationships with job performance, job satisfaction, work engagement, and work-life conflict. Its relationship with emotional exhaustion, however, was significant but negligible. The sub-group and meta-regression analyses further identified the moderators among the positive associations found: purpose of social media use moderated the relationships of social media use with job performance and job satisfaction while job position moderated the association between social media use and job satisfaction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Employee outcomes; Meta-analysis; Social media; Social network sites; Work communication"

We conduct a comparative analysis using the two models in the context of smartphones. Our results using model 1 show that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, fashion involvement, and flow are all significant factors in technology acceptance and use by digital natives (i.e. those under 34 years old). The results of model 2, which divides digital immigrants into two groups, reveal that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and flow are significant for digital immigrants who perceive themselves to be younger than their chronological age. For digital immigrants who perceive themselves to be as old as or order than their chronological age (cognitive age> = 34 years old), only perceived usefulness is significant. Finally, we discuss these results and make suggestions relevant to technology acceptance and use in different cognitive age groups. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Age; Cognitive age; Fashion behavior; Technology acceptance and smartphones"

In response, a new method to investigate and subsequently intervene is warranted. Therefore, this study analyzed big data generated by social media to identify Future Signals of bullying. This approach may contribute to effectively clarifying the problem and suggesting targeted interventions to address the bullying phenomenon in South Korea. For social big data analysis, 350,314 web documents were collected per hour each day from January 1, 2013 to June 30, 2017, from 279 subject channels based on an ontology of bullying-related topics. Term frequency, document frequency, degree of visibility, and degree of diffusion were computed to identify Future Signals. A substantial overlap of findings between studies based on social big data and traditional survey results was observed for family (e.g., parental divorce, domestic violence, child abuse), peer (e.g., transfer, friend violence), economic (e.g., economic problem), and school/academic (e.g., academic record, school control, academic stress) strain domains, whereas strains concerning the media (e. g., movie, celebrity) and cultural (e.g., materialism, hell Korea) domains seemed to be more salient in social big data. Weak Signal topics in social big data representing media and cultural strain domains (e.g., Youtube, class society, bullying culture) related to the bullying phenomenon appear to be emerging in significance. These topics and their respective strain domains represent potentially important new areas that warrant further investigation by practitioners and policymakers.

Understanding the antecedents of users’ discontinuance intention can help social media platforms in mitigating them. It is necessary to enrich the theoretical account of social media discontinuance intention from the aspect of negative information-related incidents. With this realization, underpinned by stimulus–organism–response (SOR) framework, the current study examined the interrelationships of negative information-related incidents, social media fatigue, perceived information overload, and social media discontinuance intention. The proposed hypotheses were verified by analyzing the responses of 328 Weibo users through structural equation modeling (SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). According to the SEM results, all negative-related information incidents can explain perceived information overload and social media fatigue, which in turn lead to discontinuance intention. The fsQCA findings also confirmed the significance of discontinuance intention determinants and provided the configurations that enhanced discontinuance intention. These findings can assist social media managers in developing unique strategies to address the specific needs of social media users. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Discontinuance intention; Negative information-related incidents; Social media; SOR framework"

However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, people were advised and even forced by governments to stay home and avoid social contact to slow down the spreading of the virus. The major LBG developers reacted by making in-game adjustments that allow playing from home, while still maintaining some incentives for players to go outdoors and socialise. For investigating factors influencing intention to play LBGs socially during the on-going pandemic, we collected cross-sectional survey data (N = 855) from Finnish players of the most popular LBG, Pokémon GO. The results showed that perceived severity of the pandemic and a positive attitude towards both governmental measures and in-game changes for combatting COVID-19 predicted intention to reduce social playing. Fear of missing out and deficient self-regulation increased playing intensity, which in turn negatively correlated with the intention to reduce social playing. Our findings demonstrate the influence that LBGs can have on human behaviour even during global crises such as COVID-19.

Using data from the 2019 Australian Open grand slam period, the authors examine Adler's (1985) theoretical construct in the context of sports and social media. A social listening tool is used to probe more than 2 million posts and comments mentioning elite male and female tennis players on four major social media channels: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, over the grand slam period. It is shown that the effect of professional tennis players on social media user engagement extends beyond their talent. A selection of players had a strong positive impact on prompting social media activity, even after accounting for factors related to their performance, the tournament rounds in which they were featured and the opponents against whom they played. Furthermore, the connection between social media research and sports economics is considered by examining the relationship between a player's effects on social media engagement and her/his differential influence on demand for tickets at the Australian Tennis Open.

However, the mechanisms on how members co-create value in online health communities (OHCs) have been poorly investigated. Therefore, this study develops a model of how belongingness and social support affect the four value co-creation behaviors (i.e., information sharing, responsible, feedback, and advocacy behaviors) in OHCs based on need-to-belong theory and social support literature. Our survey data from 237 OHC members empirically show that informational, emotional, esteem, and companionship supports positively influence members’ belongingness to OHCs, which in turn affects information sharing, responsible, feedback, and advocacy behaviors. Members’ belongingness to OHCs mediates the relationships between the four forms of social support and value co-creation behavior. In addition, OHC members’ perceived health competence positively moderates the influence of belongingness on information-sharing behavior, whereas their mental health negatively moderates the relationships of belongingness with all four value co-creation behaviors. Therefore, promoting value co-creation relies on the improvement of member belongingness, but it should also consider the health competence and status of members. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Belongingness; Health competence; Online health community; Social support; Value co-creation behavior"

In Timeline that U.S. users feel proximal to, an ad message focusing on low construal terms (vs. high construal terms) led to more favorable response. However, Korean Facebook users did not exhibit varying psychological distances from those two Facebook pages. Rather, they consistently preferred high-level construal messages regardless of where the ad messages were posted. The importance of this study is the suggestion that cultural orientation and social media usage need to be considered for the development of particular ad messages that engage social media users across the globe. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Construal level theory; Cultural orientation; Psychological distance; Social media usage"

We hypothesized that anthropomorphism on a brand's Facebook fan page can strengthen the relationships between brands and consumers by yielding both social presence and a positive inference regarding the brand's quality as a relationship partner. Our longitudinal experiment confirmed the effects of brand anthropomorphism on consumer-brand relationships on social media and the mediating role of social presence. The results suggest that when the anthropomorphized brand had relationships with consumers, a favorable attitude was shown toward the brand. Further, the participants perceived the anthropomorphized brand as a trustworthy relationship partner, giving more “Likes” for the posts from the anthropomorphized brand than those from the non-anthropomorphized brand. Further, the results confirmed that these favorable relationships were maintained even after the participants became aware of a brand transgression. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Brand anthropomorphism; Consumer-brand relationships; Fan page; Social networking sites; Social presence"

Many researchers have investigated consumers’ responses to mobile payment services, which is a key indicator of the success of a service, and have examined determinants of consumer adoption. Although many studies have addressed consumer adoption of mobile payment services, only the general and abstract factors affecting adoption (e.g., perceived usefulness) have been intensively investigated. However, these studies have rarely examined the idiosyncratic and concrete aspects of mobile payment services. To improve our understanding of why consumers adopt certain mobile payment services, this study investigated consumers’ evaluations of the explicit attributes of the services. Three hundred seventy-three consumers of mobile payment services participated in an online conjoint survey. Their preference structure was generated from a conjoint analysis including five service attributes (mobile payment platform, assurance policy, mileage program, authentication method, and affiliated stores), which were identified through a literature review and focus group discussion. The results showed that an assurance policy is the most critical factor influencing consumers’ choices, and a mileage program is considered to be as imperative as the platform. We also compared the findings by two consumer clusters (safety seekers vs. platform adherers), which were classified by preference. Because this study examines concrete and specific attributes of mobile payment services beyond abstract and general adoption factors, it provides insights into consumers’ actual adoption of services. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Affiliated stores; Assurance policy; Authentication method; Conjoint analysis; Mileage program; Mobile payment"

However, little is known about the use of mobile games while adolescents are stressed and exhausted. Drawing on the framework of recovery experiences, this study examined: (a) which mobile game cluster can elicit the highest recovery experiences for adolescent players? And (b) what drives them to play mobile games for stress recovery purposes? To answer these questions, a probability sample of 638 adolescents was recruited from 14 high schools in Shenzhen, China. Results showed that social mobile games characterized by high sociability but low control complexity had the highest potential to elicit recovery experiences, as it was positively related to relaxation, mastery, and control experience. The recovery dimension of psychological detachment and relaxation were found positively related to the use of mobile games for stress recovery purposes, whereas mastery and control experiences were not. Among all five adolescent stressors, only peer pressure was found positively correlated with the use of mobile games while adolescents were stressed and exhausted. Theoretical implications for understanding the relationships among four recovery dimensions and practical implications for promoting the positive effects of mobile gaming for adolescent players were discussed. © 2020","Adolescents; Game-induced recovery; Mobile games; Peer pressure; Recovery experiences"

In order to address such research gap, the objective of this present article is to provide a review of academic, peer-reviewed journal studies that examined the potential effect of social media engagement on international university students’ acculturation process, coping strategies, and psychological adjustments during the period from 2010 to 2019. Moreover, building upon conceptualizations from new media and transcultural research literature, a conceptual framework was developed to classify the relevant studies for further analysis. Overall, these theories and studies synthesized in this paper emphasize the vital role of social media in the acculturation, coping behaviors and mental health for ethnic minorities in the host country. Additionally, certain dimensions of attitudes and behaviors through social media could exert the important influence on the psychological adaption. Therefore, conclusions of the research may assist to further inform practitioners who may encounter newcomers’ experiencing intercultural adjustments and psychological issues in the digital media age. Furthermore, this current review may also help educators determine certain barriers that have not been resolved in campus tactics which may influence the acculturation of sojourning populations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Acculturation; Coping strategies; International students; Psychological consequences; Social media; Systematic review"

Drawing on survey data collected in the United States and Singapore, this study investigates the role of political interest, cognitive ability, and social network size in inadvertent deepfakes sharing. The findings suggest that those with higher political interests are more likely to share deepfakes inadvertently. Those with lower cognitive ability are also more likely to share deepfakes inadvertently. The moderation findings suggest that the relationship between political interest and deepfakes sharing is significantly moderated by network size. As such, the likelihood of politically interested citizens sharing deepfakes intensifies in more extensive social networks.

Tracking these promises and ideas, this paper explores “smart urbanism” in ten cities from all over Israel. Based on interviews with leading figures in municipalities, smart city consultants and key figures in technological companies (n = 40), the aims of this paper are to assess the efforts of cities to become smart by responding to the following questions: 1. What is guiding the decision-making process in developing technological initiatives? 2. Does context play a role in implementing technological initiatives? 3. How are the residents perceived, and what tools are being used to address residents' digital differences? The key argument of this paper is threefold: first, in the process of becoming a smart city, the roles of public and private actors are blurred, influencing the process of decision making. Second, despite contextual differences, cities adopt similar digital initiatives. Third, technological initiatives that focus on social needs and address inequality in the digital age are still at the margins. The final discussion suggests that most municipalities are still at an early stage of digitization implementation and have the ability to shape and form a vision for the cities as socio-technological ecosystems in a way that will serve their publics as a whole. The paper ends with a call for shifting the focus from the city to society in developing digital initiatives and cultivating smart social urbanism. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Digitalization; Private companies; Public sector; Smart governance; Strategic planning"

Across the north Atlantic, these are typically waterfront urban renewal projects that repurpose formerly industrial land contiguous to the city centre into fully master-planned sites that also include smart city developments. Our case study focuses on the governance and spatial planning of waterfront innovation districts in Boston in the United States and Dublin in Ireland. Both cases reflect a trend to create high-value clusters attracting research and development from globalised tech firms as well as fostering local enterprise. The fluidity and mobility of multinational capital attached to the tech economy leverages digital and civic investment in these districts as a means of corporate attraction and retention: the smart city becomes one for skilled, globally-mobile tech workers adjacent to, but socially and spatially partitioned from, historically working class port communities. This process is marked by the degree to which such districts can be, firstly, disconnected from city-wide planning agendas, and secondly, the degree to which they interface and share resources and amenities with surrounding neighbourhoods. Thus, we argue, there is the potential for further market capture of urban revitalisation policies by high-tech firms, leading to the creation of ‘corporate towns’ and a new era of uneven development. The politics of urban planning can both restrict the democratic process in the city, and curtail the forms of smart city, civic technologies into those primarily beneficial for high-tech corporations and their workforce. © 2020 The Authors","Boston; Dublin; Innovation districts; Smart urbanization; Urban planning"

Gamification is the use of technology to promote and induce the user's internal motivation by exploiting the game's characteristics. Recently, mobile learning applications introduce various gamification strategies to provoke users' voluntary participation. However, empirical evidence on how to attract users and influence sustained usage is limited. This study establishes a theoretical basis for designing learning applications and discusses its impact on business. A series of gamification strategies such as Competition, Challenge, Compensation, Relationship, and Usability, were applied to a company's Mobile Social Learning Platform (MSLP). A survey result of 293 users from South Korea was used for the advanced mediation model analysis. The result showed that Challenge, Relationship, and Usability had affected Flow and Continuous usage intention.

Using data spanning eight years from a Chinese nationwide political forum, we examined how citizens’ government contacting behavior relates to a series of theoretically relevant factors such as resources, social problems, and value systems. The data show a substantial increase in online citizen-initiated contacts in China from 2011 to 2018, with vast regional variation. In addition, we find that resources, social problems, and political value play important roles in explaining citizen contact frequency. More specifically, resource is positively associated with the number of citizen contact; high levels of social problem urge people to contact government; and people from provinces with more intense traditional political value are more likely to contact the government. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China; Citizen-initiated government contacts; Grievances; Resources; Values"

While there is significant research regarding user motivation on dating apps such as Bumble, Tinder, and Match.com, there is no published research that discusses the motivations of Mutual app users. Developed as a dating app to target members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Mutual allows users to find potential mates who share their religious background and specify their relationship readiness (from “Into Dating I Guess” to “Ready for a Ring”). This research aims to illuminate the various motivations, attitudes, and opinions of Mutual app users through Q methodology, which identifies perceptual groups among homogeneous populations through a factor analysis of participants’ agreement with similar statements regarding Mutual use. Findings indicated four factor groups: the Relationship Readies (i.e., those serious about dating), the Swipeaholics (i.e., those looking for entertainment), the Faithless (i.e., those who felt pressured to use Mutual), and the Eligible Optimists (i.e., those who saw the app as a convenient, entertaining way to date). Different from other research on dating apps, this study indicates that people may use a niche religion-focused dating app to find individuals with similar moral values or due to external pressure from others.

Such a business model helps gamers attain gaming goals while cultivating their gaming habits. Gaming habits can lead gamers to play games automatically, indicating their impact on gamers. However, little is known about how gaming habits affect gamers’ perceptions of the prices of the gaming items, goal-attaining motivation, and online gamer loyalty. Grounded in the consistency principle, we construct a framework to explain how gaming habits impact motivation to attain gaming goals, perceived price fairness, and online gamer loyalty. We collected 5,144 responses from online gamers and used structural equation modelling to test the research model. We found that gaming habits are positively related to motivation to attain gaming goals and perceived price fairness, which are further positively related to online gamer loyalty. Ours is the first study using the perspective of the consistency principle to examine the mechanism underlying the impact of gaming habits on online gamer loyalty. Our findings provide novel insights for electronic commerce managers that they could focus on enhancing perceived price fairness and motivation to attain gaming goals, thus establishing a loyal user base.

The current study seeks to fill this gap by capturing the simultaneous association between digital inclusion and QoL. This study employs simultaneous equation models based on a two-stage and full-information likelihood method using a household-level longitudinal dataset of Australia to explore the relationship between QoL and digital inclusion. This research confirms that digital inclusion significantly predicts QoL and vice versa. Socio-economic advantages, remoteness, rural-urban divide and lifestyle also appear to be significant determinants of the QoL.

Drawing upon a two-year study of large-scale digital platforms in US cities, this paper investigates conflicts over data sharing between city transportation departments and ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Lyft. By maintaining data monopolies, platform companies obfuscate the detrimental impacts of their services (e.g., increased congestion and pollution, dangers to cyclists and pedestrians) and interfere with city transportation planners’ tasks of diagnosing city needs and providing services for the public good. Ride-hailing companies’ resistance to data sharing serves the strategic goals of prolonging monopoly status and slowing regulation for maximum capital extraction, but I argue that it also performs a more insidious function of entrenching platform practices and logics, making alternatives difficult to imagine or implement.

Independent living, in this context, refers to the freedom elderly people have to live their lives in ways that they find important. Borrowing from the capability approach (CA) framework from Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen, the core argument of this paper is that elderly people make decisions on whether to use digital healthcare technologies by considering how these technologies enhance their capabilities to live their lives in ways that are valuable to them. This paper develops a theoretical model of adoption of digital healthcare technologies that support independent living applying the CA framework. We follow a mixed-methods approach with a sequence of qualitative, quantitative, and qualitative methods. We find support for our theoretical model, specifically that the intention to use online healthcare portals depends on whether elderly people expect to enhance their capabilities for living independently by using them. Our study contributes to the information systems literature on adoption of digital healthcare technologies as it is the first that applies the capability approach. For adoption studies on digital technologies in healthcare and beyond, our study poses two major theoretical implications: (1) when considering how outcome expectations affect adoption, scholars should consider how digital technologies allow people to live their lives in ways that are valuable to them, rather than considering how technologies help to execute predefined tasks, jobs, or activities; (2) the availability of digital technologies should be considered as a mediator between outcome expectations and intention to use technologies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Age-in-place; Capability approach; e-Health; Independent living"

While most research is focused on understanding situational effects on self-disclosure, the role of situational factors in users’ decision to consent for third-party access to information, a common practice with significant privacy implications, has been barely investigated. The current study bridges this gap by adopting the framework of situational privacy to examine the effect of the purpose for information collection on participants' consent. An online experiment examined users' consent to allow access to their Facebook profile to an unknown entity, with requests distinguished by the framing of the purpose for collecting information as related to security, commercial or academic research. Contrary to the study's hypothesis, consent rate was similar between groups and purpose was non-significant in explaining participants’ decisions. Furthermore, in all three groups- compensation amount and general willingness to disclose information explain user consent, regardless of purpose. However, some specific factors significantly correlate with consent in each group separately. The study concludes that due to blurring boundaries and uncertainties regarding real uses of information, when it comes to consent for third-party access, predetermined attitudes and preferences are main factors influencing users’ decisions, thus a situational framework is partly adequate for explaining variations in user consent decisions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Academic surveillance; Consent; Contextual privacy; Economic surveillance; Privacy; Security surveillance; Situational privacy"

At a time when 5G commercialization is incipient, it is necessary to understand mobile communication service users who are likely to be important initial users for the creation and diffusion of 5G services. The current study analyzed consumer preference for 5G services based on conjoint survey data and a mixed logit model, and we conducted a market simulation based on the estimation results to determine the impact of 5G technology development on the 5G market, specifically regarding the mobile communication fields. In addition, this study derived consumer purchase delay factors for 5G services using an ordered logit model. The results show that consumers delay the adoption of 5G services mainly because of the cost and lack of need. By considering the consumer purchase delay, it is estimated that the acceptance rate of 5G services by consumers will decrease by more than 50%; this is because it is hard to conclude a purchase delay of more than one year leads to an actual purchase. The results of this study suggest important strategic implications that are likely to reduce the purchase delay of consumers, improve the actual adoption rate, and increase the diffusion of 5G services. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","5G service; Conjoint analysis; Connected vehicle; Consumer preference; Internet of things; Purchase delay; Willingness to pay"

However, the diffusion of alternative offline payment systems such as mobile or biometric payments is slower than expected. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze consumer preferences for payment systems and examine the effects of consumers’ characteristics on the marginal utility of mobile and biometric payments. It uses the discrete choice experiment consisting of five major attributes to estimate preference parameters, and analyzes the data using the mixed logit model. The results show that consumers preferred cards to mobile and biometric payments even if they displayed the same level of related attributes. The scenario analysis results based on consumer preferences also showed the need to develop the overall attribute level of mobile and biometric payments. Furthermore, consumers’ positive attitude or innovativeness toward hi-tech products has a significantly positive effect on preferences for alternative payments. Based on the results, this study provides theoretical implications for consumer preference studies on payment systems and proposes market strategies for the diffusion of major next-generation payment systems from multiple aspects. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biometric payment; Conjoint analysis; Mixed logit model; Mobile payment; Payment systems; Scenario analysis"

In order to enhance students’ better understanding of course contents and theoretical knowledge, increasing number of academicians are incorporating service learning in their curriculum. However, less attention has been given to the effective integration of technology in this pedagogy. To address this issue, this study imparts a significant contribution in the overall body of knowledge by developing a technology integration framework for service learning programs. Our proposed framework comprises of three main components, i.e. (1) identification of common phases for service learning implementation, which are drawn on Kolb's (1984) experiential learning theory; (2) technology support layer and; (3) stakeholders’ involvement patterns in service learning. Design science research methodology was employed for developing our proposed Technology Integration Framework for Service Learning (TIFSL) in this study. Moreover, in order to evaluate our proposed framework, a case study was also conducted, where data was collected through semi-structured interviews and survey based questionnaires. Findings of this study demonstrate that three main components of our proposed framework determine the effective technology integration in service learning. Respondents from case study reflected on their own service learning implementation process and technology utilization throughout their service learning projects, which highlights constrains from current technologies for effective integration in service learning pedagogy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Experiential learning theory; ICT application; Service learning framework; Service learning pedagogy; Technology integration"

Based on the available massive geo-located human data, existing studies focused almost exclusively on the position attributes (i.e. coordinates) of the locations visited by people to explore the relationship, however, they ignored the category attributes (e.g. restaurant or supermarket) of these locations which imply the purposes (e.g. eating or shopping) behind human movements. A location with coordinates and category information is usually referred to as a point-of-interest (POI). In this paper, we study the relationship between POIs-related human mobility and socioeconomic status at city level. Starting from the location-based social network (i.e. Foursquare) dataset, we find that the check-in numbers of location categories are correlated with socioeconomic indicators, either positively or negatively. To further validate these correlations, we develop and test a multi-task prediction framework based on POIs-related human mobility for forecasting socioeconomic indicators. Extensive experiments on the Foursquare dataset show that the socioeconomic indicators can be well predicted by our proposed framework.

We conducted a 4 by 2 factorial online experiment (N = 621), featuring an HIV prevention video accompanied by a virality metric (i.e., high, medium, low, and no metric) and a video poster (i.e., demographic similarity versus dissimilarity). Results showed that virality metrics did not influence message evaluation. However, the presence of metrics decreased viewers’ perceived injunctive norms supporting condom use and HIV testing, which further decreased the corresponding behavioral intentions. The similarity between the viewer and the poster did not moderate the effects of virality metrics.

From the perspective of enterprises, different strategies of enterprise-generated content (EGC) have also been adapted as a response to unexpected UGC; however, few studies have investigated the influence of such strategies on the UGC propagation. This research examines which strategy on the negative UGC propagation is optimal by proposing an EGC-UGC interaction model. It aims to understand the interaction between UGC and EGC in the context of the social network. Using a simulation analysis method to measure the effect of such EGC factors as the first time of issuing EGC, the EGC quantity and the interactive frequency on UGC propagation, this study finds that interactive frequency is the key factor in defending against negative UGC propagation. This research further explores the effect of different strategy combinations referring to the aforementioned three factors on the two types of negative UGC propagation based on deviation distance. The results present two optimal strategies for the two types of negative UGC propagation. Overall, these findings offer some unique implications for UGC management and the information diffusion model of competitive, coexisting information. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Deviation distance; Enterprise-generated content; Strategy combination; User-generated content"

M-learning is not limited to time and place and it will make the desire of “equal education for all people around the world” comes true. Despite the advantages and opportunities that m-learning brings, it has not been implemented in developing countries (like Iran). The goal of this research is exploring the important factors affecting the acceptance of m-learning in Iran. These factors are divided into four macro groups: (1) Technological, (2) Pedagogical, (3) Social and (4) Individual issues. The purpose of this categorization is to discover the important factors affecting the acceptance of m-learning in both macro and micro scales. Because, it can help the developers to prioritize the issues in order to implement m-learning successfully in Iran. In this regard, a survey was conducted at one of the biggest and oldest universities of technology in Iran. The proposed model has been presented based on the combination of two models of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use Technology (UTAUT) and some other factors due to cultural and social structure of Iran. This model has been tested using the new approach called Partial Least Squares-Artificial Neural Network (PLS -ANN), which has the ability to analyze both linear and nonlinear relationships. The results demonstrate that the selection of mobile devices as an educational strategy is depended on the combination of pedagogical, technological, social and individual factors. These results show that perceived usefulness is the most effective factor in acceptance of m-learning in Iran. Also, due to the cultural and social structure of Iran, personal innovativeness has no impact on acceptance of m-learning. Moreover, pedagogical factors are effective on perceived usefulness as well as technological and individual factors are effective on perceived ease of use.

Distrust has been claimed as a major deterrent to an individual becoming a funder (Gerber and Hui, 2016); however, the literature lacks empirical evidence. This study aims to gain insight into the importance of distrust compared to trust by analyzing the influence of individuals’ trust and distrust in founders (as a group), and trust and distrust in the intermediary on individuals’ investment behavior. Furthermore, based on institutional trust theory, the authors propose a unique set of institutional protective mechanisms (platform rules, monitoring, and pledging security) and analyze how an individual's perception of each mechanism affects their trust and distrust in the founders and the intermediary. Additionally, building upon trust transference theory, the authors investigate whether trust or distrust in the intermediary affects an individual's trust or distrust in founders respectively.

A probability sample of 816 respondents in China was used in collecting data regarding the beliefs of their own and other's vulnerability to fraud online. Key findings show that their negative perceptions of mobile Internet fraud vary significantly by the strength of their social relationships and network homogeneity—the closer the ties, the greater perceived vulnerability to mobile Internet fraud; the more homogenous their social networks, the more pronounced the pattern. In addition, awareness of the fraud was found to enhance the self-other perceptual gap. Finally, the perceived negative impact of the fraud on self leads to protective actions in terms of verifying suspicious messages. On the other hand, the negatively perceived impact on weak ties is related to staying alert and reducing the use of mobile Internet, suggesting that respondents viewed fraud victims in their social network as warnings. © 2019","Internet fraud; Mobile Internet; Protective action; Social networks; Third-person effects"

Many studies include these approaches in different research areas: from research in healthcare to mobile environments, robotics, etc. Interaction is seen as a critical concept, and the work for its improvement is a crucial factor for many platforms, systems, and business domains. The goal of this manuscript is to present a systematic review of the literature to identify, analyze and classify the published approaches to support or enhance Human-Computer Interaction or Human-Machine Interaction from the perspective of software architectures. The method followed is the systematic review following the guidelines related to Systematic Literature Reviews methods such as the one proposed by Kitchenham and other authors in the field of software engineering. As results, this study identified 39 papers that included software architectures to improve or analyze Human-Computer Interaction or Human-Machine Interaction. Three main approaches were found on software architectures: layered architectures, modular architectures, and architectures based on software agents, but they lacked standardization and were mainly ad-hoc solutions. The primary interfaces covered were those related to Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and multimodal/natural ones. The primary application domain detected were in multimodal systems. The main purpose of most of the papers was to support multimodal interaction. Some conclusions achieved are that the generic solutions to support or analyze HCI/HMI processes are still rare in the literature. Despite many works dealing with this topic and its issues and challenges, it is necessary to keep on improving the research in this area through the application of standard techniques and solutions, exploring new ways of analyzing and interpreting interaction, escaping from ad-hoc solutions or evaluating the solutions proposed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Human-Computer Interaction; Human-Machine Interaction; Software Architectures; Systematic Literature Review"

Hence, utilizing the “Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL)” technique, the current study investigated the clinical importance of social media addiction from the perspective of researchers and psychotherapists. Accordingly, by reviewing the literature 15 distal predictors of social media addiction were extracted and further classified into three groups of personality factors, comorbid symptoms, and psychosocial factors. From the data collected from 35 respondents, the results highlighted the group of personality factors as the most important dimension increasing the risk for developing social media addiction from the respondents’ perspective. Moreover, the DEMATEL results revealed the predictors of openness to experience (personality dimension), loneliness (psychosocial), and depression (comorbid) as the most important predictors of social media addiction within each group.

However, various challenges hinder the adoption of this technology, especially in educational institutions. This paper explores the factors that information technology (IT) leaders consider to be impeding the adoption of cloud-computing in institutions of higher learning in Kenya. A quantitative investigation using an online questionnaire was used to conduct this study in the 69 accredited universities and colleges in Kenya. The study findings were statistically analyzed to rank the level of influence of the factors that under investigation. The key factors identified as hindering the adoption of cloud computing include concerns about the reliability of Cloud Service providers and lack of skills in cloud computing. Also, there are concerns about inadequate support and training from Cloud Service providers and government policies on cloud computing, data security and confidentiality. Role based training for Cloud services users, proactive management of Cloud services and implementation of information systems governance policies are recommended to address these concerns. These recommendations have been discussed and consolidated into a framework for adoption of cloud computing that can also be applied by educational institutions in other developing countries to assist the key stakeholders in guiding their decision-making process on adoption of cloud computing. Although the study is limited to accredited universities and colleges in Kenya, it comes at a convenient time when the Kenyan government is launching e-learning in all public primary schools. There is however not much research that had been done especially on cloud computing in Kenyan educational institutions. This study, therefore, adds new insights on what needs to be considered and addressed to facilitate the adoption of cloud computing in institutions of higher education. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",""

However, little research has been done on how party preference is related to politically active social media use. We begin with a consideration of how political participation on social media has evolved between various socio-economic and demographic groups in advanced information societies and especially in Finland. In our empirical analysis we examine the general use of social media as well as its use for political purposes with the aid of a nationally representative dataset, collected in 2017–2018 from 3724 Finnish citizens. We argue that there are notable differences between parties when examining their supporters’ social media use for political purposes. The differences are related to the digital divides and political extremes. The results confirmed the idea that new political movements made up of younger and more educated supporters have been successful by leveraging social media. The study also revealed that the ideological gap between party supporters is greater in social media especially when examining new kinds of politics based on cultural questions, identity issues, and post-materialist values. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Finland; Participation; Party supporters; Political values; Social media"

In the virtual environment, participants (N = 190) navigated down a polluted river that was described as geographically and temporally close or distant. The affordance of interactivity, specifically contingency, was also manipulated. Results revealed that feeling psychologically close to the environment led to greater risk perception, which in turn led to more environmental behavior and greater support for environmental policy in the days following the experiment. In terms of interactivity, higher perceptions of contingency led to greater self-efficacy, which also led to more environmental behavior and greater support for environmental policy after the experiment.

Considering education management information systems (EMIS) capacities to collect, analyse, process and publish information and data, it is easy to perceive their relevance to both education organizations and students. Nevertheless, and despite EMIS complexity and inherent possibilities, the existing literature does not provide for a detailed characterization on the impact these systems might have on students’ success. Thus, this research focuses on understanding the use of EMIS by students and the arising of net benefits; it introduces an EMIS success model which posits that to ensure net benefits for students, education institutions must safeguard that their education management information systems are of high quality, while at the same time students are maintained satisfied with the system and engage in continuous use. To assess the posed model, an empirical study has been performed, involving students from higher education institutions. Findings from the study allow us to perceive that, as information systems (IS) success models state, EMIS use and students’ satisfaction are predictors of net benefits. This same model also claims that the available information quality and EMIS inherent service quality are also strong determinants of both continuous EMIS use and student satisfaction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","EMIS; Higher education level; IS success; Students’ performance"

The growing ubiquity of Web access, and the variety of devices that allow us to interact with it, have made it possible for learners to choose the tools and services that better adapt to their needs, providing a means of personalizing the learning experience. In this paper, we report the results of research on learner-created Personal Learning Environments (PLEs) based on Web 2.0 services, in the context of higher education, as both a means of transforming learning and teaching processes, and as preparation for the learners’ future professional lives in a dynamic environment with a heavy digital and technological influence. The methodology used was Design-Based Research, by carrying out an intervention in practice settings in a subject at higher education level; this intervention and its successive iterations allowed for a continuous process of data collection and analysis, which was in turn used to modify and create new interventions. The original pilot test and successive iterations ran from 2009 to 2012, with a second round of data collection carried out between 2014 and 2016. The analysis of the data provided evidence of PLEs as tools for learning and acquiring skills, strengthening social interactions, and improvement in the organization and management of content and learning resources; it also helped identify obstacles and barriers, and possible solutions. The main outcome of this research is presented as a set of guidelines for using PLEs as tools for supporting formal learning, either by teachers or by the learners themselves. © 2018 The Authors","Digital transformation; Higher education; Learning technologies; Personal Learning Environments (PLE); TEL; Web 2.0"

It is therefore important to be able to predict the users who may be at a greater risk of experiencing negative consequences as a result of their use. Instagram is an immersive platform and peoples’ behaviour on Instagram can be important to their self-concept and self-esteem; users are potentially deeply emotionally invested in their Instagram use. This paper presents three studies investigating an Instagram-specific form of emotional investment – Instagram Investment. Study 1 (N = 167) examined Instagram Investment as a predictor of depression, anxiety, and stress, within a series of hierarchical multiple regression models, and demonstrated the potential utility of Instagram Investment for the prediction of depression and stress. In Study 2 (N = 120) we expanded our understanding of Instagram Investment within the context of self-esteem. A mediation model revealed an indirect effect of number of followers on self-esteem via Instagram Investment. Finally, in Study 3 (N = 259) we examined the structural properties of the 6 items used to measure Instagram Investment using a confirmatory factor analysis. Together, these studies demonstrate that Instagram Investment is a new and valuable construct for explaining the way that individuals are impacted by their use of Instagram. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Emotional investment; Instagram Investment; Self-esteem; Social comparison; Social media anxiety"

This holds in particular for MS delivery over cellular mobile communication infrastructures. However, most prior research on MS service proliferation did not focus on mobile music streaming (MMS). MMS differs from MS consumption over fixed networks, among others, in terms of use contexts, devices and pricing schedules. Instead, earlier work typically explored perceptual and socio-demographic differences between (self-reported) non-users and users of MS services in general. Therefore, this study extends the literature by exploring differences between non-users and three distinct groups of users (new, seasoned, lost) of MMS services with regard to socio-demographic, device, contract and service utilization characteristics. The empirical analysis draws on non-perceptual profile data of 3228 mobile network operator (MNO) subscribers residing in Germany. Mean comparisons and discriminant analysis show that non-users are about 10 to 15 years older, live in non-urban areas, are equipped with a less modern smartphone, were not addressed with a special MMS promotion campaign and have a much lower data allowance in their rate plan than the various user groups. Within the MMS user groups, new adopters have more modern devices, are in rate plans with higher metered allowances (excluding MMS data consumption) and exploit their data allowance to a larger degree. Lost MMS users are more likely to be older females who were not eligible for a special promotion offer and have a lower data allowance. Implications of the findings are discussed for MNOs striving to promote sustainable MMS use and for future research in the field of innovative digital media and communication services. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Mobile communication; Mobile music streaming; Service adoption; Service termination; User profiles; Zero-rating plans"

We examine a distinct aspect of sharing behavior on social media, namely how others’ self-presentation influences visitor's subjective well-being. To this end, the present research examined: (1) whether others’ self-presentation affects individuals’ subjective well-being, and (2) how others’ self-presentation affects individuals’ subjective well-being. Two laboratory experiments were conducted to research these questions. Study 1 (N = 100) found that compared to non-self-presentation, others’ self-presentation predicts a lower subjective well-being. The findings answered question 1. Apart from the conclusion of Study 1, to address question 2, Study 2 (N = 153) examined the moderated mediation effect using relative deprivation as mediator and general self-efficacy as moderator to answer question 2. We found that others’ self-presentation on social media could increase individuals’ feeling of relative deprivation and decrease their subjective well-being through upward social comparison, and the mediation effect was moderated by general self-efficacy.

The adoption of digital learning device such as e-books amongst Korean students is accelerated by its nation-wide high mobile connectivity. When children adopt such new technology, parents are often the buyers, while the children are the actual users. To date, within the technology adoption literature, little is known about where buyers and users are different entities, and even less is known within the context of family. By filling this gap, the purpose of this research is to examine the parents’ perceived notion of their child's propensity to accept a new product. By extending the technology acceptance model (TAM), we considered two additional factors: perceived playfulness and risk. Results show that unlike in traditional TAM research, when buyers are not the users of the new product, the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use differently influence attitude formation.

However, the excessive use of these apps can be addictive for certain individuals. This paper combined the socio-technical approach and attachment theory to build a holistic framework to study the factors that affected addiction to short-form video apps. In this study, 388 valid questionnaires were collected to test the hypotheses. Results corroborated that social interaction anxiety and social isolation were positively related to interpersonal attachment and that personalization and entertainment were positively related to site attachment. Interpersonal and site attachments had significant positive influences on short-form video app addiction. Moreover, neuroticism positively moderated the influence of social interaction anxiety on interpersonal attachment and positively moderated the influence of personalization on site attachment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Addiction; Attachment theory; Short-form video application; Socio-technical approach"

Seven scientific databases were searched, comprising 55 relevant studies in 52 publications out of 975 publications. Results were mixed: Both self-presentation and lurking can enhance or diminish well-being and body image. Self-presentation, lurking, and well-being were categorized to systematically clarify results, and vital mechanisms were determined to explain differences within and between self-presentation and lurking. For example, lurking at others generally decreased well-being, whereas authentic self-presentation increased well-being.

Whereas there is extensive and evolving interest in mobile social networking in cohesive societies that have stable normal living conditions, comparatively little research exists on harnessing mobile social networking to foster participation in crisis management. Far less attention has been focused on investigating the motivations and determinants to continue the use of mobile social networking in humanitarian crises that have arisen out of civil wars. Therefore, using the Syrian crisis as a case study, the purpose of this study is to investigate the motivations and determinants to continue the use of mobile social networking to participate in crisis management in civil war-torn societies. An online questionnaire was used to collect data from Syrians who have remained in Syria. Smart PLS was used to analyze the data. The results indicated that mobile social networking plays a significant role in the fulfillment of basic humanitarian needs, including survival, safety, a sense of community, freedom of speech and expression, pressures for peace, cognitive motivations and self-actualization. In addition, the results indicated that users of mobile social networking encounter a wide range of risks on the individual and societal levels, including direct personal threats, the penetration of terrorism ideology, the incitement of violence, and the advocacy of hatred. The present study sheds light on the critical role of mobile social networking in providing an opportunity for the participation of society's members in the crisis management.

The results show that off-site tweets were more negative than on-site tweets, especially during the disaster. As for retweet patterns, indifferent-neutral and positive tweets spread broader than mixed-neutral and negative tweets. However, negative tweets spread faster than positive tweets, which reveals that social media users were more sensitive to negative information in disaster situations. With the development of the disaster, social media users were more sensitive to on-site positive messages than off-site negative posts.

Earlier research into the privacy paradox has a number of caveats. Most studies focus on intentions rather than behavior and the influence of technical knowledge, privacy awareness, and financial resources is not systematically ruled out. This study therefore tests the privacy paradox under extreme circumstances, focusing on actual behavior and eliminating the effects of a lack of technical knowledge, privacy awareness, and financial resources. We designed an experiment on the downloading and usage of a mobile phone app among technically savvy students, giving them sufficient money to buy a paid-for app. Results suggest that neither technical knowledge and privacy awareness nor financial considerations affect the paradoxical behavior observed in users in general. Technically-skilled and financially independent users risked potential privacy intrusions despite their awareness of potential risks. In their considerations for selecting and downloading an app, privacy aspects did not play a significant role; functionality, app design, and costs appeared to outweigh privacy concerns. © 2019 The Authors","Apps; Mobile phones; Privacy intrusion; Privacy paradox; Privacy valuation"

Meanwhile, other researchers pointed out higher addiction among Spanish teenage female. Little studies in the Spanish context have analyzed the different socio-cultural and biological factors possibly related to this addiction and gender differences. With all being said, this study focused on determining the current incidence of social networks addiction in young college students, relating this social networking addiction with loneliness, prenatal testosterone (2D:4D ratio), self-esteem and personal satisfaction. A cross-sectional study focused on female and male college students aged 17–25 years (N = 278) was carried out.

Using the data from a national survey, this study conducted a latent class analysis and identified four distinct profiles of U.S. urban residents’ (N = 474) risk beliefs about drone delivery. Drawing from research on belief formation and change, the study further found that attitudes toward drone delivery, perceived innovativeness of an organization due to drone adoptions, and expectancy predicted the audience profiles, but perceived behavioral control did not.

Drawing on the cognitive and strategic aspects of anonymity from SIDE, this study conducted a 2 (anonymity) × 4 (bystander number) factorial experiment that simulated an online cyberbullying scenario and examined bystanders’ intentions toward four different intervention behaviors that ranged from passive attention to active confrontation. The findings indicated that anonymity should be integrated as an essential feature in examining bystander effect in CMC. Also, the number of bystanders and online anonymity do not affect people's intentions to intervene in a passive or non-confrontational manner. Instead, anonymity and the number of bystanders affected people's intentions to engage in direct interventions, such as confronting the bullies. The relationship between the number of bystanders and people's intentions to intervene was not a linear relationship. Initially, intentions to intervene increased with bystander numbers but dropped off after a critical point. By including varying levels of bystander numbers and varying degrees of intervention behaviors, this study suggested that bystander decisions depend on people's combined consideration of anonymity, bystander numbers, and intervention behaviors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anonymity; Bystander effects; Bystander numbers; Diffusion of responsibility; SIDE theory"

The data came from a survey of 769 students from eight public universities in Hong Kong at the height of the Umbrella Movement. The findings revealed that acquisition of political information from social media and alternative media is associated with social movement participation through different mechanisms.

Digital development is understood as the level of access to and use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in households and by individuals. This study has been undertaken using the following methodology: 1) factor analysis to identify the key variables of use of and access to ICTs in households and by individuals in European regions on the basis of data provided by Eurostat; 2) construction of a synthetic index, the household and individual digital development index (HIDDI) on the basis of identified factors; 3) analysis of the spatial autocorrelation of digital development to identify, delimit and quantify spatial patterns and clusters in European regions. The results of this study lead to the conclusion that the digital development of households and individuals in European regions is founded on broadband Internet access. In this context, the level of digital development and the DD of European regions is based on households and individuals’ daily use of e-commerce, e-banking and e-government services. However, the use of social networks in households with broadband shows less DD in Europe. The values obtained by using the HIDDI for each European region reveal that the maximum DD between these is 37%, with the spatial autocorrelation analysis identifying a NW-SE pattern in Europe. Thus, a region's level of digital development is directly related to that of its neighbours; and geographical proximity/vicinity is an element to take into account when analysing the disparities of the DD. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Complex index; ICTs; NUTs 2 region; Regional spatial pattern; Spatial clusters"

It is well known that in the absence of regulatory mitigation the population density has a positive effect on broadband diffusion. Hence, we measure the effect of the population density on the determinants of broadband diffusion throughout the postal codes of Finland via Geographically Weighted Regression. We suggest that the main determinants of broadband diffusion and the population density follow a spatial pattern that is either concentric with a weak/medium/strong strength or non-concentric convex/concave. Based on 10 patterns, we argue that the Finnish spectrum policy encouraged Mobile Network Operators to satisfy ambitious Universal Service Obligations without the need for a Universal Service Fund. Spectrum auctions facilitated infrastructure-based competition via equitable spectrum allocation and coverage obligation delivery via low-fee licenses. However, state subsidies for fiber deployment did not attract investment from nationwide operators due to mobile preference. These subsidies encouraged demand-driven investment, leading to the emergence of fiber consumer cooperatives. To explain this emergence, we show that when population density decreases, the level of mobile service quality decreases and community commitment increases. Hence, we recommend regulators implementing market-driven strategies for 5G to stimulate local investment. For example, by allocating the 3.5 GHz and higher bands partly through local light licensing. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Broadband diffusion; Broadband regulation; Community operators; Finland; Population density; Spatial analysis"

Based on each concept's predictors, we conducted a pilot study of items that are likely to influence FIS and then administered an online survey. According to the results, we extracted four promoting factors (the need for recognition, perceived value of FIS, affection for creators, vulnerability to creators’ inducement) and three hindering factors (perceived subjective norms, perceived inconvenience in payment, perceived lack of affordability). Among them, perceived value of FIS, affection for creators, and vulnerability to creators’ inducements positively affect the intention to sponsor continuously, despite the negative effect of perceived subjective norms. Vulnerability to creators’ inducements were the only variable that influenced the amount of sponsorship. The cases of affection to creators and the intention to sponsor continuously revealed the moderating effect of time spent on live-streaming content. We discuss the implications of the results for the field of contents creation and the related subjects. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","AfreecaTV; Content creators; Fan's instant sponsorship; Live streaming content; Payment; Personal broadcasting; YouTube"

The technology has been around for sometimes, but its prevalence is not yet widespread, and thus the potentials have largely been underestimated. The purpose of this paper is to develop a comprehensive model that can explain a large percentage of variance in the intention to use smart home technology. To do so, this paper, based on technology acceptance model, diffusion of innovation theory and consumer perceived innovativeness, proposes an integrated model and validates it through Structural Equation Modelling on data collected from 156 respondents. The results reveal that compatibility, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are important determinants affecting the adoption of smart home technology. Moreover, trialability while show no direct effect on the intention to use, its affect is realized indirectly via constructs of PU and PEoU. The SEM results also show that the perceived cost negatively impacts the intention to use. This paper is one of the first empirical attempt that includes consumer perceived innovativeness in the model. This paper contributes to the literature of IoT, in particular to smart home technology research.

This kind of games combines the virtual world with the real world to generate extensions of reality in terms of time, space and social interaction. These extensions have involved users in experiences as varied as those exposed by augmented reality and the location of the player or mixed reality scenarios. In the educational context, games have been integrated little by little into learning processes. Specifically, PG have shown to have a higher level of immersion in people's daily activities. Therefore, a greater impact is generated when integrating the technologies of the PG and the narrative of a story that is told through the gaming experience. In order to explore some fields, we focus the study on the narrative and geolocation applied to close spaces, it is a way of giving an enriched experience to the player through a digital transformation perspective. For this reason, it is necessary to have a platform that allows the creation and edition of PG based on narrative to increase the motivation of higher education students. This article describes the creation of a platform that integrates tools for creating stories and editing narrative content in the game experiences. The main objective is focused on increasing the motivation of students in educational processes. Specifically, the platform allows the creation of pervasive gaming experiences in closed spaces on university campuses. In addition, the results of a test case developed with the platform and its validation through statistical tools and gameplay metrics are exposed, thus demonstrating the increase in students’ motivation through the use of PG. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Digital transformation; Learning motivation; Narrative; Pervasive game"

However, few studies have empirically examined whether temporal self-boosting rating manipulation changes the follow-up dynamic pattern of online ratings. This study empirically identifies manipulated ratings and examines how this manipulation influences the evolution of follow-up ratings over time. Rating records of more than 30,000 restaurants are extracted from the server log of a restaurant review website. The results show a statistically nonsignificant difference in the average rating scores between before and after manipulation, indicating that manipulation does not influence follow-up rating dynamics. Moreover, the difference in average ratings between before and after manipulation decreases within a long time window, which indicates that the long-term effect is weaker than the short-term one. The results are further validated by an online field experiment. We then construct a simulation model to reveal the underlying mechanisms of why the follow-up raters could correct the bias of rating manipulation. The manipulated high-rating score of the vendor will increase the diversity of consumers’ individual preferences, which leads to diverse evaluations among users. The aggregation of online ranking by taking the average score of ratings helps form a decentralized climate of opinion and finally helps correct the biased rating. This study challenges the common belief that self-boosting misinformation affects the performance of online commerce. The nonsignificant effect of rating manipulation on rating dynamics echoes the theory of the wisdom of crowds. Furthermore, this study has managerial implications for both online vendors and online rating platforms. We suggested that the system should degrade social influences among users in order to reduce the possible impacts by manipulated ratings. © 2019","Moving average; Rating dynamics; Rating manipulation; Wisdom of crowds"

This study examines motivational mechanisms underlying the use of Facebook Reactions, which is a successful example of nuanced social feedback systems. By integrating the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Uses and Gratification Theory (U&G) into a single framework, the study introduces a structural model that expands the notion of ‘perceived usefulness’ as a multifaceted concept reflective of different utilities of nuanced feedback systems. A survey was conducted in a large U.S. public university (N = 422), finding that social cognitive factors, as operationalized in TAM, affect perceived usefulness for different utilities. However, social cognitive factors had only indirect effects on increasing the use intention, mediated by hedonic and expressive usefulness. Despite occurring in an instant, clicking a social button is a mindful behavior.

Psychological needs satisfaction demonstrates different effectiveness on learning engagement. Specifically, competence need satisfaction is shown to be the strongest predictor of MOOC learning engagement, while autonomy need satisfaction has the weakest effectiveness. Further, the results demonstrate that peer learning group identification strengthens the effect of social interaction on psychological needs satisfaction.

This study presents a gamification proposition that aims to promote engagement in the user's treatment with the use of health-related systems. Seven stages compose the method: inspection of system requirements and its functionalities; mapping of the target audience characteristics; identification of interaction flows; gamification analysis applied in similar systems; selection of gamification elements; development; and evaluation. To validate the method, we developed two versions of an m-Health application, one with the game elements and one without these elements. In the evaluation stage, 14 patients with hypertension were divided into four groups to verify if the inclusion of game elements would promote greater engagement in health care. Data collection included engagement questionnaire, technology acceptance questionnaire, system logs, and participants’ feedback. Results showed gamification favored the engagement, stimulating intrinsic motivation in the participants.

It appraises symbolic interactionist insights to consider the ways in which contextual factors and worldview may help to illuminate officers’ narratives of cybercriminals and the interpretations and implications of such accounts. Semi-structured interviews of forty frontline EFCC officers formed the empirical basis of this study and were subjected to a directed approach of qualitative content analysis. While prior studies, for example, indicated that only a group of cybercriminals deploy spiritual and magical powers to defraud victims (i.e. modus operandi), our data analysis extended this classification into more refined levels involving multiple features. In particular, analysis bifurcates cybercriminals and their operations based on three factors: educational-attainment, modus-operandi, and networks-collaborators. Results also suggest that these cybercriminals and their operations are embedded in “masculinity-and-material-wealth”. These contributions thus have implications for a range of generally accepted viewpoints about these cybercriminals previously taken-for-granted. Since these criminals have victims all over the world, insights from our study may help various local and international agencies [a]to understand the actions/features of these two groups of cybercriminals better and develop more effective response strategies.

Drawing on theories of gratifications, task-technology fit, and media dependency, we develop an integrative research model to understand Gen Yers’ mobile social media use intention in emergencies. Based on survey data from 424 Gen Y users in China, we conduct a structural equation modeling analysis and an artificial neural network analysis to validate the model. On one hand, social media dependency has a significant and positive effect on gratifications users seek during emergencies. Each gratification positively influences use intention except for information sharing. In order of the effects on use intention, communication is the most important, followed by solitary play and information seeking. On the other hand, both perceived mobility and task features positively influence perceived task-technology fit, which in turn exerts a significant effect on mobile social media use intention. The findings provide a fine-grained understanding of the relative importance of key predictors of mobile social media use intention in emergencies.

Using a huge amount of text data from a Chinese online petition forum started in 2008, we explored the citizens’ discursive strategies to express their demands and examined the effect of political discourses on government response. From the perspective of self-identity, we identified three separate discourses: individualism, relational collectivism, and group collectivism. In general, nowadays Chinese citizens prefer the discourse of relational collectivism, and the governments are more likely to respond to demands reflecting relational collectivism. We also distinguished the way of opinions expression with paternalistic discourse and legalistic discourse. Although more citizens justify their demands with legalistic discourse, the governments are more likely to respond to expressions reflecting paternalism. We found that Chinese citizens strategically express their demands by employing different political discourses, such as the discourses of relational collectivism and paternalism, whereas the government's selective response implies that the discursive strategy may fulfill citizens’ interest to some extent. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Discursive strategy; Opinion expression; Political discourse; Selective response"

We make first strides toward bridging this gap by leveraging theories of interpersonal relationships (social exchange, leader-member exchange and interpersonal trust theories) to suggest that two types of guanxi, supervisor-subordinate guanxi and peer guanxi, can influence the translation of IT use for work into work-family conflict. Data from 485 employees in Chinese firms support most of our hypotheses, and show that: (1) IT use for work increases work-family conflict, (2) Peer guanxi reduces it, (3) supervisor-subordinate guanxi augments the effect of IT use for work on work-family conflict, and (4) there are gender differences in guanxi effects (for women, the effect of IT use for work on work-family conflict is consistent at different levels of supervisor-subordinate guanxi; for men this effect is augmented in high supervisor-subordinate guanxi conditions). Ultimately, the findings extend and provide a unique integration of old and new traditions in Chinese firms. The IT literature is extended by showing how guanxi can influence the translation of IT use for work into negative outcomes in the family domain.

In 2017, the German Bundestag passed a new law, the Network Enforcement Act (NetzDG), which requires website owners to review the content published on their pages upon it being reported by users and to remove it as soon as possible in the event of a breach of the law. This forces social media operators to establish efficient reporting systems which can create breeding grounds for user denunciation. To get an overview of whether this is really the case, we briefly discuss state surveillance and denunciation and analyse the statistics of content blockings and deletions in five countries (USA, Germany, United Kingdom, Russia and Turkey). In Germany the number of blockings and deletions of content has risen for Facebook, Twitter and YouTube due to the NetzDG, but it has also been found that the majority of reports were unjustified as they did not lead to any restriction or deletion of the content. When comparing the German numbers with those of the other countries investigated, it becomes apparent that after the introduction of the NetzDG in Germany, more content is being blocked and deleted. Also, a comparison of the various laws regulating online content in these countries was conducted. It was found that not only Germany has tightened the regulation of online content and that other countries are also trying to transform the Internet into a more hate free environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Denunciation; Freedom of speech; History of surveillance; Internet law; Network enforcement act; Netzdg; Privatization of case law; Social media"

We employed a two-wave panel survey (NT2 = 461) using a quota sample of adults. Results revealed that Facebook use predicted upward social comparison, which harmed individuals’ self-esteem and well-being over time, while Instagram use directly influenced well-being negatively over time. Additionally, we found support for reciprocal relationships between upward social comparison on SNSs and self-esteem as well as well-being in a longitudinal context. The potential negative implications of SNS use on well-being are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Self-esteem; Social comparison; Social networking sites; Well-being"

Evidence, however, suggests that reporting is scarce. This research examined why this is the case. To this end, Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) was used to examine the influence of the triadic factors of perceived self-efficacy toward antiphishing behaviors, expected negative outcomes from reporting spear phishing emails, and cyber security self-monitoring, on individuals’ likelihood of reporting spear phishing emails. Based on recent research on phishing victims, the present study also incorporated cyber risk beliefs (CRBs) into the SCT framework. The model, tested using survey data (N = 386), revealed that the likelihood of reporting spear phishing emails is increased by perceived self-efficacy, expected negative outcomes, and cyber security self-monitoring. Furthermore, the CRBs directly influenced the three SCT factors and indirectly the individuals’ likelihood of reporting spear phishing emails. The findings add to our understanding of SCT and the science of cyber security. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cyber risk beliefs; Negative outcomes; Self-efficacy; Self-monitoring; Spear phishing emails"

Drawing on motivational factors related to social distance and applying Cognitive Transactional Theory as a theoretical lens, our empirical analysis is based on 657 broadcasters on the market-leading social live streaming platforms in China. This study reached the following findings: Users’ social distance from SMIs is positively related to their broadcast intention. Challenge stressors and hindrance stressors have different mediating effects between social distance and broadcast intention. Challenge stressors positively mediate the relationship between social distance and broadcast intention, and hindrance stressors negatively mediate the relationship between these two variables. Users’ material values moderate the relationship between hindrance stressors and broadcast intention. These conclusions extend the understanding of the theoretical motivation behind the booming phenomenon of ‘SMIs’ and can help platform managers to motivate users’ continued participation on these platforms. © 2019","Challenge stressors; Hindrance stressors; Material values; Social distance; Social media influencer"

However, in the workplace they can also act as invisible barriers for the interaction between individuals from different hierarchical levels, thus impeding the exchange of information and knowledge. This effect is particularly assumed to be true for country cultures with high power distance characteristics. Based on a Skype for Business dataset with over 22,000 users and over 8 million conversations from six countries, we test the potential impact of country culture for cross-hierarchical communication. Finally, we aggregate the data of all countries and provide insights into specific communication patterns for each hierarchical level across the organization. In this context, we also compare the effect of formal attributes (e.g. hierarchy level) and informal attributes (activity level) on response behavior. In this article, insightful findings are outlined, such as the insignificance of country cultural factors, the essential focus on the middle levels of hierarchy and the influence of staff responsibility on the vertical access to information and knowledge.

An online questionnaire was developed and distributed on popular websites to collect data, and 1028 usable responses are collected from the players of Pokémon Go in Taiwan. The eleven hypotheses and control variables were validated by using structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques. Among the antecedents of the game's stickiness in the model, the flow and satisfaction were found to have strong direct effects. The effects of control variables (age, gender, platform, game experience, and in-app expense) on the stickiness were significant as well. Moreover, telepresence, challenge, perceived control, curiosity, and concentration all have direct influences on the flow. Only perceived currency and responsiveness were found to have a direct impact on players’ satisfaction.

We focus on investigating the effects of the various types of perceived risks and individuals’ propensities on the overall risk perception of the IoT services and explore some demographic variables. The perceived risks include perceived financial risk, perceived performance risk, perceived security/privacy risk, and perceived electromagnetic radiation (EMR) risk. The individuals’ propensities include the sensitivity to electricity price changes, environmental destruction, and new technology acceptance. As a result, this study confirms the existence of various influencing factors in the risk perception of the IoT-based home energy management services. Perceived EMR risk is the most influential one among the various types of perceived risks of the services, followed by perceived performance risk and perceived security/privacy risk. In general, experts point out cybersecurity threats as a weakness of ICT services, but users are more likely to have fear of the EMR. Moreover, sensitivity to electricity price changes and sensitivity to new technology acceptance are significant factors. This study has a significance in that we explore various factors affecting the risk perception of IoT services in the energy management sector in detail and comprehensively.

As a solution, cloud computing services can offer an alternative, low-cost, and reliable way to store, manage, and retrieve health-related data, as well as monitoring patients’ health conditions anywhere and anytime using any device with any platform. The migration to cloud services is not yet widespread in Iraqi health facilities due to various challenges, including security and privacy, legal policies, and implementation. For instance, there has been no research shedding light on the utilization of cloud computing services in Iraqi hospitals’ health information systems. This study proposed a model by defining the critical success factors influencing physicians’ confirmation and behavioral control toward utilizing cloud health information systems in Iraqi hospitals. The model's variables were statistically investigated by utilizing an online questionnaire. Data were collected from a probability sample of 259 physicians working in four Iraqi high-IT hospitals. The collected ordinal data were analyzed using the PLS-SEM approach as a nonparametric second-generation multivariate analysis. The results showed that the effects of system compatibility, system complexity, security, and privacy on physicians’ confirmation and behavioral control were statistically significant. Both confirmation and behavioral control had a positive effect on physicians’ utilization of the technology in the Iraqi hospitals. It is believed that such finding may help to aid the current understanding of cloud health systems in managing health data as well as providing the necessary recommendations for policy makers to direct healthcare professionals to continuously consider the use of modern information and communications technology in the workplace. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cloud computing; e-Health; Health informatics; Health information system; Iraq; Model"

However, software applications sometimes collect users’ data without their knowledge. When applications collect and use users’ data without transparency, this leads to user privacy invasions because users do not expect the application to collect and use these information. Therefore, it is important that software developers understand users’ privacy expectations when designing applications in order to handle user data transparently in software applications. However, due to the lack of systematic approaches to extract user privacy requirements, developers end up designing applications either based on their assumptions on user privacy expectations, or relating to their own expectations of privacy as a user. Nevertheless, how accurate these perceived privacy expectations are against actual user expectations is not currently known. This research focuses on investigating developers’ privacy expectations from a user point of view against users’ privacy expectations. We also investigate developers’ assumptions on user privacy expectations against actual user privacy expectations. Our findings revealed that developers’ assumptions on user privacy expectations are close to their own expectations of privacy from a user point of view and that developers’ privacy expectations from a user point of view are significantly different from actual user privacy expectations. With this understanding, we provide recommendations for software developers to understand and acknowledge user expectations on privacy when they design and develop applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Designing privacy; Software developers; Software development; Usable privacy; User privacy expectations"

Influential nodes are not pre-defined and need to be identified to better understand and control the network. Trust of the nodes can be an important indicator of their influence and trusted nodes can also affect other nodes. However, analysis of trust and influence relationship in social network communities needs investigation. This study proposes a SNTrust model to find the trust of nodes in a network using a local and global trust and also investigates trust, influence and their relationship in SN communities. Different SN-based influence evaluation approaches named K-core, closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and page rank is used to find influential nodes. We have explored the trust and influence of nodes in their communities as well as in the network. Different standard datasets such as Consulting Company dataset, Freeman EIES dataset, Blogcatalogue dataset, and Facebook groups dataset are used for experimentation and Pearson's correlation and level of significance (p-value) are used for results evaluation. We found a positive linear correlation between the local trust of a node and its influence. It is found that the nodes which are trusted in the network are highly trusted in their communities. There is a strong linear relationship between the influence of a node in the network and community. Furthermore, it is also observed that nodes that are close to each other in a community have high trust among them. The results show that the proposed SNTrust model performed better in finding trust, influence and their correlation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Community; Influence; Social network; Trust"

The regression analysis results are based on 161 respondents who adopted ESM in the workplace, and are used to examine the impact of task and relationship conflict on employee agility. The results show that relationship conflict has a U-shaped curvilinear relationship with employee agility. Conversely, the association between task conflict and employee agility is has an inverted U-shaped relationship. Moreover, the link between task conflict and employee agility is moderated by ESM usage, such that the curvilinear relationship is weakened by ESM usage. This study contributes to extant ESM literature by investigating workplace conflict and its role in developing employee agility in ESM environments.

This study surveyed 1162 small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in Lagos in an effort to understand how SMEs in developing country contexts use mobile apps to enhance their businesses through DCs. Through the use of the covariance-based structural equation modelling (SEM) technique, the study explored the fitness of a conceptual formative model for SMEs. The model assembled 7 latent variables namely: mobile app usage, adaptive capability, absorptive capability, innovative capability, opportunity sensing ability, opportunity shaping ability and opportunity seizing ability. Subsequently, 15 hypotheses aimed at testing the relationships between the latent variables were developed and tested. The findings revealed that mobile app usage increases the adaptive, absorptive and innovative capabilities of SMEs. Absorptive capabilities help SMEs to maximise opportunities, while innovative capabilities negatively influence SMEs’ tendency to maximise opportunities. The results failed to establish a direct relationship between mobile app usage and SMEs’ ability to maximise opportunities. The research outcomes indicate that SMEs in Lagos respond to opportunities innovatively but they seldom exhibit innovation in order to create opportunities. The heterogeneous nature of SMEs complicates any clear-cut narrative as to how SMEs in Lagos should employ mobile apps to create and maximise opportunities. However, mobile apps could induce innovation and, as such, impact significantly when developed and applied to the contextual requirements of SMEs.

In Cameroon, all the top e-commerce giants have deployed smartphone applications to facilitate m-commerce activities. However, little is known about the factors that influence m-commerce adoption in the country. As such, this study had as objective to determine the key factors that influence consumer's adoption of m-commerce applications in Cameroon. Using data from 372 respondents, a modified version of the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) was validated in the Cameroon context. The findings showed that social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivations, perceived risk and perceived trust were significant predictors of the behavioural intention to adopt m-commerce applications. Also, the results showed that consumers who had a high intention to adopt m-commerce were more likely to recommend the technology to others. For researchers, the study depicts the relevance of extending existing technology acceptance models like the UTUAT2 with appropriate factors in different technological and geographical context. For practitioners, the study identifies customer-specific and environmental factors that m-commerce providers in Cameroon and other regions with similar characteristics could consider when designing and implementing strategies for attracting consumers to use their m-commerce applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cameroon; M-commerce; Perceived risk; Perceived trust; UTAUT2"

It is therefore essential that wireless connectivity can be delivered in a cost-efficient way by Mobile Network Operators, for the benefit of all digital ecosystem actors. The contribution of this paper is to analyse the capacity, coverage and cost of different enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) infrastructure strategies, as the industry moves towards integrating new 5G spectrum bands and densifying existing networks. Both a supply-driven and demand-driven investment analysis is undertaken using a case study of the Netherlands. The supply-driven analysis estimates the capacity that can be provided to users via new spectrum, before network densification via small cells is required. The demand-driven analysis tests a range of required per user speeds including 30, 100 or 300 Mbps and quantifies the performance of investment strategies in meeting this demand. The key contribution is estimating the traffic threshold delivered per user from integrating 5G spectrum bands on the existing Dutch macrocell network. Based on the inputs of this analysis, we find that 5G spectrum bands provide an average per user traffic capacity improvement of approximately 40% for the Netherlands in comparison with the existing LTE capacity. © 2019",""

Mobile tourism shopping refers to the use of m-devices to shop for tourism products and services. Given the benefits and potential of this channel, the acceptance however is not widespread and currently an under-addressed topic among academicians. Specifically practitioners are also sceptical if consumers are ready to accept this alternative channel. Drawing upon the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Usage of Technology (UTAUT) as a baseline model, the proposed model was integrated with flow theory, psychological characteristic, social environment and security concern factors to study on the mobile consumers' behavioral intention. Through the use of Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling of 503 mobile respondents, it was discovered that some of the structural paths are not consistent with past literatures. Additionally, a non-parametric permutation approach has also been conducted to discover the gender and age differences in the decision making. The findings however are mixed and therefore require further testing. This study has valuable contributions to academicians, practitioners, and society.

Building upon self-disclosure theory and previous studies, the principal purpose of this present research is to systematically explore the relationships among microblog utilization, online self-disclosure, friendship maintenance, and perceived life satisfaction. A web-based survey was implemented using a total of 426 university students in Northwestern China. Structural equation modeling reveals that intensity of microblog use is positively associated with these students’ friendship maintenance and life satisfaction. Additionally, online self-disclosure plays the crucial mediatory role in the relationships between microblog use, quality of relationships, and gratification with life. The results imply that as microbloggers disclosure their inner thoughts or emotional states with other users online, they could foster their friendship maintenance and obtain greater life satisfaction. However, contrary to the expectation, students’ friendship maintenance is not discovered to be a significant predictor of the sense of life satisfaction in the online environment. Overall, these obtained outcomes of the empirical work could offer new insights into the deep comprehending of the social psychological process of microblogging among younger generation in the new media context. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Friendship maintenance; Life satisfaction; Microblog use; Self-disclosure; Social media"

With the enhancement of mobile technologies and the emergence of social networking sites, a new platform of advertising has emerged. Mobile social media advertising refers to the use of social networking sites on mobile devices to advertise tourism products and services. However, many tourism organizations are skeptical, particularly if tourists are ready to accept this new form of advertising. Therefore, this study proposes an integrated framework that consists of Mobile Technology Acceptance Model, personal factors (i.e., mobile self-efficacy and technology self-efficacy), and Interactivity Theory to understand consumers’ intention to adopt mobile social media advertising in receiving tourism-related advertisements. 459 valid data were analyzed by the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling technique.

By means of mixed model regression analyses, with the prominence of different source types in the search results as dependent variables, it was tested whether search results vary across Google Search users. The results indicate that the inclusion of participants as a random effect does not explain variance when controlling for the different query keywords and the time at which the queries were ran.

However, social media have been found to have an echo chamber effect, which may be detrimental to democracy. They may help to accelerate the ascendancy of a “post-truth” era in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief. A study on political polarization, however, showed that selective exposure and avoidance in social media are weak indicators of polarization (Johnson et al., 2017). This study examines the role of social media in democracy and partisan politics. The authors considered that despite the echo chamber effect, social media have a limited part to play in the formation of polarized stances compared with other factors, such as demographics, political orientation, and mass media use. The study tested two main hypotheses: H1: Social media use is associated with political stance that is marginalized in the mainstream media; H2: Political orientation has a stronger relationship than social media use with the stance toward political values and social issues. The results supported both hypotheses. Social media are associated with political stance that is marginalized in the mainstream media. However, when compared with other factors, the relationship between social media and stance becomes less obvious. Although the echo chamber effect may reinforce the original stance, social media do not exhibit a strong relationship with the stance toward political values and social issues. Partisan orientation and use of partisan mass media are found to have stronger links with variations in stance. Social media, however, provide a subaltern public sphere for those excluded from the dominant public sphere, thus extending the public sphere to accommodate multiple opinions and perspectives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Echo chamber effects; Political partisanship; Public sphere; Social media; Subaltern public sphere"

However, only a few researchers have used the context of mobile auctions to explore the impulsive buying behaviors of consumers. Therefore, our study selects the mobile auction platform to explore how situational factors affect impulsive buying behavior. We integrate the S-O-R model, impulsivity traits and other external variables to establish our research model and hypotheses. Our results show that the personality factors of an impulsive buying tendency, normative evaluation, and positive affect are key determinants of impulse buying, while ubiquity, ease of use, information exchange, discounted price, and scarcity are important precursors. In addition, gender and platform categorizations are also used to classify the sample to determine the differences between groups defined by these classifications.

To construct a theoretical framework of public interest in continued use of government information portals, we interviewed 56 respondents and coded the interview data. Next, we tested the resulting model using data collected from a questionnaire-based survey of 354 users. The Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) results indicate that continued use is influenced by psychological perception, user characteristics, service parameters of the government portals and the government's idea. Of these, psychological perception was found to have the strongest effect.

This study examines the facilitation of consumer loyalty toward branded apps (continuance intention, in-app purchase intention, and word-of-mouth intention) from the dual-route perspective. One route is the affective (relationship) route, where brand benefits (functional benefits, experiential benefits, symbolic benefits, and monetary benefits) drive parasocial interactions between consumers and the brand, which, in turn, influences branded app loyalty. The other route is the utility route, where system characteristics (system quality and information quality) affect perceived usefulness, which, in turn, facilitates branded app loyalty. An online survey was conducted, and the research model was empirically tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The findings support the dual-route perspective according to which both affective and utilitarian paths facilitate branded app loyalty. The key theoretical contribution of this study is that it moves beyond the utilitarian path and finds the affective (relationship) path to give a more complete picture of the facilitation of consumer loyalty in the branded app context. A strategy is provided to suggest to practitioners how to design branded apps to facilitate consumer loyalty. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Brand benefits; Branded applications; Information quality; Parasocial interaction; Perceived usefulness; System quality"

Although some say that fitspiration inspires women towards an empowered body image, others argue that fitspirational social media use may negatively influence women's body image. To address these concerns, the current study (359 women; ages 18–28 years) investigated how exposure to four types of fitspirational social media messages related to three indicators of body image: body dissatisfaction, compulsive exercise, and situated optimism related to body goals. Moreover, we investigated the role of two individual difference variables in predicting women's exposure to fitspirational messages and moderating the relationships between exposure and indicators of body image: thin-ideal internalization and fit-ideal internalization.

The study confirms that this process is serially mediated by perceived threat severity, perceived susceptibility, and negative emotions. These psychological mediators, however, function differently between uncertainty avoidance and social media usage. For uncertainty avoidance, a high arousal negative emotion (e.g., anger, fear) is a more essential step to influence engagement intentions than a low arousal emotion (e.g., shame, guilt). For social media usage, however, the type of aroused negative emotions does not matter. Rather, the relationship social media usage has with information seeking is different from that with support seeking and negative word-of-mouth intentions. Social media usage induces information seeking intentions only through publics’ cognitive appraisals of the situation without the activation of negative emotions, while it induces supporting seeking and negative word-of-mouth intentions through both cognitive appraisals and negative emotion arousals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Crisis emotions; Extended parallel process model; Social media engagement; Social media usage; Uncertainty avoidance"

Compulsive usage of smartphones, however, affects the users’ emotional and physical health. The objective of this study is to examine how personality characteristics are related to compulsive smartphone usage and if compulsive smartphone usage impacts users’ ill being. Personality characteristics such as extraversion and conscientiousness are found to be leading to the compulsive smartphone usage, whereas neuroticism, openness to new experience, and agreeableness are found to be negatively influencing compulsive smartphone usage. Extraversion is found to have maximum influence on an individual's compulsive tendency to use smartphone, followed by conscientiousness. The findings of this study also made the authors believe that compulsive smartphone usage, affects both emotional (affecting inter-personal and family relationships) and physical (lack of quality sleep and physical discomfort) health of the smartphone users. Emotional health, however, is found to be more affected by compulsive smartphone usage compared to physical health. Given these findings, it is desirable that youths in Indian should be appropriately guided to use smartphones judiciously so that they do not end up being the victims of compulsive usage and subsequently addiction. © 2018","Compulsive smartphone usage; Five factor model personality emotional ill-being; India; Personality theory; Physical ill-being"

The associations between peer feedback importance and self-esteem as well as depressed mood were also examined. Drawing on coping theory, this study further investigated how the importance of peer feedback and depressed mood influence girls’ coping responses to the stress from lacking feedback. The results of structural equation modeling demonstrate that self-esteem exerts a negative effect on the importance of peer feedback and depressed mood, but the importance of peer feedback is positively associated with depressed mood. In addition, both the importance of peer feedback and depressed mood positively impact problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies. The results suggest that peer feedback has become a “KPI” of selfie-posting behaviors for teenage girls, and these girls handle the involved stress by a concomitant adoption of both types of coping. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Coping; Depressed mood; Peer feedback; Self-esteem; Social media; Teenager"

Many of the communication formats used in EMC are text-based (e.g., instant messaging), and users often include visual paralinguistic cues in their messages. In the current study, we examined the usage of two such cues – emoji and emoticons. Specifically, we compared self-reported frequency of use, as well as attitudes (6 bipolar items, e.g., “fun” vs. “boring”) and motives for their usage (9 motives, e.g., “express how I feel to others”). We also examined these indicators according to age and gender. Overall, participants (N = 474, 72.6% women; Mage = 30.71, SD = 12.58) reported using emoji (vs. emoticons) more often, revealed more positive attitudes toward emoji usage, and identified more with motives to use them. Moreover, all the ratings were higher among younger (vs. older) participants. Results also showed that women reported to use emoji (but not emoticons) more often and expressed more positive attitudes toward their usage than men. However, these gender differences were particularly evident for younger participants. No gender differences were found for emoticons usage. These findings add to the emerging body of literature by showing the relevance of considering age and gender, and their interplay, when examining patterns of emoji and emoticons use. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Electronic-mediated communication; Emoji; Emoticon; Individual differences; Nonverbal cues; Self-report evaluation"

How media practices currently support social sustainability are described and discussed. Then, we present our line of inquiry on print newspapers, which have come to be seen as the weakest layer in the network of personal media. We analyze the specific relationship between sustainability and the model of communication of print newspapers. In particular, we attempt to articulate a comparison between the model of print newspapers and that of online information in order to explore whether the communication model of print remains sustainable by complementing the digital media and the social media network. Then we compare the two economic models – print and online.

However, no unified view as to whether people play MMORPGs for extrinsic or intrinsic rewards has been proposed in the existing literature. Thus, this study drew upon flow theory, Veblen's Leisure Class theory, and Yee's online gaming motivations framework to investigate the effects of extrinsic and intrinsic motivations on the gamer loyalty and gaming behaviors of Turkish MMORPG players. A path model was proposed to articulate the aforementioned relationships. The model showed that gamer loyalty could be predicted by status seeking (extrinsic motivation) and two facets of flow (merging of actions and awareness, and autotelic experience; intrinsic motivation). Furthermore, the game levels reached while playing MMORPGs were affected both by status seeking (extrinsic motivation) and high control of the game (intrinsic motivation). The results also demonstrated that participants with higher social motivation spent more of their daily time on MMORPGs, and players who reported higher levels of autotelic experience spent more money on MMORPGs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Flow theory; Gaming motivations; Leisure class theory; MMORPG; Online video games"

The management and prevention of these diseases can be done by controlling the behavioral and biological risk factors which are related to them. ChronicPrediction is an intelligent system for noncommunicable diseases care which determines in real time the impact on risk factors due to actions taken by users. Based on impact information, the system presents on users’ smartphones strategic messages to help in their treatment. ChronicPrediction applies Bayesian Networks (BNs) which use risk factors for mapping the causes of noncommunicable diseases worsening. The support to multiple chronic diseases and the integrated use of multiple BNs based on risk factors are the main contributions of this work and differentiate the proposed system from related work. We have built a functional prototype that allowed us to conduct two experiments. The first one successfully tested the main functionalities provided by ChronicPrediction to support BNs based on risk factors and the sending of messages to users’ smartphones. The evaluation involved the building of a BN for predicting coronary artery disease made with real world data obtained in a prospective cohort study. The study involved 302 patients from a hospital localized in southern Brazil. The second experiment assessed the ChronicPrediction support to multiple BNs at same time. The test involved the previous BN and another from a thirty part research work to map risk factors of diabetes.

Results show that RF has effects on hedonic GS, and heuristic IP and systematic IP. Hedonic GS positively predicts equally both heuristic processing and systematic processing. Both heuristic processing and systematic processing predict selection style. Although selection style does not affect download app type diversity, impulsive style consumers are more likely to download the app. The study also shows college consumers in general have high likelihood in downloading an app after they considered it. Hedonic GS mediates the relation between RF and both heuristic processing and systematic processing. Systematic processing mediates hedonic GS and selection style.

System insecurity and privacy leakage were found to arouse worries among the app-users while their awareness of protecting personal data was found to have room for improvement. Islands of real-time parking information occur as a result of the lack of collaboration among private carpark operators.

The integration of film and VR is becoming an important breakthrough for traditional films. This new types of film, named cinematic virtual reality (CVR), provides immersive VR experience where individual users can immerse themselves in synthetic world experience in 360° (Mateer, 2017). However, the characteristics and influence of this new digital media on human emotion is far from clear. In this study, we conducted an experiment to investigate the different emotional effects of CVR by comparing with a traditional two-dimensional (2D) film from two critical aspects: subjective emotional experience and real-time objective physiological reaction. Our results first revealed that the subjective experience and the physiological reaction showed significantly stronger emotional effect in the CVR condition than in the 2D condition. Upon further observation, we found that four emotions (excitement, nervousness, hostility, and jitteriness) are more closely correlated with the CVR than with the traditional 2D film. Real-time analysis of skin temperature shows a faster and steadier decline in the CVR group than in the 2D group. Finally, we summarized the causality of the effect by analyzing the characteristics of CVR. Our study suggests that CVR is an effective medium that induces stronger emotional experience and physiological reaction than traditional 2D film can. The design of the VR environment in CVR, as a key feature in the narrative of a film story, has an important influence on the emotional processing of the audience. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cinematic virtual reality (CVR); Emotion; Film; Physiological reaction; Two-dimensional (2D); Virtual reality(VR)"

Specifically, this study included platforms other than Facebook and tested differential effects of each platform. Because happiness is not entirely relative, it was hypothesized that social comparison would influence only relative happiness, which is only one part of overall happiness. A two-wave longitudinal survey among Korean females revealed that the use of blogs, Instagram, and LinkedIn is positively associated with social comparison at Wave 1 (W1), whereas Twitter is negatively associated. LinkedIn use was most strongly associated with social comparison. In turn, social comparison at W1 negatively predicted relative happiness at W2 (“I am happier than my friends”) but did not predict overall happiness at W2. Social media may lead us to believe that other people's lives are better through social comparison. However, such comparison influences only part of overall happiness or life satisfaction.

Given the rising incidence of dropout of private entrepreneurs causing premature closure of telecentres, it is important to understand and identify key variables that affect sustainability of the scheme. In appreciation of the difficulty associated with operationalisation of the term 'sustainability’ in this study we adopt ‘operational sustainability’ as an alternative to investigate the dynamics of sustenance. We have reviewed key literature about various dimensions of sustainability and their interrelationships in order to develop hypotheses about sustainability of the UDC and factors associated with it. Drawing on data collected from a survey of 538 private entrepreneurs and 41 interviews with government officials we show the extent to which various elements of the UDC eco-system contribute to its sustainability. The application of a structural equation model confirms that both financial and social outcomes of the UDC depend largely on inputs and contributions of various stakeholders.

Also, posts by the American Cancer Society received more likes, comments, and shares than other source categories. Findings also indicated that though message features were related to likes, comments, and shares, the nature of relationship and the role of different features varied with each measure. Overall, findings highlight the role of motivational activation through message factors in eliciting user response in social media environments. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","American Cancer Society; Facebook; LCM4P; Message relevance; Social media engagement; Source credibility"

Prediction of cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of the most important subject in the section of clinical data analysis. The amount of data in the healthcare industry is huge. Data mining turns the large collection of raw healthcare data into information that can help to make informed decision and prediction. There are some existing studies that applied data mining techniques in heart disease prediction. Nonetheless, studies that have given attention towards the significant features that play a vital role in predicting cardiovascular disease are limited. It is crucial to select the correct combination of significant features that can improve the performance of the prediction models. This research aims to identify significant features and data mining techniques that can improve the accuracy of predicting cardiovascular disease. Prediction models were developed using different combination of features, and seven classification techniques: k-NN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network and Vote (a hybrid technique with Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression). Experiment results show that the heart disease prediction model developed using the identified significant features and the best-performing data mining technique (i.e. Vote) achieves an accuracy of 87.4% in heart disease prediction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Classification algorithms; Data mining; Feature selection; Heart disease prediction; Prediction model"

Since receiving phishing e-mails is an important prerequisite of victimization, this study focusses on becoming a phishing target. More precisely, we use an integrative lifestyle exposure model to study the effects of risky online routine activities that make a target more likely to come across a motivated offender. Insights of the lifestyle exposure model are combined with propensity theories in order to determine which role impulsivity plays in phishing targeting. To achieve these objectives, data collected in 2016 from a representative sample (n = 723) were used. Support was found for a relationship between both online purchasing behavior and digital copying behavior, and phishing targeting. Moreover, a relationship was found between all online activities (except for online purchasing behavior) and impulsivity. The present study thus suggests that especially online shoppers and users who often share and use copied files online should be trained to deal with phishing attacks appropriately. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cybercrime; Digital copying; Impulsivity; Lifestyle exposure model; Online purchasing; Phishing targeting"

Developers of applications are usually unknown, and users are unaware of how their data are being managed and used. This is combined with the emergence of new threats due to the deficiency in mobile applications development or the design ambiguities of the current mobile operating systems. A number of mobile operating systems are available in the market, but the Android platform has gained the topmost popularity. However, Android security model is short of completely ensuring the privacy and security of users’ data, including the data of mHealth applications. Despite the security mechanisms provided by Android such as permissions and sandboxing, mHealth applications are still plagued by serious privacy and security issues. These security issues need to be addressed in order to improve the acceptance of mHealth applications among users and the efficacy of mHealth applications in the healthcare systems. Thus, this paper presents a conceptual framework to improve the security of medical data associated with Android mHealth applications, as well as to protect the privacy of their users. Based on the literature review that suggested the need for the intended security framework, three-distinct and successive phases are presented, each of which is described in a separate section. First, discussed the design process of the first phase to develop a security framework for mHealth apps to ensure the security and privacy of sensitive medical data. The second phase is discussed who to achieve the implementation of a prototypic proof-of-concept version of the framework. Finally, the third phase ending discussed the evaluation process in terms of effectiveness and efficiency for the proposed framework. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",""

We explored the effects of information from online advertising and electronic word-of-mouth on destination expectations and the resulting satisfaction and revisit intentions. Data from 354 first-time visitors to Japan were analyzed in a two-step approach using a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling. Four indirect effects were examined and compared using the bootstrap method. We found that information about destinations from online advertising was negatively associated with positive disconfirmations. However, destination information acquired from electronic word-of-mouth led to an increase in the likelihood of a positive disconfirmation, and it significantly increased travel satisfaction and revisit intentions. In addition, four indirect paths through a positive disconfirmation were confirmed. However, there was no moderating effect of search effort. Based on our findings, marketers should be aware that elaborate online advertising may have factors that undermine future business. To avoid the negative disconfirmation, marketers can remind customers that the photos and videos in advertisements were taken at specific times, places, seasons, or under other conditions. Moreover, marketers should encourage their consumers to share their previous travel experiences online to offset the negative disconfirmation from destination advertising and websites. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","eWOM; Expectancy disconfirmation theory; Information search effort; Online advertising"

One example of this information we define as the Learner Learning Trail (LLT), which is the sequence of interactions between the students and the virtual environment. Another example is the Learner Learning Style (LLS), which is associated with the student behavior and choices during the learning process. This information can be used to identify learner behavior and learning style. We perceived, after the study of related literature, that the research field of learner diagnosis for ODL does not apply the conjoint use of LLT and LLS. In this article, we propose a model capable of integrating data generated from the behavior of students in ODL with cognitive aspects of them, such as their Learning Styles, by crossing LLT with LLS. We also propose the CPAD method (Collect, Preprocessing, Analysis, Diagnosis), which is implemented by collecting the raw data regarding learning activities, preprocessing the data into structured time sequences, analyzing the sequences regarding the learning styles and using this analysis to diagnose the learner behavior. We selected the dropout to investigate, once the dropout rate in ODL is a real problem in universities around the world. In addition, the dropout is a student decision which can be associated with previous students behaviors. We performed a study with 202 learners to evaluate if learning styles are capable of explaining aspects of the student behavior. The results suggest that Sequential/Global learning style dimension is more capable of explaining the dropout than the other dimensions. Also, we performed four classification experiments to verify how the dimensions of Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model influence the learner diagnosis. We perceived that the Sequential/Global dimension could provide a higher accuracy average with lower variation independently of the diagnosis technique. © 2018","Diagnosis support; Learner diagnosis; Learning style; Learning trail"

Using webpages of a major crowdfunding platform (N = 4123), the author found that only a limited number of projects leveraged the benefits of embedding videos and pictures. Although having more videos and pictures generally predicted an increase in donation, the increase was unevenly distributed across different categories of projects. Meanwhile, topic modeling distinguished word clusters from description texts. While a variety of topic words relating to factual details positively predicted the fundraising outcomes, clusters featuring the overuse of requesting words such as “help” “money” and “thank” seemed to backfire. The findings shed light on the complex contingencies of communication modality effects across different types of projects and provide guidelines for more effective message design in crowdfunding campaigns. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Category; Crowdfunding; Modality; Picture; Text; Video"

People living in conflicting zones are emotionally degraded and often hold more negativity than the people living in serene areas. Nowadays, analyzing the emotions shared on social networking websites is an ongoing topic of research. In this paper, we presented the potential of user data available on the Facebook website in distinguishing the emotions of netizens in conflicting versus non-conflicting areas. We collected the Facebook posts of the users living in Kashmir (conflicting region) and Delhi (non-conflicting) with the help of two source accounts. Plutchik's eight basic emotions, namely, fear, anger, sadness, joy, surprise, disgust, trust and anticipation have been used to determine the emotion state of a user. Based on two well-known lexicons, namely, EmoLex and Empath, a new dictionary called MoodBook is designed to determine the user emotions from their posts. After analyzing the data, we found that violence in the conflicting region has badly affected the psychology of the citizens as most of the people in Kashmir fall under three negative emotion categories, namely, fear, anger, and sadness, whereas the joy mood has been found more in the posts of Delhi-based users. Furthermore, a mood-vector is created for each user and used as an input to k-means clustering where it has been found that the citizens of two regions form separate groups based on their psychological state. The study of the difference between emotions expressed online by the citizens of conflicting and non-conflicting has not been seen in the literature till date. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Clustering; Conflicted regions; Emotion analysis; Facebook; Mood analysis; Online Social Network Analysis (OSNA); Psychological health"

The results showed that e-governance diffusion was linear, not sigmoid-shape, as literature suggests. In general, cumulative adoption rate grows faster and peak adoption rate increases as user age decreases, and is higher among women. E-service usage duration does not increase faster than usage depth. Usage depth and duration increased with age, though not linearly, and were higher in women.

Given the lack of empirical research that investigates why data visualization influences user engagement, the current study examines interactivity as an underlying mechanism. The level of interactivity in data visualization (low vs. high) was varied, along with the level of interactivity in a narrative of an obese character (low vs. high) in a 2 × 2 factorial-design experiment with 385 valid participants. Results showed that increased message interactivity for the narrative, presented with increased modality interactivity for data visualization, led to a greater empathic perception of obese individuals’ hardships and greater perceived severity of obesity, and less defensive responses to the website.

Despite their potential role in supporting and revitalising minority languages, minority language app markets remain practically unstudied. Minority language app markets face obvious challenges due to their small absolute size (in terms of consumers, developers and apps) and their small relative size compared to the majority language app market. This paper examines the Apple (UK) App Store market for a specific minority language, Cymraeg (the Welsh language), providing a deeper understanding of the market from a developer's perspective. Data gathering was conducted using two methods; a census of apps and structured interviews. The census identified 439 Welsh language apps which were analysed to identify emergent characteristics and potentially significant factors in the market, which informed the subsequent interviews. Interviews were conducted with three highly active app development companies, representing about 2% of the developers and 9% of the apps identified in the census. An interview was also conducted with the Welsh Language Unit of the Welsh Government. This paper weaves together the observations and data from the census with the qualitative responses from the interviews, to present a rich picture of the Welsh language app market in the Apple (UK) App Store. The paper concludes by suggesting ways in which the Welsh language app market could potentially be made more vital and sustainable. While this paper focusses on the Welsh language app market, it provides a deeper understanding of minority language app markets more generally. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Apps; Cymraeg; Minority languages; Mobile application market; Mobile phones; Smartphones; Welsh"

A combination of textual analysis and content analysis revealed two main findings. First, different networks of expertise on Weibo generated conflicting discourses about TCM: while the scientific community contributed the overwhelming majority of posts that criticized TCM, conventional media outlets were much more likely to promote TCM without skepticism. Implications of the finding is discussed. Second, the social media debate did not appear to facilitate problem solving, evidenced by the fact that only a small portion of the posts included rational comments about the controversy. In addition, users typically communicated only with users who shared their viewpoints, resulting in few communications between groups. The trend illustrates the fragmentation of China's networked public sphere on Weibo. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Grassroots scientific community; Networked public sphere; Social media; Traditional Chinese Medicine"

Focusing on the users’ perspective, this study proposes that (a) adoption of ad blockers is positively influenced by the level of knowledge of their advantageous features; (b) the decision to continue using ad blockers is negatively affected by attitude toward online advertising; and (c) this attitude is positively shaped by perceptions of online advertising's pleasure, credibility, and economic benefits, as well as negatively shaped by perceptions of online advertising's intrusiveness and clutter. We tested these relationships in a survey study among the members of an online panel supported by the Spanish advertising industry, and all the relationships were confirmed within a structural equation model. Our findings provide some implications for online advertising stakeholders. Web publishers and online advertisers may expect that, in the coming years, ad blockers will continue to spread rapidly as a consequence of the extension of their knowledge among Internet users. These stakeholders are thus advised to focus on improving Internet users’ experiences with online advertising by reducing those ad characteristics that provoke negative reactions and by strengthening those that are positively evaluated. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Ad blockers; Advertising avoidance; Attitude toward advertising; Psychological reactance; Self-interest"

Using travelogue data from a large traveling knowledge-sharing community, we used econometric models to investigate and compare the antecedents leading to three different kinds of engagement behavior that users exhibit in online communities (i.e., consuming, contributing, and creating). The results reveal that five attributes are associated with these engagement behaviors. These attributes demonstrate the differential effectiveness on the engagement behaviors with different intensities.

Thus, the current research addressed predictors of digital piracy across two Turkish undergraduate samples. In Study 1, two structural models were tested with 465 students. Latent variables of interest were measured through 21 indicators to address past piracy, present piracy, prosecution risk and piracy attitudes. Followed by the confirmation of the factor structure, two structural models were retained. In the first model, perceived likelihood of prosecution decreased piracy through full mediation of attitudes, whereas past piracy decreased it through partial mediation of attitudes. In the second model, both variables explained current piracy through full mediation of attitudes. In Study 2, 12 social desirability items were added to current measures and tested with a new group (n = 190). The measurement model was confirmed. While prosecution risk and social desirability was related, their contribution to current piracy behaviors was not significant. The links between past and present piracy and attitudes were still strong. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Computer ethics; Digital piracy; Higher education; Prosecution risk; Social desirability"

Though early diagnosis is critical for successful treatment of the disease, immediate reaction in cases of emergency is crucial significance in saving the lives of stricken. Previous studies on patient-centric healthcare indicate that both the patient's whereabouts and the locality of the healthcare centers play a vital role at moment of crisis. Not only it is important for a patient to be able to find the nearest healthcare points, it is also necessary for the emergency centers to know the exact location of the patient seeking for help. To this end, a Location-Based Mobile Cardiac Emergency System (iHeart) is proposed, which is a patient-centric healthcare system, to monitor and track the patient via a wearable device and their mobile phones. Therefore, this study aims to find healthcare professional's opinion and to find success factors of such a system before its full implementation. A survey was conducted in the form of questionnaire in Malaysia and Iran. In order to conduct the survey, a conceptual model was proposed based on DeLone and McLean Information Success Model. A total number of 323 data was collected from both countries. The results were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with AMOS software. Multi-group comparison was applied to find differences in points of view from both countries. The results of this study revealed the success factors of iHeart before the full implementation. It was found that nationality plays a moderating role between some of the success factors and success of iHeart. The success of a patient-centric healthcare system is bound to the culture of a particular nation as well as to the technological advancements, facilities, and the needs of the target users, meaning that in order for a novel healthcare system to be publicly acknowledged and utilized; target users must be classified and assessed accordingly. The findings of the present study are highly beneficial to both patients suffering from Coronary Heart Disease and the healthcare providers that seek to utilize new patient-centric healthcare systems, devices, and electronic applications to rescue patients. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Emergency; Location-based; Mobile healthcare; Multi-group comparison; Nationality; Patient-centric; Success model"

Non-adherence is caused by several factors among which three play an important role: Treatment complexity, cognitive decline, and patient-provider communication. This article presents an ongoing multidisciplinary project, the CONSIGNELA project, which adopts a patient-centered approach for improving medication adherence in these patients. The first objective of the project is to identify the best way to communicate medication prescriptions with tablets and touch-screen devices. The second objective is to improve medication adherence by creating a collaborative application (app) designed both for older and PD patients and for healthcare professionals in charge of them. Two solutions are combined: A cognitive and a technological solutions. The cognitive solution consists in studying in real time older and PD patients while consulting and executing prescriptions presented in different formats to select the most efficient one. The technological solution aims to improve collaboration between health professionals and patients by developing System of Systems (SoS). The research model used in the project includes three phases. Only the results of phase 1 are presented in the article. A research app, CONSIGNELA-Appli-R was programmed to analyze patient cognitive processes while consulting a prescription on a tablet. A pilot study was carried out with young adults to test it. It confirmed a facilitating effect of table format. In parallel, the prototype of a second app, CONSIGNELA-Appli-P, for patients and healthcare providers was developed. It is based on an SoS architecture connecting a virtual pillbox, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) and a knowledge platform. The virtual pillbox is used by patients and providers to improve mutual understanding of medication prescriptions. The MAS provides agents that extract and analyze indicators, actions and information resulting from the interaction between patients and virtual pillboxes. All the information is capitalized and stored in the knowledge platform. Providers can receive charts and dashboards showing information about the following of the medication regimen, for instance, if patients are following it correctly or not. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Elderly patient; Knowledge management; Medication prescription; Multi-agent system; Parkinson's disease; System of Systems"

The proposed work improves the quality of the self-learning process in an adaptive e-learning system by providing the most suitable content for individual learners. The paper depicts the results of personalizing the learning process by tuning the compatibility level of the learning objects with respect to the learning style of the learner, the complexity level of the learning objects with respect to the knowledge level of the learner and the interactivity level of the learner based on the satisfaction level of the learner during the learning process using a modified form of genetic algorithm named as Compatible Genetic Algorithm (CGA). The proposed work improves the efficiency of the genetic algorithms by forcing compatibility in the learning objects which has not been implemented so far in existing systems. Forcing compatibility into the search space not only helps to reduce the search space but also fills the search space with better chromosomes. The results show improvement in scores of the learners and also in their satisfaction levels. A comparison with the standard algorithms shows improvement in execution time, number of executing generations and fitness values. The results indicate that personalization of content delivery based on behavioral traits of learners leads to better learning. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Genetic algorithms; Human-centric learning; Intelligent tutoring systems; Pedagogical issues; Personalization using human behavior"

Although such courses have generated extensive interest, there is as yet sparse literature evaluating the determinants of online course acceptance, especially in developing countries. Seeking to close this gap, this study examines the factors influencing students’ adoption of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in a developing country by applying an integrated framework incorporating the task-technology fit model, social motivation, and self-determination theory. In addition, the study investigates the moderating effect of perceived reputation on students’ adoption behavior. A self-administered survey was employed for data collection and valid responses from 414 participants were used for testing the proposed model. The data was analyzed using structural equation modeling through Smart-PLS. The results establish the significant contribution of task characteristics and technology characteristics in facilitating task-technology fit, and that the fit positively influences behavioral intentions. Moreover, social recognition, perceived competence, and perceived relatedness have positive and significant effects on the behavioral intentions of the students. This research also reveals that perceived reputation has an important moderating effect on the students’ usage behavior.

By using Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), an empirical analysis involving data from 116 social media users is carried out to examine how global and domain-specific values, attitude towards trying and gender affect the intention to interact. The results of a configurational analysis show that gender appears to affect many of the configurations leading to the outcome of interest. There are two configurations in which, regardless of gender, global values, domain-specific values and attitude towards trying cause the outcome.

Even if they are supported by administrative staff, part of their time still consists of administrative procedures or trying to empirically fill or retrieve agendas on the basis of real-time constraints. Similarly, patients waste time waiting for adequate treatments so they occupy slots (beds) in hospitals while their hospitalization is not a necessity. This leads to huge wastes of resources for the hospital that has to hospitalize and prioritize patients in more effective need of care and monitoring. In order to ensure real-time patient support during its entire stay in the hospital (in terms of bed occupancy, appointments with doctors and/or for medico-technical exams) as well as to furnish a central solution open for future IT integration we propose, in this paper, to build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) based software solution. The latter has been built following a socio-technical approach; it maps, at runtime, the working processes of a Belgian hospital. Processes have been modeled in a patient-centric way in order to identify most relevant stages and bottlenecks in bed, cares and medico-technical exams management; real-time data transmission allows to update and re-optimize slots statuses as well as schedules. Also, data analysis (i.e., business intelligence) functions are supported by the MAS implementation for decision making/taking. Further than the proof of concept that shows the managerial support of the software solution, the MAS modules’ benefits to the overall hospital strategy is studied. The latter shows the relevance of the solution to the hospital's governance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Healthcare processes; Intelligent healthcare systems; Multi-agent system; Pervasive healthcare; Socio-technical approach"

However, only a general guideline exists for the description of annual reports (Plain English Rule), and there are no specific regulations on volume and format. As such, it is risky to interpret business managers’ positive expressions because the data can include business managers’ subjective opinions and viewpoints from the companies’ perspectives. Additionally, the business managers’ unrevealed tendencies, such as strategic reporting or cognitive bias, remain unknown. Therefore, this study focuses on the narrative sections of the annual reports that companies need to disclose after every fiscal year-end and uses text mining to determine the relationship between the assessment information of companies created by business managers and the performance of companies. The methodology of this study is grounded in text-mining. To analyze these relationships, we collected all the 10-Ks of all public firms in the United States and employed the text-mining method to identify the tones of these 10-K narratives to determine whether they changed in line with current earnings levels.

Two dimensions of ideology—allowance for government interference in the personal sphere and in the economic sphere—manifest themselves as four types: libertarians (less allowance for interference in both spheres), liberals (less allowance in the personal sphere but more allowance in the economic sphere), conservatives (more allowance in the personal sphere but less allowance in the economic sphere), and communitarians (more allowance in both spheres). Whereas libertarians and liberals have more concerns about government surveillance, conservatives and communitarians have fewer concerns. Given the salient differences between the libertarian-liberal ideology and conservative-communitarian ideology, findings of this study revealed that government interference in the personal sphere matters more for surveillance concerns than government interference in the economic sphere. Actual control for privacy protection, information sensitivity, and perceived transparency predict significantly the level of surveillance concerns. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Government monitoring; Ideology; Privacy concerns; Privacy control; Surveillance concerns"

The main goal of this research is to investigate the antecedents of the intention to purchase a smartwatch. This research develops a conceptual model and hypotheses based on the theory of reasoned action and perceived values from the perspectives of software, hardware, and aesthetic design. An online questionnaire was developed and distributed on popular websites to collect data, and 260 usable responses are collected from the potential users of the Apple Watch in Taiwan. The thirteen hypotheses were validated by using partial least squares (PLS) techniques. Among the antecedents of purchase intention in the model, the attitude towards using smartwatches was found to have the strongest direct effect. Among the factors of the attitude, design aesthetics have the most significant effect. The results also show that all of the factors about smartwatch attributes directly affected the related perceived values. However, social value and performance/quality value did not affect the intention. The model demonstrated relatively good explanatory power for purchase intention in the context of smartwatches. The proposed model can provide insights to smartwatch vendors to develop their new products and marketing strategies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Design aesthetics; Interface convenience; Perceived content; Perceived infrastructure; Perceived value; Smartwatch purchase intention"

The aim of this paper is twofold: (i) to validate the Turkish version of the GTP scale (GTPS), and (ii) to examine the prevalence and the relation between the various dimensions of GTP (e.g., visual perceptions, thoughts, behaviours) and video game players’ individual characteristics (e.g., demographics, gaming habits). A total of 954 frequent players were recruited online. Independently of the different samples used in the original validation of the GTPS and the current study, the findings obtained via confirmatory factor analysis showed that the GTPS-Turkish is reliable and valid and proved to be adequate for measuring GTP. A total of 99% of the players in the sample had experienced some type of GTP. Moreover, the correlational, univariate and multivariate analyses showed associations between various video game player characteristics and GTP. The most remarkable finding was that the prevalence of GTP was higher among minors than adults. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Game Transfer Phenomena; Involuntary phenomena; Turkish; Video games effects"

In the 21st century, the change from the industrial society to a knowledge society has been consolidated, but it has not involved a disruption in the learning context. Some elements, many based on technologies, can be considered disruptive, but they have not had sufficient effect to produce a change in the model that has predominated for 300 years. In 2008, teachers began to offer training outside the walls of the university, with a totally disruptive and chaotic model compared to the traditional one; this was supported by open, informal, cooperative, connectivist, autonomous and self-guided training. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) began with cMOOCs, and most universities join the initiative, but they abandoned this disruption, ultimately offering the same courses they always had with free access for anyone, resulting in the second generation of MOOCs (xMOOCs). These MOOCs responded to a new social demand, but their characteristics and context make a formative disruption – which has not yet emerged – necessary. This paper analyses the elements of the two generations of MOOCs in order to propose a new model that does not require sophisticated technological solutions and recovers the initial disruptive sense of MOOCs, so called ahMOOC. It also presents a case study that integrates the social advantages of cMOOCs, the organisational benefits of xMOOCs and the personalisation of the learning, which is essential due to the heterogeneity of the participants. The results and the participant viewpoints emerging from the case study confirm the feasibility of the model, the improvement of the results of current MOOCs and the need – demanded by the participants – to consider diversity, all of which should be accomplished in a disruptive way. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive system; Informal learning; Massive open online course; Non-formal learning; Personalized learning"

It is known that usability requirements heavily depend on the type, audience and purpose of websites. For the e-commerce environment, usability assessment of a website is required to figure out the impact of website design on customer purchases. Thus, usability assessment and design of online pages have become the subject of many scientific studies. However, in any of these studies, design parameters were not identified in such a detailed way, and they were not classified in line with customer expectations to assess the overall usability of an e-commerce website. This study therefore aims to analyze and classify design parameters according to customer expectations in order to evaluate the usability of e-commerce websites in a more comprehensive manner. Four websites are assessed using the proposed novel approach with respect to the identified design parameters and the usability scores of the websites are examined. It is revealed that the websites with high usability score are more preferred by customers. Therefore, it is indicated that usability of e-commerce websites affects customer purchases. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","E-commerce; Fuzzy sets; Kano model; Usability"
"Recovery of business intelligence systems: Towards guaranteed continuity of patient centric healthcare systems through a matrix-based recovery approach","2018","Telematics and Informatics","10.1016/j.tele.2017.12.010","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039443283&doi=10.1016%2fj.tele.2017.12.010&partnerID=40&md5=ecd7e3a2a1f1494d17784c23f8d20b3b","With the intensive use of the internet, patient centric healthcare systems shifted away from paper-based records towards a computerized format. Electronic patient centric healthcare databases contain information about patients that should be kept available for further reference. Healthcare databases contain potential data that makes them a goal for attackers. Hacking into these systems and publishing their contents online exposes them to a challenge that affects their continuity. Any denial of this service will not be tolerated since we cannot know when we need to retrieve a patient's record. Denial of service affects the continuity of the healthcare system which in turn threatens patients’ lives, decreases the efficiency of the healthcare system and increases the operating costs of the attacked healthcare organization. Although there are many defensive security methods that have been devised, nonetheless malicious transactions may find a way to penetrate the secured safeguard and then modify critical data of healthcare databases. When a malicious transaction modifies a patient record in a database, the damage may spread to other records through valid transactions. Therefore, recovery techniques are required. The efficiency of the data recovery algorithm is substantial for e-healthcare systems. A patient cannot wait too long for his/her medical history to be recovered so that the correct medication be prescribed. Nevertheless, in order to have fast data recovery, an efficient damage assessment process should precede the recovery stage. The damage assessment must be performed as the intrusion detection system detects the malicious activity. The execution time of the recovery process is a crucial factor for measuring the performance because it is directly proportional to the denial of service time of any healthcare system. This paper presents a high performance damage assessment and recovery algorithm for e-healthcare systems. The algorithm provides fast damage assessment after an attack by a malicious transaction to keep the availability of the e-healthcare database. Reducing the execution time of recovery is the key target of our algorithm. The proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithm. It is about six times faster than the most recent proposed algorithm. In the worst case, the proposed algorithm takes 8.81 ms to discover the damaged part of the database; however, the fastest recent algorithm requires 50.91 ms. In the best case, the proposed algorithm requires 0.43 ms, which is 86 times faster than the fastest recent work. This is a significant reduction of execution time compared with other available approaches. Saving the damage assessment time means shorter denial of service periods, which in turn guarantees the continuity of the patient centric healthcare system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Damage assessment; Data dependency; Healthcare data; Recovery; Transaction depedency"

Science is living a golden era characterized by a rapidly growing number of researchers worldwide exploring different disciplines and research fields. Keeping in mind that funding is limited, many researchers are encouraged to establish new collaborations with individuals or groups of researchers. Furthermore, the funding bodies use increasingly complex criteria to determine the researchers and projects to be supported. In this regard, the analysis of scientific collaboration networks can help to determine the main areas of specialization of universities and research centres, as well as the type of internal and external collaborations of their researchers. This paper presents an advanced method for analysing scientific collaboration networks at universities and research institutions. This method is based on automatically obtaining bibliographic data from scientific publications through the use of the Scopus Database API Interface, which are then analysed using graph visualization software and statistical tools. This model has been validated through the analysis of a real university, and the results show that it is possible to determine in a fast way and with high reliability the main research lines of an institution as well as the structure of the collaboration network. The method opens new perspectives for the study of scientific collaboration networks because it can be applied at different levels of detail, from small research groups to large academic and research centres, and over different time frames. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Data mining methods; Database management; Information retrieval; Network analysis; Scientific collaboration"

Brotaru, for instance, is such a physical community of practice for media professionals in Brussels. It is a monthly meet-up of videogame developers in various locations in Brussels. Furthermore, Twitter becomes widely acknowledged as important instrument for learning and community formation in the virtual world. But, do these communities of practice use Twitter only to promote their physical activities of learning? Or, are the activities of the physical communities further extended into the virtual world meaning that virtual communities of practice emerge from them? This article suggests a novel mixed-methods approach based on qualitative and quantitative data to measure the role of Twitter for physical communities of practice. The method applies different statistical measures and analysis on harvested Twitter data and additionally brings two of the most used methods in Twitter analysis together, social network analysis and text data analysis (a.k.a., content analysis). Four different communities of practice in Brussels’ media industry and their activities and followers on Twitter have been analysed. The findings showed that the activities of the communities of practice extend into the Twitter sphere as the online communities are characterised by a shared domain, a lively community and shared practices. The analysis further revealed that Twitter offers three main opportunities for the activities of communities of practice: it offers geographical extension; it gives temporal autonomy; and, it can be used to diversify the practices. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Community of practice; Learning; Media industry; Mixed-methods; Topic modelling; Twitter"

Such physical workouts are required by a plan, which should be designed and supervised by sport specialists and medical assistants. Thus, the exercise sessions shall start with consultation of a coach, doctor and dietician; however, many times this scenario is not presented. In typical activities such as running, cycling and fitness, people use health mobile apps with their smartphones, which offer support for these activities. Nevertheless, the functionality and operation of these applications are isolated, because many and long questionnaires are performed. Additionally, the physical and health state of a user is not considered. These issues would be taken into account for determining recommendations about the time for doing exercise and the kind of activity for each person. In this work, a social semantic mobile framework to generate recommendations where a mobile application allows sensing the physical performance, taking into consideration medical criteria with smartphones is proposed. The approach includes a semantic cross-information that comes from social network and official data as well as sport activities and medical knowledge. This knowledge is translated into application ontologies related directly to health, nutrition and training domains. The methodology also covers physical fitness tests and a monitoring tool for evaluating the nutrition plan and the correct execution of the training. As case study, the mobile application offers to evaluate the physical and health conditions of a runner, automatically generate a nutrition plan and training, monitor plans and recomputed them if users make changes in their routines. The data provided from the social network are used as feedback in the application, in order to make the training and nutrition plans more flexible by applying spatio-temporal analysis based on machine learning. Finally, the generated training and nutrition plans were validated by specialists, they have demonstrated 82% of effectiveness rate in exercise training routines and 86% in nutrition plans.

Location-based augmented reality games posit interesting questions regarding GTP, particularly because they use physical locations, they overlay digital images in physical contexts and the gameplay shifts between the virtual and the physical world. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of GTP and the role of immersion, augmented reality and sound in a sample of English- (EnS) and Spanish- (SpS) speaking gamers of the game Pokémon Go (PoGo). A total of 1313 gamers (Mage = 31.47) were recruited online. GTP was less common than in previous studies; however, 82.4% had experienced GTP at least once. The SpS showed higher prevalence of GTP and played more intensively. Automatic mental processes predominated in the EnS, while behaviours and actions were more common in the SpS. The absence or presence of video game features seems important for the way GTP manifests. For instance, tactile hallucinations were more prevalent, while sensations of self-motion were less reported. Playing with augmented reality (AR) and sounds showed significant correlations with various GTP types, but not with re-experiencing images from the game. More gamers who reported the sensation that Pokémon were physically present or looked for Pokémon outside the screen while playing, as connotations of immersion, had experienced GTP. Experiencing GTP while playing may be more common in location-based augmented reality games, compared to other games. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Auditory cues; Augmented reality games; Game Transfer Phenomena; Immersion; Location-based games; Pokémon Go"

The availability of 4G networks, cyber cafés and fiber connectivity in most residential areas of Nairobi has allowed many Nairobi residents to be part of its information-based society. But, as with the other existing social inequalities in Nairobi, many people residing in the city's low-income areas lack access to the internet. This has a negative impact on the residents’ prospects as the governments and businesses are increasingly delivering their services online. Using a pre-tested questionnaire, data were collected from five hundred and fifty respondents on their internet access and digital literacy skills among the residents of the Mathare Slum. From the survey, the study found existence of limited digital literacy skills and lack of internet access among the residents of the Mathare Slum. The study then used the Community Technology Centers (CTCs) intervention approach to narrowing the digital divide by setting up a CTC in the Mathare Slum to offer free community internet access and digital literacy skills training. Eight cohorts, each of eighteen residents, were offered free digital literacy training for five weeks and free unlimited internet access for four months. The study then evaluated the trainees’ internet usage continuance intentions after four months of continued use of the internet at the CTC. The results indicate that perceived enjoyment, perceived usefulness, internet self-efficacy, and confirmation of expectations all significantly influence the participants’ satisfaction with use of the internet. The results also show that continuance intentions of the participants from low income household to continue using internet beyond the CTC can be predicted by perceived service cost, satisfaction, internet self-efficacy and perceived usefulness. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of CTCs as an intervention approach and a replicable model that can be used to bridge the urban digital divide among low income urban communities for the development of an all-inclusive information-based society.

Self-administered surveys were used to gather data from a large sample of 1158 young adults, mostly university students in Malaysia (Mage = 21.0 years; SD = 2.16). Findings indicate the presence of cyberbullying perpetration after the schooling years, with 8% (N = 93) bullying, 18.6% (N = 216) victimization, 15.2% (N = 174) bullying and victimization, and 53.4% (N = 675) witnessing a cyberbullying incident in the past one year. Most of the bullies reported to be remorseful; however the majority did nothing after a perpetration. Most of the victims on the other hand, experienced anger, sadness and depression after a victimization with the majority claiming to have defended themselves (75%). The majority of the bully-victims regretted their actions, pitied the victims and felt angry after a cyberbullying perpetration/victimization. Bystanders mostly reported feeling pity for the victim and angry at the bullies, with the majority (61.5%) claiming to have defended the victims.

This study identifies four underlying smartphone application personality dimensions: interactive and daring, interesting and attractive, open and wide-ranging, and principled and wholesome. The smartphone application personalities reveal the strong interactive property of smartphones. This study also investigates how smartphone users’ personalities, smartphone social applications that connect people directly or indirectly, and perceived social capital accrued through smartphone social application usage contribute to smartphone application personality. The analysis shows that the shift from voice calls and SMS to Facebook and instant messaging causes traditional communication applications to play little role in contributing to smartphone application personality. In addition to having hedonic value, entertainment applications should also be viewed as able to contribute to social capital and all of the smartphone application personality dimensions. Although the neuroticism personality of smartphone users plays a lesser role than extraversion in contributing to smartphone social application usage, social capital formation and smartphone application personality, smartphones are useful for individuals high in neuroticism to gain social capital. The inward-looking and exclusiveness properties of bonding social capital cause it to contribute negatively to the interactive and attractive smartphone application personality. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Smartphone application personality; Smartphone social applications; Smartphone user's personality; Social capital"

This study aims to investigate whether PPPs access in a hospital environment violates patient privacy. If so, to what extent can we manage patient privacy while accessing PPPs in this environment? We investigated this question by analyzing questionnaire-based data from two Asian countries: Group A (China) and Group B (Pakistan). For data collection, we targeted those medical entities which were directly dealing with PPPs in their routine tasks. Results suggest that patient type directly influences the collection of PPPs: Group A (one-time = 1.9, follow-up = 1.06) and Group B (one-time = 2.0 and follow-up = 1.9). Both groups agreed that patients have the right to control their own PPPs. In both, doctors are the most trusted entity: for Group A, the Pearson Chi-Square with one degree of freedom is 1.414, p = 0.234, whereas for Group B, the Pearson Chi-Square with three degrees of freedom is 4.511, p = 0.11. Most of the Group A entities (92%) are familiar with unauthorized access of PPPs, while in Group B the level was only 35%. In Group B, only 35% of entities stated the purpose, specification and use limitations of PPPs. Doctors in both groups showed a high utilization of PPPs read authorization rights. This empirical evidence about PPPs usage in both countries will benefit health technology and improve policy on patient privacy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Asian countries; Authorization rights; Information (PHI); Patient; Patient physiological parameters (PPPs); Personal health; Privacy management"

Social media portals offer powerful public platforms where people can freely share their opinions and feelings about various topics with large crowds. In the current study, we investigated the public opinions and sentiments towards the Syrian refugee crisis, which has affected millions of people and has become a widely discussed, polarizing topic in social media around the world. To analyze public sentiments about the topic on Twitter, we collected a total of 2381,297 relevant tweets in two languages including Turkish and English. Turkish sentiments were considered important as Turkey has welcomed the largest number of Syrian refugees and Turkish tweets carried information to reflect public perception of a refugee hosting country first handedly. We performed a comparative sentiment analysis of retrieved tweets. The results indicated that the sentiments in Turkish tweets were significantly different from the sentiments in English tweets. We found that Turkish tweets carried slightly more positive sentiments towards Syrians and refugees than neutral and negative sentiments, nevertheless the sentiments of tweets were almost evenly distributed among the three major categories. On the other hand, the largest number of English tweets by a significant margin contained neutral sentiments, which was followed by the negative sentiments. In comparison to the ratio of positive sentiments in Turkish tweets, 35% of all Turkish tweets, the proportion of English tweets contained remarkably less positive sentiments towards Syrians and refugees, only 12% of all English tweets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; Refugee; Sentiment analysis; Text mining; Twitter"

Though stating that they want to be enlightened in academia, some qualitative comments from millennials indicate the opposite, namely that they want to be prepared but also to be kept naïve as to what business really entails. This is expected to help keep motivation levels high, as motivation is seen to be the key element to success in life. Millennials expect also to be led authentically and to be treated as valued human beings. This is in contrast to the current autocratic leadership profile found predominantly in Portuguese organizations, at the time of writing. This study had a sample of one hundred and eleven millennial students who answered a survey on attitudes towards leadership and their desired approach to higher education. Three interviews with seasoned executives were also performed, to establish a contrast and see other perspectives.

The disruption generated by the fast changes point out to the immediacy of the needed changes in higher education for responding the new and changing world. The millenarians or digital natives are already used to living with technology, but the technological changes are so fast that if they do not prepare to face them, they will become obsolete soon. Hence the importance of continuous training and the need for institutions and companies to promote training courses for their employees. The higher education institutions have a key role on the promotion of knowledge and on the innovation, but this new scenario is an unexpected challenge that is difficult to face. Incorporating teaching of information and communications technology in universities within the curriculum, as a cross-training topic, is a difficult but necessary challenge for preparing students for success in labor market.

Of particular interest were the considerations of pre-service teachers concerning the age levels of a target audience that they believed would benefit from instruction with this particular educational tool. Following a mixed-research methodological pattern, the study was conducted in two consecutive stages. The first stage involved a quasi-experiment and the second was handled as a case study. In order to examine the long-term effects of Wiki activities supported by gamification elements on student academic success, a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical test was conducted based on scores from an initial pre-knowledge test, an applied interim examination, and a final examination. In order to determine the opinions of teacher candidates regarding Wiki activities and the process of gamification, results from an open-ended questionnaire were consulted. It was eventually discovered that students in both the Wiki-only (p = 0.02) and gamified-Wiki (p = 0.00) activity groups displayed significantly greater academic success compared to a control group. Although gamification elements also caused a significant difference between the two Wiki groups in terms of the number of times content is displayed (1670 > 637) and edited (38 > 18), it was observed that participation rates fell over time in both groups. As for academic success, there was no difference between the two Wiki groups (p = 0.92). It was found that teacher candidates regard Wiki and gamification activities positively. Also, it was noted that they did not possess an adequate level of consciousness of the fact that student capabilities are an important factor in making effective use of technology. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Gamification; Integration of technology in education; Web 2.0; Wiki"

It is a key element of product development and marketing in many industries, such as the smartphone industry, which employs user segmentation to gather information about usage logs, to produce new products for such specific groups of users. However, previous studies on smartphone user segmentation have been primarily based on demographics and reported usage, which are inherently subjective and prone to skew by the observers and participants. Hamka et al. (2014) was the first to conduct a study, in which smartphone user segmentation was performed using log data collected through smartphone measurements. However, they focused only on network usage and the number of apps used, and not on characteristics or preferences. In this study, we proposed novel ways of segmenting smartphone users based on app usage sequences collected from smartphone logs. We proposed a variant of seq2seq architecture combining the advantages of previous deep neural networks: neural embedding architecture and seq2seq architecture. Furthermore, we compared the user segmentation results of the proposed method with an answer set of segmentation results conducted by domain experts. These experiments demonstrated that the proposed method effectively determines similarities between usage sequences and outperforms existing user segmentation methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","App usage sequence; Neural network; Seq2seq; Smartphone; User segmentation"

Informal data related to an award-winning public space (Gillett Square in London, UK) was retrieved from two social networks (Flickr and Twitter), and from its official website. The analysis focused on semantic, temporal and spatial patterns, aspects generally overlooked in traditional approaches. Text-mining techniques were used to relate semantic and temporal data, focusing on seasonal and weekly (work-leisure) cycles, and the geographic patterns were extracted both from geotagged pictures and by geocoding user locations.

Learning materials can be retrieved from structured repositories, such as repositories of Learning Objects and Massive Open Online Courses; they could also come from unstructured sources, such as web hypertext pages. Platforms for distance education often implement algorithms for recommending specific educational resources and personalized learning paths to students. But choosing and sequencing the adequate learning materials to build adaptive courses may reveal to be quite a challenging task. In particular, establishing the prerequisite relationships among learning objects, in terms of prior requirements needed to understand and complete before making use of the subsequent contents, is a crucial step for faculty, instructional designers or automated systems whose goal is to adapt existing learning objects to delivery in new distance courses. Nevertheless, this information is often missing. In this paper, an innovative machine learning-based approach for the identification of prerequisites between text-based resources is proposed. A feature selection methodology allows us to consider the attributes that are most relevant to the predictive modeling problem. These features are extracted from both the input material and weak-taxonomies available on the web. Input data undergoes a Natural language process that makes finding patterns of interest more easy for the applied automated analysis. Finally, the prerequisite identification is cast to a binary statistical classification task. The accuracy of the approach is validated by means of experimental evaluations on real online coursers covering different subjects. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Curriculum sequencing; E-learning; Learning object; Machine learning; Prerequisite"

Rapid adoption of PCBMD in healthcare ushers at the cost of its security and privacy concerns. Current methods focus on identifying authorized users who can access PCBMD but they barely identify the insider attackers. Alternatively, these methods do not prevent information leak by authorized users. Working towards this direction, this paper proposes a Trust based Access Control (TAC) system which not only identifies authorized users for PCBMD but also defends Sensitive Personal Information (SPI) of a patient from insider attacks. The proposed method calculates the trust value of each user by considering various quantitative parameters. Based on the calculated trust values, access rights are granted to each user such that SPI can be accessed by only highly trustworthy users. To implement access rights securely, a privacy scheme is also proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed security system can be efficiently used to protect the SPI of patients. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Access Control; Information security; Patient Centric Big Medical Data; Privacy; Trust"

Data were collected from followers of digital publications. The dynamics of the sense of community is described as a process in which informational value and identification are essential to nurturing readers’ soft or hard commitment.

Contrary to a tendency in academic literature and public debates to consider private and state surveillance as a single phenomenon in terms of methods, magnitude, and practice, findings show that individuals distinguish between these two types of surveillance when it comes to compliance and consent. Support for state surveillance is much more widespread and does not correlate with consent to private sector surveillance. Furthermore, support and consent to surveillance are rather nuanced, with different factors predicting different types of surveillance, according to the justifications and contexts of surveillance methods: Private sector surveillance is predicted by the compensation offered to subjects, factors related to behavior in online social networks and age. With regard to state surveillance- support varies between surveillance as part of the war against terrorism, which is most common and predicted by political trust and support for other types of state surveillance, surveillance for security reasons which is predicted by age, political interest, political orientation and support for anti-terror surveillance, and surveillance in general- which is least common and predicted by religiosity, level of privacy settings in SNS, political trust and anti-terror surveillance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Consent; Experiment; Privacy; Security; Surveillance"

Adolescents are vulnerable online because of a combination of their natural innocence, sensation-seeking drive coupled with the current digital media landscape and its manifold affordances for interactivity, immersive virtual environments and social networking. Adolescence is a time of transition in which youths progressively venture from the safety of the home to explore new opportunities. In this phase of life, both parents and peers play a critical role in either instigating or mitigating risky and dangerous activities. This study examines in the context of youth's online risky activities, whether the compensatory-competition model or the continuity-cognitive model prevails. This study also explores whether the engagement of parental mediation activities mitigates or compounds the situation. A Partial Least Squares Equation analysis of a stratified random survey of 2000 Malaysian school children between 13 and 15-year-old controlling for age and gender, found that peer-attachment competes with parent attachment for the influence of teenagers’ risky online activities and Internet addiction. Parental influence is stronger when parents actively engage in mediating the online activities of their teenagers. On balance, parents can have more influence on teenagers than their peers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Internet addiction; Malaysia; Parent attachment; Parental mediation; Peer attachment; Risky online activities"

We use elastic justification theory and consider diverse consumer risks to explain how movie consumers exhibit different behaviors for different movie channels when facing different degrees and types of risk. We classify the antecedents of movie selection into justifiable (risk-hedging) factors such as viewer rating, scenario familiarity, star power, and country of origin and unjustifiable (tempting and appealing) factors, including expert rating and genre. By considering various types and degrees of risk in each channel based on elastic justification theory, this study offers insights that should lead to more effective movie distribution across channels.

In an effort to offer a close experience with the product, websites usually present vivid information in order to convince consumers about the goodness of their products. Vivid information is likely to prompt different aspects of the purchase process, like reduced feelings of uncertainty or a higher need for physical information. The goal of this research is twofold: first, we analyze how the presence and type of vivid information, in the form of product presentation videos (PPVs), affects consumers’ attitudes and purchase intentions toward the product. Furthermore, we examine how the perceived ease of imagining the product evoked by vivid information mediates these effects. Second, we propose that individual differences, related to the consumer's need of touching products, determine the impact of vivid information on the preferences toward the purchase channel (online or offline). The results of an experiment, which manipulated the presence and the style of PPVs, support the importance of vivid information in order to favor consumers’ attitudes and purchase intentions, as well as to influence the relative preference for the purchase channel.

Text messaging is nowadays an important means of expressing affection and to feel close to one's partner. However, it is unclear if adding emoji to text messages influences perceptions about the relationship. In two experiments (combined N = 451), participants evaluated the relationship interest of a romantic partner, based on the messages exchanged. Study 1 compared positive and negative replies varying in emotional cues (without vs. text vs. emoji). Results showed that positive replies signaled the greatest interest, regardless of cue. In contrast, negative replies with (vs. without) cues signaled greater interest in the relationship and this was especially evident for messages with emoji. This benefit occurred because these messages were perceived as more positive (vs. negative messages without cue). Study 2 compared negative replies varying in the seriousness of the issue. Results showed that, for more serious replies, emotional text signaled greater interest by increasing message positivity. In contrast, emoji signaled less interest by increasing message negativity.

To treat post-stroke disability, cloud-based rehabilitation offers great advantages over conventional, clinic-based rehabilitation, providing ubiquitous flexible rehabilitation services and storage while offering therapeutic feedback from a therapist in real-time during patients' rehabilitative movements. With the development of sensory technologies, cloud computing technology integrated with Augmented Reality (AR) may make therapeutic exercises more enjoyable. To achieve these objectives, this paper proposes a framework for cloud-based rehabilitation services, which uses AR technology along with other sensory technologies. We have designed a prototype of the framework that uses the mechanism of sensor gloves to recognize gestures, detecting the real-time condition of a patient doing rehabilitative exercises. This prototype framework is tested on twelve patients not using sensor gloves and on four patients wearing sensor gloves over six weeks.

"The role of social support networks in proxy Internet use from the intergenerational solidarity perspective","2018","Telematics and Informatics","10.1016/j.tele.2017.12.005","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042285324&doi=10.1016%2fj.tele.2017.12.005&partnerID=40&md5=b60f466f703a9f58a2978b524b78de84","Digital inequalities research has documented a set of practices related to people's Internet use that questions the binary division between Internet users and non-users. In particular, among older adults, a considerably large group of individuals has been identified as not using the Internet by themselves; rather, they ask members of their personal networks to do things online for them—they “use” the Internet by proxy. Since previous research shows that children and grandchildren are important sources of help when it comes to Internet use, the current paper indicates that the notion of intergenerational solidarity is a sound conceptual basis for understanding the relationship between social support networks and proxy Internet use among Internet non-users. Notably, the concept of functional solidarity as a dimension of intergenerational solidarity is advanced, as this relates to the frequency of the intergenerational exchange of resources and services encompassing various types of assistance and support offered between two generations. Empirically, this paper investigates how the two types of social support networks and their characteristics are associated with proxy Internet use. The results from multivariate analyses of survey data from a nation-wide representative sample show that when comparing emotional support and socializing networks, only the latter is associated with proxy Internet use: Internet non-users who have (grand-)children in their socializing support network are more likely to engage in proxy Internet use. The results also indicate that non-users who are younger, more educated, have children, and live in urban areas are more inclined to engage in proxy Internet use, regardless of the type of social support. The findings indicate the importance of empirical investigation related to different aspects of functional solidarity, as the effects on proxy Internet use depend on the type of social support. © 2017","Digital inequality; Emotional support; Intergenerational solidarity; Proxy Internet use; Social support networks; Socializing support"

Most of the economic activities, trade, and foreign direct investment are mainly dependent on modern sources of ICT. The objective of present research work is to investigate the dynamic relationship between ICT, foreign direct investment (FDI), economic growth incorporating trade and globalization for BRICS economies over 2000–2014 by employing OLS with fixed effects, the FMOLS, the DOLS and the group-mean estimator techniques robust to heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence. Empirical results of the study suggest the long-run elasticities between ICT and economic growth, which suggests that ICT positively contributes to economic growth. Findings from long-run output elasticities show that both FDI and globalization have a long-run effect on economic growth. Furthermore, bi-directional causality exists between GDP and FDI, globalization and economic growth, and trade and economic growth. Also, unidirectional causality is running from globalization to trade. Globalization and ICT also Granger causes each other. Sensitivity analysis is employed to check whether findings of the study are valid and reliable for policy recommendation. The outcome of our study suggests policy recommendations for improving ICT with the focus on economic growth, trade openness and facilitation of foreign investment in BRICS countries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","BRICS; Economic growth; Globalization; ICT technology; Panel estimation"

As known for ICTs, network effect variables such as perceived network size and perceived complementarity are important for determining user loyalty. However, there is insufficient research on why they are determinants, i.e., knowing the underlying mechanism. Grounded in network effect and self-determination theories, we study such underlying mechanism. Based on an analysis of responses from an online survey of 292 participants using structural equation modelling, we find that the network effect variables of perceived network size and perceived complementarity are positively related to three user-perceived values, namely user-perceived functional, self-expressive, and social values. They are, in turn, positively related to satisfaction of the needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness, respectively, that further leads to user loyalty. This study contributes to the MIM literature by being the first to use the three user-perceived values and satisfaction of the three needs as novel process variables to construct a model for explaining the impacts of network effect variables on user loyalty to MIM apps. This study provides the insight that MIM providers can more effectively enhance user loyalty by providing the three values that users appreciate and satisfying the three needs, when increasing and advertising their network sizes and availability of complementary offerings. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Loyalty; Mobile instant messaging; Network effect; Satisfaction; Structural equation modeling; Survey"

They are either just surfing the platform or searching for information. Therefore, advertising content is vulnerable to ad avoidance. In this study, the effect of two Facebook ad placements, sidebar ads and message stream ads, on ad avoidance intention was investigated through an online experiment. Sidebar placements are put next to the content stream, while message stream advertising is interwoven with the original Facebook content. 253 Respondents (Mage = 39.4, SD = 8.7, 50.2% female) were given either a searching or surfing task. The intention of respondents to avoid ads placed in the message stream was significantly higher than to avoid ads placed in the sidebar. Through multiple moderation analysis, we found that Facebook motivations and product involvement were significant moderators of the effect of ad placement on ad avoidance intent. Our results point to the crucial role of the degree of product involvement when targeting Facebook ads to the right audience and choosing the appropriate ad placement.

The media equation theory posits that users’ responses to computer agents adhere to human-to-human social rules; hence, effective designs of embodied virtual agents should be based upon social psychology rules. One such rule is the notion of specialisation. While the concept of media specialisation in terms of TVs, computers, websites, web agents, smartphones, and voice assistants have been examined; no studies have yet to explore the effects of specialists and generalist embodied virtual agents in a multi-product category online store. To bridge this research gap, an experiment was conducted in which university undergraduates (n = 132) were randomly divided to interact with either a multi-product category website that incorporated specialist virtual agents or a multi-product category website that deployed a generalist virtual agent. Consistent with the hypotheses of this study, it was shown that the use of specialist virtual agents (as compared to a generalist virtual agent) enhanced perceptions of agent expertise, information credibility, website trust (ability, benevolence, integrity), and purchase intention. Meditation analyses revealed that the effects of agent specialisation on purchase intention were mediated by perceived virtual agent expertise, perceived information credibility, and website trust (ability, benevolence, integrity). Finally, the effects of agent specialisation were shown to be more evident for females than for males.

One not so well studied aspect of social media is analyzing its usage and efficacy in healthcare, particularly in developing countries which lack state-of-the-art healthcare systems and processes. In such countries, social media may be used to facilitate patient-centric healthcare by involving the patient for fulfilling personal healthcare needs. This article provides an in-depth analysis of one such need, that is, how people use social media to request for blood donations. We study the request and dissemination behavior of people using social media to fulfill blood donation requests. We focus on twitter, and blood donation accounts in India. Our study reveals that each of the seven twitter accounts we studied have a large followership of more than 35,000 users on an average and receive a substantial number (more than 900) of donation requests in a day on an average. We analyze the requests in various ways to present an outlook for healthcare providers to make their systems more patient-centric through a better understanding of the needs of people requesting for blood donations. Our study also identifies areas where future social media enabled automated healthcare systems can focus on the needs of individual patients. These systems can provide support for saving more lives by reducing the gap between blood donors and the people in need. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Blood donations; Patient-centric social healthcare; Social healthcare; Social media; Social media analytics; Social services; Twitter"

The aim of the current study was to examine the factors that influence peoples’ intentions to post digitally altered self-images on the Facebook platform, using an extended Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) model. It was hypothesised that after controlling for age, prior editing application use, and integration of Facebook in a user's life, the TPB variables (attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control [PBC]) would explain a significant proportion of intention to post digitally altered images on Facebook. Furthermore, that the addition of narcissism would explain further variation in intentions, beyond that explained by the control and TPB variables. Participants (N = 151; Mage = 25.6 years; 76% female) completed an online survey assessing each of the aforementioned variables. Hierarchical multiple regression revealed that each of the hypotheses were supported, with all variables significantly contributing to the prediction of intentions, except PBC and age.

The use of recently developed hybrid recommendation systems has helped overcome the main drawbacks of Content-Based Filtering (CBF) and Collaborative Filtering (CF). In hybrid recommendation systems that combine CF and CBF, the CF part uses two methods, including memory- and model-based approaches. Both approaches have some advantages and disadvantages for item recommendation. Sparsity has been one of the main difficulties associated with these approaches, whereas recommendation with high accuracy has been one of the important advantages of the memory-based approach. However, this approach is not scalable for current recommendation systems as their databases include huge numbers of items and users. In contrast, the model-based approach generates recommendations with low accuracy but is scalable for large databases in e-commerce recommender systems. Accordingly, to address this problem and take advantage of both approaches, in this work, we propose a new hybrid recommendation method and evaluate it using a real-world dataset. The aim is to improve efficiency and accuracy by designing a heuristic hybrid recommender method that combines memory-based and model-based approaches. Specifically, we use ontology in the CF part and improve ontology structure by eliminating uniformity of edges of the hierarchical relation between concepts (IS-A relation) in item ontology in the CBF part. Ontology structure is considered for improving accuracy; according to this, a new method for measuring semantic similarity that is more accurate than the traditional methods is presented. This new method can enhance the accuracy of CF and CBF in our method. In addition, the number of searches required to find similar clusters and neighbor users of the target user is decreased significantly using ontology, enhanced clustering and the new proposed algorithm. We evaluate the proposed method using a real-world dataset. The experimental results show that our method is more scalable and accurate than the benchmark k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and model-based recommendation methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Clustering; k-NN; Memory-based; Model-based; Ontology; Recommender systems"

The main aim is to introduce the system application at homes in a domestic scale. Design/methodology/approach: This research article covers the use of the 32-channel cost effective data acquisition device and its application software for the patient monitoring system. The design process includes knitting the sensors in the fiber to create a wearable fabric that can be fitted on a body for monitoring purposes. Findings: Human body temperature, oxygen level around the body, ECG, EMG muscle signal and PH level detection using 32-channel system with LabVIEW front panel control for alarm triggering. The monitoring can be done remotely. Data is connected to the hospital server. All the graphical interface and simulation is created using LabVIEW. This application can be alternatively viewed as a Human Impact System. Research limitations/implications: Digilent Chip KIT max32 is used since it rooms enough channel required for the interface software. Sensors such as ECG, EMG, Oxygen Pulse, PH and temp are knitted in the fiber of clothes to introduce a wear able fabric. The total of 32-channel is used by the complete application. Some channels are used for alerting in case, if the values from the sensors are abnormal. Practical implications: Chip KIT Shield for connecting sensors, attaching the output pins to the LED indicators and display have been created. Circuitry for measuring temperature, pulse, oxygen level, PH, EMG, and ECG have been designed and printed. This application can be used at home. For the wearer, the temperature level of different body parts, heart ECG level, muscle pulses signals, oxygen level around the body and the PH can be detected and displayed remotely from the LabVIEW front panel screen. The desired alarm level can be set from the front panel for every specific sensor. For this step, virtual channels can be created for allowing the user to set any random value for alarm depending on the patient age. These custom alarm levels are for user's own record, while the hospital works with the standard levels.

We found that, although there were no direct effects of social media use, social media indirectly contributed to polarization through increased political engagement. Those who actively used social network sites were more likely to engage in political processes, which led them to develop more extreme political attitudes over time than those who did not use social network sites. In particular, we observed a clear trend toward a more liberal direction among both politically neutral users and moderately liberal users. In this study, we highlight the role of social media in activating political participation, which eventually pushes the users toward the ideological poles.

Since a live-stream can also be interactive, it has some of the characteristics of a small community. People often become addicted to television, movies, or video blogs for the sake of entertainment. They can also become blind and obsessive about worshiping popular idols. Moreover, their willingness to use media is affected by their own perception of the media or their expectation of the benefits. This study therefore proposes four key factors: flow, entertainment, social interaction, and endorsement. We use path analysis to test their relationships with attitude, perceived value and watching intention to understand the influential factors and channels that induce audiences to watch live-streaming events. Analysis of 313 valid responses to a survey questionnaire indicate that approximately 65% of Taiwanese people watch live-streams via social network sites. In general, they watched live-streams simply because they liked to do so. The main reason behind their favorable impression of live-streaming was that live-streams made people happy and relieved stress. Secondly, people were attracted by the charm of the streamers, but the attraction differs slightly by gender. Females developed a more favorable impression of a live-stream when they admired the streamer. Males, on the other hand, developed a more favorable impression of a live-stream when they interacted with the streamer or other audience members. Young people tended to like live-streaming because it gave them a sense of flow, while older people were not affected by flow. This study contributes to the development of live-stream services and future studies on live-streaming. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Endorsement; Entertainment; Flow; Live-stream; Social interaction"

However, few studies have explored e-commerce logistics business models via big data analytics. Hence, this investigation explores e-commerce logistics business models from unstructured big data. Specifically, this work develops a hybrid content analytical model to scrutinize essential knowledge of e-commerce logistics. The empirical results of the proposed model incorporate theories of resource dependence theory (RDT) and innovation diffusion theory (IDT) to generate logistical strategies. Ten critical themes of e-commerce logistics from topic mining are “Southeast Asia's e-commerce logistics payments” “E-commerce order management” “E-commerce logistics cloud services” “E-commerce logistics package management” “Europe e-commerce trends” “India's e-commerce logistics” “E-commerce distribution management” “Tax policies” “E-commerce logistics platforms” and “E-commerce logistics networks”. Moreover, the fundamental rule of “cross-border e-commerce logistics” is uncovered by the association rules model. The proposed hybrid content analytics framework provides a research foundation for e-commerce logistics management. Furthermore, e-commerce logistics can be implemented by vital strategies: “Establish inter-organizational and technical collaboration to create positive operations performance” and “Comprehend law, policy, and cultural differences to customize appropriate technologies of e-commerce logistics”. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Big data analytics; Content analytics; E-commerce; Logistics management; Unstructured big data"

These SLM reports show Service Quality status in compare to Service Level Target (SLT) based on Service Level Agreement (SLA). However, producing Technical Service Reports (TSRs) for SLM has Data Quality (DQ) challenges when IT services of a large enterprise are outsourced to a large IT service provider (ITSP). In fact, sources of technical metrics in these reports are coming from huge, unverified and non-normalized system-generated events and logs in a large enterprise environment. In addition, there are lacks of configuration items and service information meta-data that are essential for producing these SLM reports. These challenges lead to low intrinsic and contextual DQ of reports that destroy customer's trust and management visibility which lead to Service Quality (SQ) issues and financial penalties. This research used Action Design Research (ADR) methodology and insider participant observation, focus group, interview and questionnaire data gathering and content analysis. Design, actions and data collection are done in and from a Multi-National Company (MNC) in Malaysia that provides IT services to one of the top 10 biggest enterprises in the world, during 4 years of research.

These trends have driven interest in the use of advanced healthcare information systems and telematics applications to improve care availability while reducing overall costs, but such measures require taking an integrated approach to a range of interrelated social, economic, political and cultural impacts and challenges. Telecare technologies allow hospitals to continuously monitor biomedical indicators, while providing patients with online services such as clinical appointment scheduling, medical consulting, remote alerts, etc. Telecare has the potential to transform the healthcare industry by reducing costs, increasing quality, and enhancing patient satisfaction. The development of a real-time monitoring healthcare service model through the integration of information and communications technologies (ICT) has emerged as a research priority. This study explores the design, value creation, development and evaluation of Telecare systems and mobile health applications for autonomous health management to ensure appropriate home-based health monitoring and treatment while improving care performance. A well-defined methodology is needed to develop artifacts due to increasing disease complexity. This study develops an Android-based self-management application based on design science research methodology. The App assists users in collecting and monitoring indicators to prompt appropriate care services. This study uses individual home self-care as the basic Telecare unit to design a service model integrating six kinds of healthcare services. Usability testing is conducted to reflect five constructs: system usefulness, ease of learning, information quality, interface quality, and overall satisfaction. Experimental results support previous research findings regarding the Chronic Care Model and enhance the effectiveness of mobile-based services.

Results demonstrate the mediating functions of political ambivalence in that exposure to proattitudinal news reduces ambivalence and thereby promotes political participation, whereas exposure to counter-attitudinal news increases ambivalence and thereby discourages participation. Importantly, the effect of exposure to counter-attitudinal news on ambivalence was moderated by heterogeneous discussion networks on social network sites, such that the combination of exposure to counter-attitudinal news and to heterogeneous discussion networks amplifies ambivalence additively, and thereby augments the tendency toward demobilization.

Very few literature on mobile phone use in indigenous communities in the Philippines has been written. Currently, there are no indigeneity-segregated data on mobile phone use in the country. Even mobile phone use in rural Philippines remains understudied. The country is home to 110 groups of indigenous peoples (IP) with 126 distinct languages and very diverse traditions and practices. The Cordillera mountain range in the northern part of the Philippines is recognized as the traditional domain of the Igorot, or people of the mountains. Its geopolitical location, the Cordillera Administrative Region, has one of the densest populations of indigenous peoples in the country. Under the label Igorot are a number of indigenous communities that has embraced the label as a form of resistance. The paper focuses on three indigenous communities in Mountain Province: (1) Barangay Laylaya, Besao, an Applai community that speaks the Western Kankana-ey language, the farthest with only one transport vehicle that leaves the village very early in the morning and returns late in the afternoon; (2) Payag-eo, Suyo, an Applai community that also speaks the Western Kankana-ey language; politically part of the tourist destination Sagada but is completely cut-off in terms of transport accessibility and is closer to the Bontok tribe geographically; and (3) Guina-ang, Bontoc, with people from the Bontok tribe who speaks iGuina-ang, one of the variations of the Bontok language, the village is an hour away from the provincial center where branches of national offices are housed and major trade activities take place. Guided by the culture-centered approach, an alternative lens built on the notion that understanding and negotiating meanings are embedded within cultural contexts and values, the paper looks into how mobile phones has affected, mediated, manifested and complicated the indigeneity of the Igorot. Specifically, it discusses how the indigenous social code inayan/nga-ag permeated the community's use of their mobile phones. From simple “Do not bring your mobile phones on the table.” to more morally imposing “Do not use your mobile phone for indecent and illicit acts.” This concept of inayan remains integral to the Igorot culture and is now intertwined with their use of their mobile phones. And as the Applai and Bontok Igorot struggle to keep their lifeways and traditions intact, the mobile phone continues to both facilitate this and at the same time get in the way. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Applai; Bontok; Culture-centered approach; Igorot; Inayan; Indigenous media; Indigenous peoples; Indigenous social code; Mobile phone taboo; Mobile phones"

The ACG industry is not an industry of a single country or region but a global industry. In addition to its own revenue, the derivative products (or licensed merchandise) of ACG can extend the ACG industry to win more business opportunities. The ACG industry is mainly marketed towards younger people, who are the major users of social network sites. Hence, the electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) on social network sites often becomes a reference basis of the young people's attitudinal acceptance and purchase intention in purchasing ACG-related derivative product.

Specifically, we analyze the factors that contribute to the gender digital divide in Rwanda. In addition, we assess the importance of equal access to ICTs between genders. Rwanda is a particulary interesting case study, since previous studies on gender differences in the usage and accessibility of ICTs have focused on Western countries, while Africa, and Rwanda in particular, have been less covered. The qualitative method of in-depth interviews was used to collect the data. Interviews were analyzed using a thematic analysis technique. The findings of this study reveal that a gender digital divide still exists in Rwanda, even though the government puts forth much effort to eradicate this phenomenon. Reasons for barriers for women's access to ICTs were found in social, economic and cultural factors, such as feelings of lack of self-worth, self-confidence, and proper educations; heavy domestic responsibilities; and computer anxiety. The findings also indicated that equal access to ICTs would be a shortcut to economic growth in Rwanda.

In order to encourage the adoption of cloud services, it is considerable to understand an important and particular complications regarding to cloud computing is the potential and perceived security risks and benefits posed by implementing such technology. This paper investigates the critical security factors that influence the decision to adopt cloud computing by Saudi government agencies. A framework was proposed for three categories, Social Factors category, Cloud Security Risks Category and Perceived Cloud Security Benefits that includes well-known cloud security features. The framework factors were identified by critically reviewing studies found in the literature together with factors from the industrial standards within the context of Saudi Arabia. An experiment study was conducted in five government agencies in Saudi Arabia by interview and questionnaire with experts in order to improve and confirm the framework. All the factors in the proposed framework were found to be statistically significant. An additional factor identified was Failure of client side encryption. Moreover, they suggested including this factor as a potential risk under Security Risk Factors Category. The initial framework was updated based on the expert reviews and questionnaires. The results were analysed via one-sample t-test with the data integrity analysed via Cronbach's alpha. The outcome indicated the majority of cloud security adoption framework categories were statistically significant.

We proposed a method to label automatically mobile apps in terms of whether and to what extent they can satisfy users’ particular psychological needs. First, using the grounded theory approach, we conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews to identify types of needs associated with app usage. Substantive and theoretical coding of the data from the interviews as well as data from samples of app reviews yielded eight types of psychological needs app users had: utilitarian, low-cost, security, health, hedonic, social, cognitive, and self-actualization needs. Second, using the needs corpus (words and phrases) generated above, a classifier was trained using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms to filter reviews in terms of whether they included needs-related comments. The classifier showed good performance. Finally, Labeled-LDA was used to automatically provide each review with multiple labels of the types of needs mentioned and the apps were analyzed for the different types of needs they satisfied. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Grounded theory; Machine learning algorithms; Mobile apps; Psychological needs; Reviews"

Using the case of the Italian digital agency, the research amplifies the scope of the current discussions on national e-Government trajectories, providing evidence for the interrelated dynamics between policy outcomes, implementation mechanisms and administrative landscape. The article shows that the discontinuity of Italy's Digital Agenda is attributable to the merry-go-round nature of governments with divergent views of modernization – resulting in the digital agency's multiple, even conflicting mandates – and to the misalignment of the ‘original agency model’ with the embedded culture of the public machinery.

Due to Bitcoin's growing popular appeal and merchant acceptance, it has become increasingly important to try to understand the factors that influence its value formation. Presently, the value of all bitcoins in existence represent approximately $7 billion, and more than $60 million of notional value changes hands each day. Having grown rapidly over the past few years, there is now a developing but vibrant marketplace for bitcoin, and a recognition of digital currencies as an emerging asset class. Not only is there a listed and over-the-counter market for bitcoin and other digital currencies, but also an emergent derivatives market. As such, the ability to value bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies is becoming critical to its establishment as a legitimate financial asset. Using cross-sectional empirical data examining 66 of the most widely used cryptocurrencies, a regression model was estimated that points to three main drivers of cryptocurrency value: the level of competition in the network of producers, the rate of unit production, and the difficulty of algorithm used to “mine” for the cryptocurrency. These amount to relative differences in the cost of production of one digital currency over another at the margin, pointing to differences in relative cost of production – electricity goes in, cryptocurrency comes out. Using that as a starting point, a no-arbitrage situation is established for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies followed by the formalization of a cost of production model to determine the fair value of a bitcoin. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Altcoins; Asset pricing; Bitcoin; Blockchain; Cryptocurrencies; Digital currencies"

Non-governmental organizations demonstrate higher compliance level compared to government-owned organizations. Despite differences in the compliance scores, most organizations fail to meet the requirements of the PDPA. Our study also reveals that readability has a negative correlation with the compliance score because simple and shorter version of the privacy policies often lack detailed information.

Among many embedded communication tools in SNS, our study focuses on fan pages and page followers, highlighting their continuous visiting behavior to company fan pages in the context of Facebook. Based on uncertainty reduction theory, our study proposes a research model examining the relationship between uncertainty reduction strategies and continuous visiting behavior, mediated by the low level of uncertainty. In addition, we employ the perceived usefulness of postings on fan pages as a mediator between uncertainty and visiting behavior. Lastly, we adopt two moderating factors: SNS satisfaction and SNS loyalty. To test hypotheses, we analyzed survey data from 189 Facebook users who have subscribed to at least one fan page on Facebook using a partial least squares (PLS) method. We found that uncertainty reduction strategies are positively associated with a low level of uncertainty about information regarding products or services on fan pages. In addition, perceived usefulness of postings is significantly accounted for by the low level of uncertainty. Both the low level of uncertainty and usefulness of postings explain continuous visiting behavior jointly. Our research findings also revealed that SNS satisfaction and SNS loyalty have significant moderating effects on the relationships between the low level of uncertainty/perceived usefulness and continuous visiting behavior.

New media scholars have coined the term “intensity of Facebook use” (IFU) for the concept that measures the emotional and affective attitude towards Facebook use among young people. IFU is an important service use concept that has been positively linked with the different psychosocial outcomes of student well-being. However, only a limited amount of the prior literature has investigated the relationship between IFU and different Facebook uses and gratifications (U&G). The existing literature suggests inconsistent findings with a sole emphasis on young adults. To address these gaps, the present study has investigated the differential role of different Facebook U&G among adolescents and young adults in predicting IFU. A total of three cross-sectional data sets (N = 373, 107, 105) represented adolescents and university-attending young-adult Facebook users. The study results suggest that process U&G do and content U&G do not play any significant role in predicting IFU. Adolescents and young adults differ in their sought Facebook U&G.

The present study investigated whether and how online health information and virality metrics associated with social media platforms jointly shape persuasive outcomes in the context of cancer screening promotion. One important area of research on cancer screening promotion concerns loss-versus-gain message framing, which has highlighted the persuasive advantage of loss framing relative to gain framing. Given this, we examined how social media virality metrics, loss-versus-gain message framing, and perceived susceptibility influence message-evoked fear and intention to perform colonoscopy in the context of colorectal cancer screening. Results from an online experiment showed that loss framing, relative to gain framing, led to greater message-evoked fear when the message was presented with high-virality metrics, and this pattern was particularly pronounced among those with low perceived susceptibility to colorectal cancer. Furthermore, a formal test of moderated mediation showed that the indirect effect of loss framing on colonoscopy intention through message-evoked fear was significantly moderated by perceived susceptibility to colorectal cancer when the message was presented with high-virality metrics.

We use the framework to guide the design, implementation, and evaluation of ICT for education (ICTE) artifacts in Haiti. To understand the contextual factors influencing participant's intentions to use ITCE, we develop an integrated theoretical model that draws upon a popular information systems (IS) theory (UTAUT) and a behavior change model (HBM) from the public health domain. Data from 222 users is used to assess individual perceptions of ICTE benefits and barriers, and personal motivations to use ICTE. Compared to UTAUT, the results of our model better explain variations in behavior intentions of ICTE use. For practitioners, the study offers insights on what drives ICT use in LDCs. For researchers, the study generates discussion on the importance of understanding interdependencies between technology and development context. We argue that understanding these interdependencies are crucial if ICT4D interventions are to be meaningful and impactful. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Citizen-centric capacity development (CCD) framework; Haiti; ICT Usage; ICT4D; ICTE"

How do these older adults view this technology? What are their communication needs and expectations and why are they drawn to it? To address these questions and fill a gap in the literature, this study draws upon in-depth interviews with 46 older adults (average age: 80.4 years) about their perceptions of Facebook, which was the leading SNS at the time of writing. Analysis of interview data revealed six primary reasons for using Facebook (keeping in touch, sharing photos, social surveillance, responding to family member requests, convenient communication, curiosity) and six primary reasons for not using Facebook (privacy, need for media richness, preference for familiarity, triviality of communication, time commitment, frustration with site tools). Emergent findings hold implications for future research and SNS design. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","In-depth interview; Older adults; Social networking sites; Uses and gratifications"

Prior empirical studies have for the most part employed social influence theory to investigate user intentions to continue with social media, while culture driven theories have been neglected. Rather than using social influence theory, we introduced guanxi theory to explore how guanxi social mechanisms (or processes) influence Chinese users’ continuance intentions in WeChat. Specifically, we developed a model that examines the role of guanxi as manifested by renqing, mianzi and ganqing in perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment and continuance intention in WeChat. A survey research method was adopted to test the proposed hypotheses. This study found that ganqing has a positive impact on perceived usefulness and continuance intention. Mianzi exerts a negative effect on continuance intention but exhibits a positive effect on perceived usefulness. Renqing was found to have no significant impact on perceived usefulness and continuance intention. Our study advances the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by introducing guanxi-based constructs in a Chinese mobile social-messaging application context. Our study also offers alternative insights on guanxi-based social influence processes in the Chinese technology acceptance literature. © 2017 The Authors","Ganqing; Guanxi; Mianzi; Renqing; Social media; Technology acceptance"

This is done by estimating econometrically a model of CC adoption propensity containing measures of the four main adoption motives mentioned above besides further variables that are associated with technology adoption and a series of controls for firm size, sector and country affiliation. Our study is based on a dataset collected through the e-Business W@tch Survey of the European Commission from 556 European firms from the glass, ceramic and cement sectors. These findings indicate that Southern European firms are mainly oriented towards ‘first-level’ cost (and especially investment) reduction related benefits from CC as well as from new emerging ICT, while on the contrary Northern European firms are mainly oriented towards ‘second-level’ transformation related benefits from CC, which are associated with support and facilitation of innovation and external collaboration. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cloud computing; Technology adoption"

However, few have investigated least developed countries (LDCs). Of those that have, their findings tend to be descriptive in nature – falling short of a theoretical contribution grounded in the sociocultural context. The purpose of this paper is to provide a theoretical analysis of E-Commerce adoption in an LDC, Tanzania. Specifically, the study seeks to identify structural practices associated with E-Commerce in Tanzanian SMEs. Using structuration theory and following an interpretivist stance the findings show that Tanzanian SMEs enact three major E-Commerce structural practices: (1) Marketing and image-building through use of websites, (2) Transacting through extensive use of mobile technology (3) Technical problem-solving through establishing partnerships. These practices are informed by organisational and environmental factors that define the sociocultural, technological and economic contextual setting. Considerable evidence is found that SMEs use websites in a limited way, as they draw upon their understanding of websites as being incompatible with the Tanzanian cultural bargaining system, which is characterised by cash transactions and face to face bargaining. Websites are viewed primarily as a platform from which SMEs can portray a sophisticated image and advertise/market their products. SMEs use mobile technology extensively, as they draw on the technology's ability to offer transactive capability, mobility and communication. Findings also point to technological challenges which SMEs face from the environment, mainly from a lack of supporting industry and institutional support. SMEs hence establish partnerships with international organisations that can support them in overcoming technological challenges. Partnerships with large ICT organisations require stringent conditions, such as the requirement for SMEs to have certification in order to be affiliated. The study gives practitioners a better understanding of how SMEs perceive E-Commerce in Tanzania amidst organisational and environmental opportunities and constraints, and in so doing practitioners can better design appropriate E-Commerce context-specific policies and interventions that address SME problems. This will ensure that available resources become utilised in a more effective manner without negative consequences. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","E-Commerce; SMEs; Structuration theory; Tanzania"

However, consumers may inappropriately subscribe to such a flat rate because other usage-dependent price schemes are available which more closely match with their MCS use patterns. Surprisingly, little research has examined how the degree of consumer tariff misfit is correlated with socio-demographic, contract-, MCS-usage- and device-related subscriber characteristics. The present paper analyzes such associations. We develop two volume-based measures of the degree of tariff misfit in a sample of 1,274 subscribers of an MNO in Germany who had switched into a “grand flat rate” which includes unlimited national call minutes, mobile Internet traffic as well as national SMS. We find that the degree of tariff misfit is significantly higher among subscribers who are older, live in West Germany, have a longer MNO tenure, have larger monthly usage volume variations of voice calls, mobile Internet and SMS and are equipped with a device which is not an Apple iPhone. Implications of the results are discussed for MNO practitioners and for future scholarly work. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Degree of tariff misfit; Flat rates; Mobile communication service usage; Rate plan suitability"

Newspaper and anecdotal evidence in Nigeria suggest that consumers view such advertisements pejoratively since they are usually unsolicited. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to use phenomenological design and semi-structured interviews to empirically examine consumers’ experiences as recipients of unsolicited phone call-based mobile advertising and efforts they have made thus far in addressing the issue. Twelve mobile subscribers (six males and six females) within the ages of 25 and 49 years participated in the study. Thematic analysis of the interviews revealed that consumers are generally resentful about unsolicited phone call-based mobile advertising. They may, however, be receptive to such advertising depending on whether they are informative and entertaining, permitted, and personalised to suit their mood, time, and context. Also, some consumers have not attempted to address the issue of unsolicited phone call-based mobile advertising whereas those that have tried before are reluctant in doing so again since previous attempts were unsuccessful. The implications of these findings to consumer satisfaction in telecoms sector in Nigeria were discussed. It was recommended that telecoms network operators in Nigeria should allow consumers to make their own choice and also consider consumers’ personal interests and preferences when designing mobile advertisements. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Advertisements; Attitudes toward mobile advertising; Consumers; Mobile advertisements; Mobile advertising; Nigeria; Unsolicited phone call-based mobile advertising"

Makerspace sustainability is a significant issue as diminished participation, activity, utilization, and retention limit its success. This study examines makerspace sustainability by understanding which factors influence makerspace continuance intention. This study proposes and empirically tests a conceptual framework based on self-determination theory to identify the motivations of makerspace users. An analysis of data collected from 121 South Korean makerspace users indicates that makerspace environmental support is significantly related to a makerspace user's basic psychological needs. Those psychological needs positively impact intrinsic motivation, which ultimately influences makerspace continuance intention. This research has several implications for academics while recommendations are proposed that have immediate application for practitioners which are informed by the study results. © 2017","Continuance intention; Environmental support; Innovation; Intrinsic motivation; Makerspace; Self-determination"

This paper documents our experience and presents our findings from a 25-day long project, which took place in Zagori, northwestern Greece. 11 high school students from Portugal designed and manufactured natural and cultural heritage artifacts carrying messages in the Braille language. The objects were then handed to people with visual impairments with a twofold aim. First, to enable the communication among persons with and without visual impairments; and, second, to empower students to participate in training projects through open educational procedures. We conclude that open educational practices can boost students’ active engagement in educational processes. Finally, 3D printing encourages a meaningful communication among people with and without visual impairments via the tangible exploration of geocultural components. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; Collaboration; Constructionism; Non-formal education; Open-source; Participatory action research"

Relatedly, we also examine the impact of broadband penetration on economic growth and the possible growth drivers. We find that while broadband policies improve fixed broadband penetration, 3G/4G services improve mobile broadband penetration; the magnitude of the latter being nearly three-times that of the former. Besides, we also uncover a positive effect of broadband penetration on economic growth, primarily working through a reduction in broadband prices and well as greater innovation and entrepreneurial activity. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Broadband penetration; Broadband policies; Economic growth; MENA"

Primary, lower secondary and high school teachers can have a significant impact on the e-safety of children and youngsters by raising their awareness of the risks associated with the use of technologies. Technical e-safety has roughly been acknowledged as an area where interpersonal relationships are not prioritised. A qualitative analysis of open-coded in-depth interviews with ICT teachers using the Grounded Theory method identified determinants that influence teachers’ knowledge and routines and a model of formation was developed. Firstly, there are external and internal influences. Another factor is teachers’ attitudes to e-safety rules that should support safe behaviour. Thirdly, teachers have barriers to protection in their minds and these could hinder their safe behaviour. Previous negative experiences have also been identified as another significant factor that affects a teacher's e-safety habits. The developed theory describes causal and intervening relationships between the given categories. The developed theory will serve as a basis for proposing steps to improve ICT teachers’ knowledge of e-safety and ways teacher education might be adapted to achieve that. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","e-Safety; e-Safety behaviour; ICT teacher; Routine"

In theory, ICT is among the sources contributing to the increasing levels of CO2 emissions in terms of production of ICT machinery and devices, energy consumption, and recycling of electronic waste. However, ICT is also expected to reduce CO2 emissions on a global scale by developing smarter cities, transportation systems, electrical grids, industrial processes, and energy saving gains. These two effects work in opposite direction, creating an inverted-U relationship between ICT and CO2 emissions. The aim of this study is to investigate this non-linear relationship between ICT and CO2 emissions on a global scale. Given that global warming is a global issue, it is necessary to look at this relationship in countries at all levels of development. To this end, we use a panel data set consisting of 142 economies, split into 116 developing and 26 developed countries, over the period 1995–2010. The results of our empirical study confirm that the relationship between ICT and CO2 emissions is an inverted U-shaped relationship. Moreover, while for the sample of developing countries, the ICT turning point is well above the mean value, the opposite is true for the sample of developed countries. This implies that many developed countries have already attained the level of ICT development, at which CO2 emissions decreases as the level of ICT development improves further. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; Developed economies; Developing economies; Environmental Kuznets curve; ICT; Panel data"

These companies have fewer tangible assets and capital, and therefore, the efficient delivery of services and products is a key business priority for them. Customer relationship management (CRM) technologies, which are designed to facilitate customer engagement during the design, development and delivery of services and products may play a significant role in the success or failure of start-up companies. Developments in new communication technologies have transformed traditional CRM into electronic CRM (eCRM), mobile CRM (mCRM); and more recently, social CRM (SCRM). However, there remains very little understanding of the factors affecting SCRM adoption in start-up businesses. The relative newness of SCRM technologies, coupled with the swiftly evolving nature of start-up companies: which has made them difficult cases to study – has limited the amount of research undertaken in this area. This paper aims to close this gap by proposing a framework that depicts the factors affecting start-up companies’ intention to adopt SCRM applications, and explores the relative importance of these factors. Inspired by an extended Technological, Organisational and Environmental (TOE) framework, this paper investigates effects of technological characteristics (TC), organisational characteristics (OC), environmental characteristics (EC) and managerial characteristics (MC) on start-up companies’ intentions to adopt SCRM applications. The results outlined in this research indicate that the observability, compatibility and trialability of SCRM solutions positively affect SCRM adoption in start-up businesses. Moreover, the availability of internal financial resources has a similarly positive effect. When considering environmental characteristics, it was found that support from venture capitalists, crowd funding support, governmental support, business angels support and external pressure all positively affect the intention to adopt SCRM applications within start-up businesses. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","DOI; SCRM adoption; Social customer relationship management; Start-up business"

This study investigates how the limitations of the smartwatch are related to perceptual discomforts. Theoretically, this study evaluates the claim that the discomfort that users appear to have with the smartwatch stem from failed remediation. Users perceive the smartwatch more as a set of functional sensors rather than a watch or smartphone. Specifically, from the remediation perspective, the authors asked how users perceive the functions of the smartwatch. This study used dynamic topic modeling for topics on the smartwatch on Reddit. This study reports that the smartwatch has failed to provide a proper way to use the remediated content that it provides.

At the same time, relatively little research has addressed the specific persuasive outcomes that organizations could accrue by using Twitter to communicate with the public in a more dialogic way. We investigated the persuasive effect of an organization's dialogic retweeting (conceptualized as retweeting of user mentions addressed to the organization) by drawing on the concept of social presence and the theory of reasoned action. In an online experiment conducted with an adult sample of U.S. Twitter users, participants were randomly assigned to view either a fictitious organization's dialogic retweets or the same organization's monologic tweets of identical content. We found that the dialogic retweets, when compared to the monologic tweets from the organization, induced a higher level of social presence, which, in turn, led to a higher level of subjective norms, more favorable attitudes toward the behavior advocated by the organization in the messages, and greater intention to adopt the behavior.

The learning process is one of the activities on which emotions have a direct influence. Thus, understanding the manner in which emotions change the students’ learning process is not only very important but it can also allow to improve the existing learning models. Currently, in the majority of situations, the teacher serves as a facilitator between the student and the learning course, and through a constant analysis of the student's behaviour, emotions and achievements, he constantly performs adjustments to the teaching process in order to meet the students’ needs and goals. Thus far, in online learning environments there is no easy way for teachers to analyse students’ behaviour and emotions. A possible solution to this problem can be the development of mechanisms that enable computers to automatically detect students’ emotions and adapt the learning process in order to meet students’ real needs. An emotional learning model was described and a software prototype was developed and tested, in order to find out whether it performs live identification of the students’ emotions, by using affective computing techniques, and whether it automatically performs adjustments to their individual learning process. Through a deeper analysis and multidisciplinary discussion of the achieved results it is possible to acknowledge that not only emotions impact students’ learning, but also that an application that performs live emotion recognition and which integrates this feature with adjustable online learning environments will trigger improvements in students’ learning. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive learning environments; Affective computing; Emotion recognition; Emotional learning; Learning styles"

In a first stage, this paper presents a literature review with a careful analysis of book samples, thesis, dissertations and articles from this field of expertise, and identifies the specificities of local governments, as well as quality assessment approaches to traditional, electronic, and e-Government services. This literature review allowed us, simultaneously, to identify a list of dimensions that evaluate the local context. To better understand the specificities of local authorities and complete the list of dimensions collected from our literature review, we carried out an empirical study based on 21 interviews with local government experts. From this evidence collection and analysis we identified 30 dimensions that specifically evaluate local government online services. The next step consisted in submitting this list to a Delphi Method process, to validate, add, remove or expand dimensions and domains. This method allowed us to reach a consensus in two rounds and counted with the participation of 44 experts. As a result of the Delphi Method process, a specific model comprised by 32 dimensions (assessment criteria) divided in four areas was developed for the assessment of local government online services. Finally, to validate the model, 255 users who had previously requested and completed a local online service (from request to payment) at the Municipality of Penacova used our web tool. In short, the results obtained from the selected sample indicate that the measuring tool used in the developed model is consistent, measures and discriminate the quality of the online services provided by local governments. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","e-Government; e-Services; Local government; Online services; Public services; Quality of service"

However, limited research focuses on the context of humanitarian supply chains. This calls to develop structural models that can scrutinize the technology adoption behaviour of the users in the humanitarian context. Therefore, this study is an attempt to empirically examine the technology adoption behaviour of humanitarian organizations. It extends the unified theory of the acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model by integrating personal innovativeness and trust in technology with the behavioural intention to adopt technology in the humanitarian context. Data from 192 humanitarian practitioners, who have experienced a large number of disasters, is utilized to empirically validate the conceptual model. The structural equation modelling results show that - out of four constructs namely performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions under UTAUT - performance expectancy and effort expectancy significantly affect the IT adoption. Contrary to expectations, trust and personal innovation do not affect the behavioural intention. Also, personal innovation does not moderate the relationship between performance expectancy and effort expectancy. This underlines the need to foster a learning culture within these organizations. The efforts made by involved humanitarian organizations may be directed towards improving the level of education, skills and facilitating them with other resources such as appropriate IT and data mining training, so that the technology adoption becomes an integral part of their daily activities. Finally, detailed implications for humanitarian organizations are discussed. © 2017","Humanitarian logistics; Humanitarian supply chain management; Information technology; Supply chain management; Technology adoption; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology"

Results of the survey (N = 260) indicated that after controlling for overall social media use and demographic factors (i.e., age, gender), narcissism significantly predicted the frequency of posting solo selfies and editing selfies. Age moderated the relationship between narcissism and the frequency of posting group selfies. Posting group selfies was predicted by extraversion and agreeableness and the need for popularity. The need for popularity also predicted the frequency of posting solo selfies, but not of selfie editing. Furthermore, findings revealed that gender moderated the relationship between the need for popularity and posting solo selfies, such that the need for popularity predicted posting solo selfies among men, but not among women.

The current study examines the effects of consumers’ domain-specific innovativeness (DSI) on the adoption of wearable technology. In this study, consumer DSI is first conceptualized to have two dimensions namely, product-possessing innovativeness (PPI) and information-possessing innovativeness (IPI). The effects of PPI and IPI on perceived attributes of wearable technology (relative advantage, social image, aesthetics, and novelty) are then examined, which influence purchase intention. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on a survey data from young consumers. Structural equation modeling was employed to evaluate the proposed research model. Results demonstrate that 1) the DSI construct must be examined in the two dimensions so that it can properly measure the nature and characteristics of DSI, 2) IPI plays an important role, having a positive effect on all four perceived attributes of IT innovations, 3) PPI has a positive effect on perceived social image and perceived novelty, and finally 4) all perceived attributes of IT innovations have a positive effect on consumers’ purchase intention of wearable devices.

The purposes of this study are to examine the influence of anxious attachment and relational embeddedness on trust and to investigate the impact of trust and co-production on performance in the context of online seller-shopping platform relationships. Design/methodology/approach: The research is an empirical research using data collected from 308 senior marketing managers of online stores selling products/services in two largest online shopping platforms. Structure equation modeling was employed to verify and validate the research model. Findings: The outcomes confirm that online sellers’ anxious attachment plays a key role and is negatively associated with their trust in the online shopping platform. Relational embeddedness positively affects trust of online sellers in the online shopping platform. The effect of trust on co-production and the influence of co-production on performance are statistically significant. However, trust does not appear to positively influence performance. Research limitations/implications: This study surveyed targeted online sellers in Taiwan and the research outcomes may not be generalized to other countries. Practical implications: The research results provide insights for the online shopping platform in understanding online sellers’ attachment anxiety and developing relational bonds with them to generate a favorable partnership. Originality/value: This study represents one of the few that empirically examines the role of anxious attachment in online business-to-business partnerships and the findings provide useful information for the online shopping platform to improve customers’ trust and participation. © 2017","Anxious attachment; Co-production; Performance; Relational embeddedness; Trust"

Some studies have indicated that comprehension in the two media is equivalent, while other research has questioned this conclusion. Furthermore, we have little systematic knowledge about students’ own attitudes and practices regarding reading in hardcopy versus onscreen. The present investigation gathered quantitative and qualitative survey data from 429 university students in the US, Japan, Germany, Slovakia, and India. The quantitative findings revealed high levels of affirmation about advantages of reading in print. Nearly 92% said they concentrated best when reading in print, and more than four-fifths reported that if cost were the same, they would prefer print for both schoolwork and pleasure reading. Students reported they were more likely to re-read printed material than digital; they were also more likely to multitask when reading onscreen. Qualitative questions asked what students liked most and liked least about reading in hardcopy and reading digitally. Using a fine-grained coding scheme, these responses were quantified. Advantages reported for print included ease of annotation and paper's tactile properties, while among the disadvantages were lack of convenience and expenditure of environmental or monetary resources. The biggest advantage of screen reading was convenience, while the primary disadvantages were eyestrain and distraction. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Concentration; Digital reading; Higher education; Print reading; Student preferences"

However, the literature on ICT adoption—from selection to implementation—has not been well integrated into leadership theory. This is particularly true in terms of adoption. Leaders must adopt ICTs not only for their own competence—an antecedent condition for what is considered e-leadership, but choose, recommend, and support implementation of ICTs for their organizations/units to use. Leaders are also expected to become effective in dealing and navigating the challenges of leading within the digital space. At this moment, there are two pertinent literatures: the technology adoption literature and the enterprise resource planning literature—which can be considered an important special case of leadership change management literature—and which could provide the theoretical basis for developing a unified theoretical perspective on e-leadership.

The adaptation causes the existence of varied approaches which are addressing the collaborative learning techniques. As a result, there is a need for a mechanism to study those approaches and highlight their eminence. The aim of this paper is to give a comprehensive overview about the state-of-art in collaborative learning, especially by integrating social media tools. To do so, the study adopts a classification framework based on four different views (subject, purpose, method, and tool). The framework has been used to compare ten collaborative e-learning approaches. The finding indicates the potential of all approaches in developing an online learning environment for remote collaborative learning despite the lack of fulfilling all the requirements highlighted in the four views. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Classification framework; Collaborative learning; Social media"

This empowerment of users could also favor the development of their skills and strategies to deal with online advertising, which may result in a lower advertising effectiveness. A study with 286 YouTube users was carried out to investigate this adaptation process to an advertising format by focusing on pre-roll skippable video ads. In contrast to advertisers’ approach (e.g. improving the persuasiveness of the ad), our research deepens on the ad skipping phenomenon from a human and context based perspective. In favor of an ad avoidance training effect, the findings show that participants previously exposed to a skippable ad are faster in taking the decision to watch or skip a subsequent ad. Participants’ skipping habits and time urgency are also revealed as main determinants of different ad skipping behaviors.

The Korean government has prohibited mobile network providers from providing excessive subsidies for mobile handsets to attract subscribers since Nov. 2014 according to the mobile act. Using the exogenous variation, we estimate the impact of the policy on the intention to change handsets and expenses on handset installment, total mobile communications, and online content. The longitudinal data are from the 2014 to 2015 waves of the Korea Media Panel Survey. The mobile act lowered the predicted probability of switching handsets by 0.4% points. Moreover, the mobile act increased the predicted probability of any expense on handset installment by 7.5% points and had a significant impact on the amount of expenses on handset installment, with an increase of 7.8%. The mobile act lowered users’ willingness to switch handsets and increased spending on handset installment. This increased burden in handset installment might shrink the online content market, which has a large need for government support, as well as decrease consumers’ welfare. We assert that the policy intervention on handset subsidies is questionable with regard to both consumer welfare and the healthiness of the ICT ecosystem. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer surplus; Handset subsidy; ICT ecosystem; Mobile communication; Policy intervention"

Findings highlight the direct and indirect effect of social camaraderie, subjective norm, fan emotion and purposive needs on sport consumers’ satisfaction and behavioral intention. The behavioral intention of consumers when using Facebook as a second screen was associated with the increased likelihood of using the platform to purchase team products, make recommendations and investigate sponsors. The proposed model contributes to the emerging literature highlighting the increasing importance of social media as an interactive support channel when people watch live telecasts.

In this paper, the technical efficiency (TE) of the Korean information and communication technology (ICT) industry is estimated through stochastic frontier analysis, and the efficiencies from 2000 to 2013 are compared through meta-frontier analysis. In addition, by analyzing the effect of innovations that move the production function up on the TE and the meta-frontier efficiency through the two-stage least square model, this paper investigates the effects of innovation on other companies in the industry in the short- and long-term and how the industry evolves accordingly. As a result, sudden inflation of the meta-technology ratio caused by a few innovative firms automatically lowers the average TE. However, the innovation spills over intra-industry by the efforts of other firms trying to reach around the innovation (i.e., imitation). This recovers other firms’ TE and increases meta-frontier efficiency. In addition, this paper provides theoretical and practical implications of the results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Industry evolution; Information and communication technology; Innovation; Meta-frontier analysis; Spillover; Technical efficiency"

Therefore, retaining existing consumers has been a challenging task for smartphone manufacturer brands. Given the status quo in smartphone industry and deficiencies in smartphone research, this study proposes a model that integrates Expectation Confirmation Model and brand attachment to shed light on smartphone repurchase decision making process. Besides, gender differences are also accounted for in the model. This study employs a two-staged approach, namely PLS-ANN, in analysing the data collected from 510 existing smartphone owners. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was firstly engaged, and followed by artificial neural network analysis. Besides, a non-parametric partial least squares multi-group analysis has also been conducted to discover gender differences in such decision making process. The results suggest that brand attachment is the most influential and relevant driver of consumers’ intention to repurchase smartphones from current brand (measured by continuance intention). Moreover, male consumers are more sensitive to the influence of brand attachment in developing their satisfaction and continuance intention, while female consumers are relying more on perceived usefulness. Interestingly, perceived usefulness does not significantly influence male consumers in continuance intention development. Practical and theoretical implications are subsequently offered. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial neural network analysis (ANN); Brand attachment; Gender differences; Partial least squares multi-group analysis (PLS-MGA); Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM); Smartphone repurchase intention"

The retailers recognize the importance of the mobile channel as an efficient sales channel and as a tool for CRM (Customer Relationship Management). However, CRM has become increasingly complex after adopting it to the mobile channel. It is imperative for retailers to understand consumer behavior in an omni-channel circumstance. Using the four-year transaction data obtained from the online home-shopping provider that expanded its online service (telephone, ARS, Internet website) onto a mobile platform, this research analyzes the consumer channel choice behavior in the perspectives of consumer sociodemographic information, consumer behavior, and corporate communication strategies. To explain channel choices in the omni-channel environment, we use multivariate probit model with sociodemographic variables, communication strategies, order hour, and product categories. Our empirical results indicate that age and gender have significant influences on channel choice behavior. Consumer fixates their inflow channel. Communication strategies such as SMS and app push alarm significantly influence consumer channel choice. Consumers using mobile channel are making purchases without time constraints, while others not. We observed that products that have characteristics of experience goods or credence goods tend to be purchased via mobile and Internet channels that provide detailed and additive information like consumer reviews. Finally, the results revealed substitution effect between most of the channels, except for the Internet and telephone.

In this respect, it leverages a set of open and credible indicators of both technological and economic character and attempts to reflect on the effects of the crisis on ICT or conversely seen the potential of the latter to enable the affected countries to come out of the crisis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Digital; Economic crisis; Europe; Financial crisis; GDP; ICT; Index of Real Costs; Indicator; Innovation; Mediterranean countries; Technology"
"Impacts of subsidy regulation on the mobile market in Korea : Major provider's diversification of handset quality","2017","Telematics and Informatics","10.1016/j.tele.2016.12.005","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007490295&doi=10.1016%2fj.tele.2016.12.005&partnerID=40&md5=89dfa24fa846e2ef70944af4273ccf73","In the mobile service market, operators competitively engage in price discrimination of a bundle of handset and service over customers who have their switching costs and are locked-in under a long-term contract in return for subsidizing the handset. This paper is motivated by a recent legislation enacted in Korea (Mobile Device Distribution Improvement Act) that bans price discrimination with handset subsidy. We study the impacts of subsidy regulation on equilibrium prices, profit, and average revenue per user (ARPU) in a game approach. We set up an integrated model of price and quality competition under a duopoly structure. By comparative static and dynamic analysis, we configure the equilibrium of price and quality competition when two MNOs are differentiated in terms of handset quality, marginal cost, and market share. Our results are as follows. When two operators are randomly differentiated in quality and market share, the regulation induces only the minor operator to lower its incumbent price with adjusting quality and cost (dis)advantages. Although the regulation can lead to a drop in ARPU as the regulator wishes, it is achieved at the cost of the minor operators loss of profit if the market structure is significantly asymmetric. If two operators can choose their quality of service in the long run and if marginal costs are dependent on the quality level, quality differentiation is more likely to happen with the regulation. As subsidies are banned, the major operator now targets customers who are less sensitive to quality by degrading its quality, thus charging a lower price. When the marginal cost is independent of quality level, both operators go for the top quality. Our findings propose that the market structure, financial status of operators, channel and cost of distributing handsets before the subsidy regulation is introduced be considered fully. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Nash equilibrium; Sequential game; Subsidy regulation"

Mobile social tourism, which refers to the use of mobile social media in tourism activities, is a newly proposed term that fits into the scope of smart tourism in this study. PLS-SEM has been employed to analyse the data collected through self-administered questionnaires. Most structural paths in the framework are consistent with past literatures, except for the negative influences of privacy concern. The mediation analysis suggests that these effects have been neutralized by perceived benefits and sense of belonging, which reaffirms the “privacy paradox” phenomenon in smart tourism research. Overall, the framework could provide adequate explanation towards continuance intention to create user-generated contents under the context of mobile social tourism. Both theoretical and practical implications are then discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Mobile social tourism; Perceived benefits; Privacy concern; Privacy paradox; Sense of belonging"

This study attempts to investigate what motivates customers to engage in these brand communities. Through a questionnaire survey of 430 Facebook users, this study investigates whether and how the unique characteristics (information quality, system quality, virtual interactivity, and rewards) of online brand communities affect customer engagement. The consequent effect of customer engagement on brand loyalty is also examined. This study frames and empirically validates a model for engaging customers with online brand communities on Facebook, considering the moderating role of gender. The Stimulus-Organism-Response paradigm is solicited to justify the theoretical background of this study. The data were analyzed using structure equation modelling. Results reveal that each of the characteristics positively influences customer engagement, with information quality and virtual interactivity bearing the strongest influence. Customer engagement also exhibits a strong positive impact on brand loyalty. This results further reveal that gender gap in the online environment is declining as the impact of all the four characteristics of online brand communities on customer engagement was invariable across male and female members. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Brand loyalty; Customer engagement; Information quality; Online brand community; Rewards; System quality; Virtual interactivity"

Objective As part of our ongoing work to research and establish better understanding of cyberstalking, this study aims to investigate the role of Police, Mobile Operators, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and owners/administrators of online platforms (e.g. websites, chatrooms) in terms of intervention in response to offences. We ask to what different authorities do people report incidents of cyberstalking? Do these authorities provide satisfactory responses or interventions? And how can this be improved? Furthermore, we discuss the role of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to encourage the implementation of cyberstalking-aware schemes by service providers to support victims. In addition, CSR can be used as a means to measure the effects of externality factor in dictating the relationship between the impact of a given individuals’ privacy loss and strategic decisions on investment to security controls in an organisational context. Method A mixed method design has been used in this study. Data collection took place by means of an online survey made available for three years to record both qualitative and quantitative data. Overall, 305 participants responded from which 274 identified themselves as victims of online harassment. Result Our results suggest that most offences were communicated through private channels such as emails and/or mobile texts/calls. A significant number of victims did not report this to their service provider because they did not know they could. While Police were recognised as the first-point-of-contact in such cases, 41.6% of our sample did not contact the Police due to reasons such as fear of escalation, guilt/sympathy and self-blaming. Experiences from those who have reported offences to service providers demonstrate that no or very little support was offered. Overall, the majority of participants shared the view that third-party intervention is required on their behalf in order to mitigate risks associated with cyberstalking. An independent specialist anti-stalking organisation was a popular choice to act on their behalf followed by the Police and network providers. Conclusion Incidents are taking place on channels owned and controlled by large, cross-border international companies providing mobile services, webmail and social networking. The lack of support offered to victims in many cases of cyberstalking can be identified as Corporate Social Irresponsibility (CSI). We anticipate that awareness should be raised as regarding service providers’ liability and social responsibility towards adopting better strategies. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate Social Responsibility; Cyberstalking; Incident response; Online harassment; Police; Service provider"

This study argues that social media are not only information channels; they can also be effective in communicating feelings and emotions. Social media use may contribute to political affects, which in turn impinge on civic and political participation. In addition, political affects may moderate the effects of social media use on political participation. Based on a survey of university students in Guangzhou, China (N = 897), this study finds that, under China's networked authoritarianism, political communication via social media is related to positive affects toward the government and society, while connection with activists via social media is related to negative affect. Positive and negative affects have different impact on different types of participation. Negative affects strengthen the connection between social media use and participation. The roles of three discrete negative emotions – anger, anxiety and fear – are also explored. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; Civic participation; Networked authoritarianism; Political affects; Political participation; Social media"

A factor analysis of the nine indicators of social viewing resulted in three factors – issue viewing, network viewing and critical viewing. The comparison of three factors across four programs showed that social viewing is sensitive to genres of programs. As expected, the documentary, a non-fiction genre, caused viewers to be engaged in issue related discussions with critical perspectives.

Participants were parents of 4770 children who were six to eleven years old. Using a survey questionnaire, they reported their children's average daily amount of screen and non-electronic activities times, and their screen-related parenting practices. Odds ratios were computed using logistic regression. Children whose parents reward good achievement/behavior by allowing screen time, punish bad achievement/behavior by prohibiting screen time, and allow screen time to keep them quiet are more likely to exceed the daily screen time recommendation of a maximum two hours. Screen-related home rules, physical activities and other alternate activities associated negatively with exceeding recommended screen time limit. Our study suggests that there is a need to develop effective strategies and intervention programs to educate parents to avoid screen-related parenting practices that increase their children's likelihood of exceeding the recommended media time. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The question as to whether Facebook is a more favorable choice of social media than a blog for political purposes must be addressed. In this comparative study, cross-sectional data collected in the 2009 and 2014 Taiwan local elections were used for exploring the differences among voter motivations, perceived credibility, and dependency between the use of political blogs and Facebook. In addition, the impact factors regarding the relationship between blogs and Facebook dependency were analyzed. The findings indicate that voter motivations, perceived credibility, and dependency were higher for political blogs than they were for Facebook, suggesting that in a political context, people prefer blogs to Facebook. The results of regression analyses indicate that the motivation for debating political topics was a significant predictor of the dependency on blogs, whereas motivations for general information and entertainment were related to Facebook use. The perceived credibility was not related to blog use; however, accuracy and information depth were significant factors for the use of Facebook. The reasons for the differences between peoples’ use of political blogs and Facebook are discussed in this paper.

Due to the recent growth in convergent products, technology users and consumers must choose among numerous different applications that can be perceived as either utilitarian or hedonic. This article suggests that new products launched on the market include attributes that are connected to sustainability and provide added value to consumers in their process of decision making. The primary question addressed in this article concerns whether an increase or decrease in consumer intention is based on the perception of the product's utility, and the consumer's prior experience and attitude toward green products. A 2 × 2 × 2 experiment was conducted to evaluate utilitarian or hedonic convergence, green attribute integration, and predisposition for (involvement with) green products. We propose that consumer value increases for those consumers with a high perception of green integration connected to a high predisposition for green devices, which increases the utilitarian value of the product or justifies the hedonic purchase of technological equipment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, we aimed to identify the primary motivations of emerging adults to use Tinder. The study was conducted among Dutch 18-30 year old emerging adults who completed an online survey. Over half of the sample were current or former Tinder users (n = 163). An exploratory factor analysis, using a parallel analysis approach, uncovered six motivations to use Tinder: Love, Casual Sex, Ease of Communication, Self-Worth Validation, Thrill of Excitement, and Trendiness. In contrast to previously suggested, the Love motivation appeared to be a stronger motivation to use Tinder than the Casual Sex motivation. In line with literature on online dating, men were more likely to report a Casual Sex motivation for using Tinder than women. In addition, men more frequently reported Ease of Communication and Thrill of Excitement motives. With regard to age, the motivation Love, Casual Sex and Ease of Communication were positively related to age. Finally, Tinder motivations were meaningfully related to offline encounters with Tinder matches. In sum, the study showed that emerging adults have six primary motivations to use Tinder and that these motivations differ according to one's age and gender. Tinder should not be seen as merely a fun, hookup app without any strings attached, but as a new way for emerging adults to initiate committed romantic relationships. Notably, the findings call for a more encompassing perspective on why emerging adults use Tinder. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The licensing department of a local authority in Penang, Malaysia is the major department involved in the processing and issuance of various types of licenses. The traditional method of processing of licenses manually has been a subject of criticism by license applicants and the public due to the delay in processing and the inefficient feedback mechanism. Over a period of two years, the licensing department has been working closely with the system designers by providing input on the construction of the E-Licensing system. All the time spent and the investment would go to waste if the employees do not intend to use the system. This study is focused on factors affecting intention to use of technology enabled service delivery (E-Licensing) by employees. The research model by Moore and Benbasat (1991) was adapted and used in this study. Six hypotheses were formulated to test the relationship proposed. The data collected from a sample of 92 respondents was used in the analysis of the hypothesis. The findings from this study show that (i) perceived usefulness/relative advantage is positively related to intention to use E-Licensing. (ii) Perceived ease of use and result demonstrability is positively related to intention to use E-Licensing. (iii) Visibility/observability is positively related to intention to use E-Licensing.

These psychological factors are modelled through the lens of Upper Echelon Theory (UET) to study their interrelationship and interdependency and further prioritize them to strategize appropriate managerial actions. The factors were identified through an exhaustive literature review and further confirmed by the experts in the field. A hybrid Interpretive Structural Modelling – Analytic Network Process (ISM-ANP) approach has been adopted to establish the complex interrelationship among the psychological drivers and further to cluster and prioritize them. The main contribution of this study is composing directions and dominance of various psychological drivers to enhance decision-making process of managers towards the adoption of Green IT/IS. As long as decisions are made by individuals within organizations, this paper forms the basis of identifying individual-level factors important in motivating managers towards Green IT/IS adoption. The results of this study would help organizations and policy makers to understand and develop strategies to target and select an individual for managerial position with mind-set more towards environmental sustainability and Green IT/IS concepts.

Thus, in order to provide better academic achievement, more and more instructors are adapting collaborative learning to their classes. However, two major problems lurk behind collaborative learning. First, it is difficult to apply collaborative learning because students tend to engage passively with traditional lectures. As a result, interactive technologies such as clickers have been applied to increase interactive learning and raise the rate of interaction. Nevertheless, these interactive technologies still have some limitations, such as limited mobility, high costs, setup issues, technical difficulties, and little support of higher-order thinking skills. Second, recently there has been an increasing number of EMI (English as Medium of Instruction) courses added to university course offerings in countries where English is not the first language. The goal of these courses is to support university internationalization and address the global status of English. However, it is even harder to achieve in-class interaction in large EMI lecture courses. In addition, some studies argue that EMI courses might affect the overall learning of course content because of students’ poor lecture comprehension and passive engagement in class. In order to address the limitations of interactive technologies, encourage more collaborative learning, facilitate greater in-class interaction in large lecture courses, and resolve students’ poor lecture comprehension in EMI courses, the author introduces MEMIS (Mobile-Supported English-Medium Instruction System), which includes both a T&S (Teachers & Students) mobile app and an EMI pedagogical method. The author first provides detailed implementation and all the features of the T&S mobile app, which improves students’ perceptions of classroom participation and in-class interaction. Then the author explains how she develops her EMI pedagogy such that it utilizes the features of the T&S mobile app to: 1) increase students’ overall learning in her EMI course, 2) develop students’ construction of knowledge and higher-order thinking, and 3) achieve all six cognitive processes from Bloom's revised taxonomy. The author adapts a quasi-experimental design, statistically analyzes the effectiveness of both exam scores and final grades between a control group and an experimental group, and then asks students to evaluate their experiences and provide feedback about MEMIS. Based on both statistical results and students’ overall feedback, the author confirms that MEMIS is an effective approach that improves lecture comprehension, encourages more class engagement, promotes collaborative learning, and achieves better learning outcomes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bloom's revised taxonomy; Collaborative learning; Effective teaching; English as Medium of Instruction; Mobile app; Pedagogy"

It argues in favor of how mobile phones could empower socio-economically marginalized young people to overcome their marginality by examining its use within the broader socio-cultural, economic and political contexts. Drawing on the information and communication capabilities of mobile phones, this paper uses an ethnographic data and a synthesized empowerment framework to analyze the relationship between mobile phone usage and empowerment of marginalized young people in Sierra Leone. In doing so, the paper focuses on the socio-culture, political and economic uses of mobile phones. The focus on these uses is based on the argument that for mobile phones to empower marginalized young people their uses should facilitate economic, political and socio-cultural issues underpinning their marginality. The study results suggest that mobile phones empower marginalized young people to communicate and access vital livelihood information to articulate their everyday activities.

This article suggests that some actors are aware that social networks can be used in a positive direction to lobby their target. It also shows that some others are not aware of the dimension of those networks. In order to test the effect of social networks, this article draws on an unprecedented dataset of interest groups in the European Union. Using quantitative and qualitative analysis of more than 44,000 tweets through dedicated software, this article studies the success and the failure of several interest groups. The findings indicate that Intermarché, a French supermarket chain, failed to communicate with the general public, leaving scope to the NGO Bloom helped by a successful comic posted on the web. By doing so, Intermarché has won on the field of lobbying to decision makers in Brussels, but lost on the public opinion field.

Many traditional media companies are utilizing social media platforms such as WeChat, Weibo (Micro Blog), and Cellphone-Applications to expand their influence. But how has social media contributed to the transformation process of traditional mainstream media in China? Did they push the reform in both deep level and superficial level? We attempts to find the answers by taking CCTV (China's state media) as the subject of research and explore the social factors that facilitated China's traditional media's transformation process, the traditional media's achievements, as well as the challenges during this period. The paper consists of six parts. In the first part, we had a literature review, and elaborated on terms included in this paper. In the second part, we gave an general introduction to different development periods of CCTV station, CCTV News programs and CCTV's social media transformation. In the third part, we analyzed the factors that encouraged CCTV to take the strategy of transformation, which are also urging other mainstream media companies in China to take the same steps. In the fourth part, we looked into the achievements the media companies made during the transformation period. Afterwards, the deficiencies and limitations in the transformation process are also analyzed. Finally, we drew conclusions that in the process of transformation, social media plays an important role in superficial reform while attaining very limited achievements in the fundamental level. There is still a long way to go in order to accomplish the all-round integration with new media. The thesis utilizes in-depth interviews, content analysis and literature review as methods of research. It is worth mentioning that this paper is based on first-hand data retrieved from the New Media Department of CCTV News Center. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","@CCTV NEWS; Media convergent; Media integration; Microblog, WeChat and APP; Social media transformation"

These evolutions pose some challenges for the media companies in terms of shifting business models, but they also bring them new possibilities in managing their relations with users. An important first step here is to identify the online users and turn anonymous users into registered ones. Today, however, there is a myriad of logins and passwords one needs when surfing the web, which can make the management of these logins a challenge for users. The Belgian media industry seeks to deal with this challenge by introducing a collaborative nation-wide single sign-on (SSO) system across their digital platforms, called Media ID. This paper provides four scenarios describing the potential outcomes in terms of user adoption and hence market potential of the integration of a SSO service into a regional media system. The scenarios are built upon focus group interviews with media users and in-depth interviews with the stakeholders from the involved media companies. They describe to what extent the innovative service can influence user's online media consumption behaviour but also to what extent the media companies can implement it, two factors that mutually shape each other. In the discussion of the scenarios, requirements to ensure the broad applicability of a SSO service by both media users and media organizations are identified. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd .

Traditional methods of teaching 3D modeling mostly depend on the use of three-view diagrams to guide students in the construction of a spatial cognition. However, a lack of three-dimensional and spatial ability on the part of the learners limits the effectiveness of this type of teaching material, and instructional effectiveness is also restricted by the existing spatial ability among students. In traditional approaches to technical education, students assume a largely passive role, while instruction adopts methods that emphasize rote learning, but these approaches are in the process of being transformed. Accordingly, the present study attempts to combine the Conceive, Design, Implement, Operate (CDIO) educational framework and 3D printing-tangible teaching materials for college students to explore potential improvements in learning outcomes. Experimental results indicate that different teaching materials (three-view diagrams and 3D printed solid models) result in the development of different spatial abilities (specifically, mental rotation and spatial visualization) and learning outcomes. In addition, the use of solid models results in 3D model learning outcomes better than those achieved using traditional three-view diagrams. Inspired by theories of perception and motivation and dual coding theory, this study developed a set of differentiated spatial ability teaching models to improve learning effectiveness for 3D modeling. The results provide guidance for the development of teaching materials and models appropriate to learners’ spatial abilities. © 2016","3D printing; CDIO; Differentiated spatial ability teaching model; Improving classroom teaching; Pedagogical issues"

Drawbacks of large classes over smaller ones include the reduction of quality student-lecturer interactions, and prevalence of teacher-centered approach to learning. Given these constraints, using mobile messaging apps can ease student-lecturer interactions beyond those attainable in face to face classes. As such, the main proposition of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of using an Interactive Mobile Messaging App (IMMAP) in classrooms of higher education for supporting student-lecturer interactions. The key predictors identified from the Interactive Mobile Messaging Acceptance model were used as a guide to design and develop IMMAP. The predictors are perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, self-efficacy, enjoyment, system quality, information quality, and uncertainty avoidance The pretest-posttest design where participants are studied before and after the experiment concluded was used in this study. Students' perceptions of IMMAP in relation to their adoption intention were obtained using both pretest and posttest surveys. A total of 38 students from two different courses evaluated IMMAP. Findings revealed significant changes on a number of indicators. Uncertainty avoidance level decreased significantly (higher positive score) from pretest to posttest, while system quality increased. In terms of enjoyment, a significant decrease was observed from pretest to posttest. Adoption intention of IMMAP saw a significant increase. The findings reflect students' readiness to use IMMAP in the classrooms to interact with their lecturers. Therefore, investing in the development of mobile messaging apps has the potential to improve the quality of student-lecturer interactions in the classrooms. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Blended learning; Computer-mediated communication; Higher education; Improving classroom teaching; Interactive learning environments"

This study employs the framework of density dependence to understand what drives the adoption of social media by organizations. Fixed-effects negative binominal regression models were run to test the hypotheses that predicted the founding rates of 2007 Chinese newspaper organizations in 31 provincial units on Sina Weibo from August 2009 to June 2015. The results show that the founding rate of party newspapers exhibits inverted U-shaped relationships to local or non-local party newspaper density and non-party newspaper density. At the same time, the density dependence hypothesis is supported only for the effect of non-party newspaper density outside the provincial unit on the founding rate of non-party newspapers. Unexpectedly, non-party newspaper density within the provincial boundary exerts no significant influence on this founding rate. Both local and non-local party newspaper densities significantly and negatively influence the decisions to start homepages on Sina Weibo among non-newspaper organizations.

The chances that incumbent instant messaging (IM) users will suffer from involuntary switching have increased because competition can eliminate their service/technology providers. This concern leads to our research question: what factors influence IM users' decision-making in involuntary switching? In light of the above concerns, this study aims to extend the push-pull-mooring (PPM) framework and the migration theory to the context of service involuntary switching by incorporating the notions of network effects and regret. Our model theorizes that four constructs of network effects (referent network size, future expectation, perceived complementary, and perceived compatibility), similarity and innovativeness (pull factors), switching cost (mooring factors), and three push factors regarding migration plan and outcome (dissatisfaction with technical quality and information quality of the migration plan and regret) can affect users' intention to migrate to other IM services and subsequently alter their migration behaviors.

To test this hypothesis, we used a large survey data set of Internet users (n = 3,120) and examined how users' socio-demographic positions interact with Internet access to shape the affordance of network diversity and multiplicity. We found significant interactive effects, while network diversity, as indicated by homogeneity and heterogeneity, was not directly impacted by social positions. The effects of network multiplicity on personal wellbeing also differed by socio-demographic background. We argue that, without an understanding of socio-demographic disparities, a focus on Internet affordance fails to recognize the social reproduction in the creation and the benefits of personal networks. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The time period, 2004-2013, selected for the study is interesting because many technical innovations took place molding the mobile phone market dramatically. The study utilizes comprehensive phone model and sales data collected in Finland, combined with temporally ordered probabilistic models to discover the time behavior of predictivity. More precisely, the Tree Augmented Naïve Bayes - classification method is adapted to detect those phone characteristics that best predict the annual phone popularity measured as phone model unit sales. Linear regression and the Chow test are used to discover potential trends and structural breaks. The strength of the predictivity is measured as Kullback-Leibler Divergence. This kind of systematic longitudinal analysis highlights patterns, which are otherwise not possible to observe. The study discovered that the operating system is clearly the only feature with an increasing strength in predicting popularity over time. In contrast, sixteen features have structural breaks between 2004 and 2013. Most such breaks are related to the technical evolution of phones: their display, communication, and camera capabilities. Notably, the structural break in 2007-2008 related to the phone manufacturer brand is interpreted as the market turning from hardware to software driven mode, which contributed to Nokia's failure with Symbian and Windows operating systems, and to Google's success with a hardware independent operating system Android. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The continuously interaction of their mobile devices with the mobile network infrastructure creates digital traces that can be easily logged by the network operators. These digital traces can be further used, apart from billing and resource management, for large-scale population monitoring using mobile traffic analysis. They could be integrated into intelligent systems that could help at detecting exceptional events such as riots, protests or even at disaster preventions with minimal costs and improve people safety and security, or even save lives. In this paper we study the use of fully anonymized and highly aggregate cellular network data, like Call Detail Records (CDRs) to analyze the telecommunication traffic and connect people, locations and events. The results show that by analyzing the CDR data exceptional spatio-temporal patterns of mobile data can be correlated to real-world events. For example, high user network activity was mapped to religious festivals, such as Ramadan, Le Grand Magal de Touba and the Tivaouane Maouloud festival. During the Ramadan period it was noticed that the communication pattern doubled during the night with a slow start during the morning and along the day. Furthermore, a peak increase in the number of voice calls and voice calls duration in the area of Kafoutine was mapped to the Casamance Conflict in the area which resulted in four deaths. Thus, these observations could be further used to develop an intelligent system that detects exceptional events in real-time from CDRs data monitoring. Such system could be used in intelligent transportation management, urban planning, emergency situations, network resource allocation and performance optimization, etc. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Call Detail Records; Cellular networks; Human mobility; Mobile traffic analysis"

However its role in politics, particularly in electoral campaigns, in economically developing democracies with low internet accessibility, is largely unknown. This study conducts an investigation of Twitter's use as a campaign tool during the 2014 Indian general elections, which was the country's first experiment with using social media for political campaigning. We present a multi-level manual and computer-aided analysis of 98,363 tweets posted by eleven political parties during the two-month run up to the elections, to present the topical, functional and interaction strategies of their Twitter campaigns. This analysis is complemented by a macro analysis of electoral outcomes' relationship with first-time voter population and internet accessibility information at the state level. Our findings suggest that the new-and-upcoming parties used Twitter for self-promotion and media validation, while established parties used it to supplement their offline strategies. It is also observed that the winning party's electoral success is significantly associated with their use of Twitter for engaging voters, the large population of first-time voters and levels of internet accessibility.

The first sample utilized 241 responses to understand the relative awareness of 20 concepts that are known to belong to e-government topic. The second sample included a two stage method, with an extended survey. A survey including the 20 concepts and an additional 14 items measured four constructs: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, privacy and security assurance, and trust in e-government. The second survey was distributed to a class of 50 students at the start of an e-government course and at the end of it. Results of the first survey indicated high levels of awareness in regard to service provision, time and location, and necessity of information needed. Dimensions like digital divide (gender and accessibility) and social change were among the highly recognized topics. On the other hand, e-participation and political concepts of e-government were moderately perceived by the sample.

Higher rates of broadband penetration and adoption are associated with enhanced economic growth, while for individuals accessing the Internet through a broadband connection opens up a range of opportunities to them. However, to enjoy these opportunities users need access to both an Internet connection as well as the possession of a range of skills. As not everyone has access to one or both of these, a range of digital divides have emerged within and between countries. This paper explores one aspect of the digital divides that have emerged, namely, speed. Broadband speeds vary considerably, reflecting many factors such as the technology(s) used, the number of users, the distance of the user from the telephone exchange and so forth. Rather than explore the digital divides that exist between countries, we focus on a single city: Glasgow. Using data from a variety of sources we explore broadband speeds across the city. While broadband speeds have improved across much of Glasgow, this is not true every part of the city. Average speeds vary considerably across the city, with the consequence that the ability to access opportunities online also varies. There is some evidence to suggest that those parts of the city with lower levels of deprivation enjoy higher broadband speeds than areas within Glasgow of higher deprivation levels. Our analysis also found that considerable variations exist between service providers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Broadband speed; Digital divide; Glasgow"

One of the most popular social networking sites, Facebook, has received a considerable attention in recent years, and the excessive use of Facebook has become a major concern in schools. The purpose of this study was to investigate the reasons for Facebook addiction. By surveying 894 college students in Taiwan, we found that although only 1% was classified as addicts, 17.8% were in the alert group. Approximately 80% of the students used Facebook every day, and 10% spent more than 8 h a day on Facebook. Interpersonal relationships and online social support were found to be positively associated with Facebook addiction; however, some personality traits, such as agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism, were negatively associated with Facebook addiction. Online interpersonal relationships and neuroticism were found to be prominent predictors of Facebook addiction. Practical implications are provided herein. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the popularity of using smartphones at destinations, the tourist experience is no longer bounded by the physical limits of the destination. This study considers the relationship between travel motivation, smartphone-related constructs of motivation to share travel experience while visiting the destination (sharing motivation), smartphone usage at the destination, and tourist experience and trip satisfaction arising from the entanglement of the physical space and the virtual space connected through the smartphone. The relationships are examined in the context of Hualien, a popular nature-based destination in Taiwan. Partial least squares analysis of the data obtained from 297 Taiwan residents who had visited Hualien at least once and who possessed smartphones showed that tourist experience and satisfaction are determined by the physical space of the destination and the virtual space connected by the smartphone. However, the inroads made by smartphones are still limited for nature-based destinations, and smartphones may not always have a positive influence. This study also found that tourists, who have different travel motivations and on-site sharing motivations, react to this joint physical-virtual space differently. The use of smartphones at the destination may simply be a reaction to boredom and to kill time, hence the lack of influence of on-site experience sharing on experience and satisfaction. This study showed that tourists value the functional purpose provided by smartphones. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Destination; On-site experience sharing; Satisfaction; Smartphone; Tourist experience; Tourist motivation"

Data were collected from a probability sample of 509 information workers in Hong Kong who were not self-employed. The results showed that the more that people used ICT to do their work at home, the greater they perceived their work/family borders flexible and permeable. Interestingly, low flexibility and high permeability, rather than the use of ICT at home, had much stronger influences on increasing, in particular, family-to-work conflict. As expected, work-to-family conflict was significantly and positively associated with technostress. Results also showed that the telecommuters tended to be older, had lower family incomes, used ICT frequently at home, and had a permeable boundary that allowed work to penetrate their home domain.

The objectives of this study are to examine consumers’ purchase intention toward a target SSS in different countries and to understand these differences from a cross-cultural perspective. In order to explore the cross-cultural differences in consumers’ purchase intention toward a target SSS, we propose an analytic framework that consists of website quality (i.e. system, information, and service quality) and relationship quality (i.e. satisfaction, commitment, and trust) that the SSS provides. To identify the determinants of purchase intention of SSS, large-scale online surveys were conducted in Taiwan and Japan simultaneously with the same questionnaire. Results show that perceptions of the two types of quality for a target SSS are significantly different between Taiwan and Japan, and effects of the quality types on the degree of purchase intention derived from the SSS also vary across the two countries.

By migrating to cloud services, Saudi universities will be moving data and programs from local servers to the internet, thereby providing users with the ability to access and share information at any time from multiple devices. The migration to cloud-based IT resources is not yet widespread in Saudi universities due to several challenges including security, legal policies and implementation. At present, there is lack of research and guidance for Saudi universities on how to overcome these challenges and how contextual factors can influence the successful migration to the educational clouds. This research presents a framework for the successful migration to cloud technology in the Saudi Arabian universities. In this research, a set of key critical success factors (CSFs) were identified by synthesizing components from studies concerned with the migration of cloud for higher education and factors identified from the successful implementation of WBL (Web Based Learning) and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) on higher education in Saudi Arabia. Based on this knowledge, the proposed framework was evaluated via expert review and a survey by IT specialists from the Saudi universities. The initial CSFs were updated based on the expert reviews and the results were analysed. Based on the findings at this stage, additional CSFs were added to the framework as suggested by the experts. Subsequently, in order to confirm the reviewed CSFs, additional investigation via a structured online questionnaire was conducted and the outcome was analysed via one-sample t-test with the data integrity analysed via Cronbach's alpha.

The Chinese are, typically, quite concerned with social affairs that relate most closely to their personal interests and preferences. People tend to cluster around political events more often than social events and non-public events. This is demonstrated by an algorithm embedded with a clustering growth pattern of events, which predicts the popularity of online political events above others.

The traditional distribution of power in ICT industries of mobile communication sectors has significantly changed based on relations with the new actors. Recently, the concept of a “mobile ecosystem” which embraces this environmental shift is highlighted. The traditional industries such as hardware and network-based firms and new ICT industries such as software and service-based firms grow up simultaneously creating the mobile ecosystem. In this respect, this study aims to explore ecological indexes for identifying roles of ICT industries in the mobile ecosystem. To be specific, the ecological indexes are proposed to take new roles and position of ICT industries in the perspective of ecosystem into account. For this, the inter-industry analysis, which includes the physical flows between industries, is mainly used since the ecosystem is operated by streamlining physical flows. First, the mobile ecosystem is structured by using physical input-output flows and industrial relationships. Second, to explore roles of ICT industries in the mobile ecosystem, four ecological indexes have been developed and combined based on the result of inter-industry analysis: productivity, size, spillover effect, and coverage. As a result, we identified six roles for ICT industries and their relationships: commodity, landlord, controller, keystone, facilitator, and dominator.

In this research, we examine the effects of two explanatory variables (i.e., personalization and ease of use), arguably the two most critical factors, on the success of location-based system (LBS) in terms of economic gains, perceived benefits, and intention to continue service usage. Personalization enabled by contextualization (personalization for short) of LBS enhances the quality of information provided, and ease of use is a representative system quality variable. To examine the association, our research focuses on consumers' decision-making regarding where to buy gasoline and the effects of LBS-assisted searching for gas price information on user perceptions and actual behavior. We utilize two research methods for this empirical study: a field experiment and two complementary field surveys.

Social-network-based communication is becoming a necessity for companies to stay competitive. However, using social networks to effectively promote electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) remains challenging. Managers in general are unfamiliar with the key factors that can encourage online social network members to engage in eWOM. This study used social capital and self-determination theories to identify three social capital factors and two individual factors on eWOM. A survey of 238 social network users was conducted to determine the relative influence of these five factors on eWOM among the users. The partial least square analysis results indicate that tie strength and innovativeness directly influence eWOM in virtual social networks. Trust, shared language, and voluntary self-disclosure do not exhibit a significant influence. Theoretical and practical implications of the five factors for promoting eWOM in social networks are drawn from these findings. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, project proponents should not only try to attract more visitors but also understand their funding intention, which is particularly important in increasing the success of fundraising projects. Based on social exchange theory, this study examines the key factors influencing backers' funding intention. More than 204 experienced backers in Taiwan participated in this study, and structural equation modeling was applied for data analysis. Results show that commitment has a remarkable and positive effect on funding intention. Interestingly, perceived risk was found to be positively associated with funding intention, which challenges the conventional view of perceived risk having a negative effect on usage intention. The moderating effects of regulatory focus and funding amount are also discussed.

To the general public, however, using these devices for disaster applications is still a novel concept. In disasters, most people are reluctant to rely on unfamiliar technologies. Thus, for these devices to become truly useful in disasters, it is important to understand factors that affect their acceptance by the public. Previous studies show that perceived usefulness is a clear antecedent of people's acceptance of smart wearable devices. However, the underlying factors that affect perceived usefulness itself are not clearly known. Thus, the aim of this study is to fill this gap, and by doing so, to derive some practical implications for solution developers and governments. This study used structural equation modelling to analyse survey data collected from 647 respondents in Japan. We found that the respondents’ perceived usefulness of the current applications of smart wearable devices was a strong predictor of their perceived usefulness of using these devices for disaster applications. Although indirect factors such as the ownership of ICT gadgets and the usage of social media also had some influences, most of their effects were mediated through increasing the respondents’ perceived usefulness of the current applications. In other words, through appreciating the functions of the current applications of smart wearable devices, people can visualise the usefulness of these devices in disaster situations. That being said, we found that in parallel, people also had concerns on the privacy issues of these devices. These findings shed light on the promotion and development of this fast growing technology for disaster applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Disaster preparedness; ICT for disaster management; Perceived usefulness; Smart wearable devices; Technology acceptance model"

Analysis shows that regulatory philosophy and the framework of telecommunications and broadcasting were constructed in different historical contexts in both countries. The perception that communication technologies are public resources was pervasive in the U.S., but in Korea, the function of broadcasting was recognized as a means of government control or dissemination of propaganda implemented under Japanese colonial authorities and the rule of the U.S. military government.

We suggest that this individualistic use of social media is related to selfie related conflicts between partners through two processes: (1) jealousy, stemming from excessive individual photo-sharing or comments about those pictures, and (2) that, by sharing flattering images of oneself, an online ideal persona is created in the picture-taker's mind that diverges from real-life. These conflicts in turn reduce perceived quality of the romantic relationships. To test the model we conducted a two-wave, representative panel survey, separated by one year. Results support a partial mediation model between taking selfies and lower perception of relationship quality, suggesting that both mediators, jealousy and the online ideal persona, have a negative effect on romantic relationship over time. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Broadcasters in a number of nations and regions operate under content regulatory schemes designed to serve cultural and economic purposes, put into place during the age of terrestrial broadcasting in which national policymakers could tightly control the availability of content in the country. This article explores these issues through an analysis of the rationales, policy approaches, and effectiveness of domestic content policies in four countries (Australia, Canada, Ireland, and South Korea) and considers the implications of these approaches in a globally connected environment. The researchers identified common issues across the four countries: (1) development of national content industries does not necessarily imply the promotion or protection of national culture, (2) production companies and broadcasters have interests and incentives that diverge from those of policymakers, and (3) it is difficult to assess the relevance and quality of broadcast content with regards to domestic culture other than in terms of conventional standards: critical acclaim and audience share. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Driven by the need to control operating costs and optimize content delivery to end-users, network operators in Latin America (and elsewhere in developing regions) are increasingly experimenting with cooperative peering arrangements to meet interconnection needs. The evidence suggests that these new arrangements are resulting in multiple benefits to local Internet ecosystems, among them reduced transit costs, greater network redundancy, improved service quality, new infrastructure investments and better technical coordination among operators. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A satisfactory CBLS can help promote business activities in cross-border e-commerce. Because customers’ logistical needs are increasingly complex and the logistics market is increasingly competitive, a CBLS provider has to be devoted to continually improving and differentiating services to maintain its competitive advantage. Kansei engineering (KE) is an approach to design the elements which satisfy customers’ affective and emotional perceptions into services and products. In this study, the KE approach is applied to derive ideas for the development of CBLS. For this purpose, Partial Least Squares (PLS) is used to analyze the relationships between the feelings of customers and service elements of CBLS. Moreover, this study demonstrates the applications of text mining techniques to analyze the online contents regarding CBLS. Online content mining assists in identifying the service elements and Kansei words for CBLS. Importantly, the relationship between the feelings of customers and service elements of CBLS obtained by online content mining provides complementary results for CBLS design. Relevance to industry: this study offers an exemplification on applying the integration of Kansei engineering and online content analysis to obtain ideas for the process Kansei design in service industry.

To benefit from technological progress it is necessary to adapt the computer applications to these technologies, however this operation is costly to health facilities especially in developing countries. In terms of scientific research, this observation explains the development of model-driven engineering of computer systems such as the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) approach. MDA is a computer design approach for the development of computer systems that considers separately the functional needs of technical needs of an application. MDA mainly uses the models and their transformations whose traces allow MDA to capitalize expertise in terms of technology and to ensure some rapid modernization of applications to new technologies which results in a significant productivity gain. Today there is a huge requirement worldwide in the interoperable services, in particular with regard to their valuable contribution to the collaboration ability of remote information technology systems. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an interesting architectural pattern in which software components contribute to the collaboration and sharing of services. In this way, the principles of SOA are intended to ensure interoperability between heterogeneous and distributed applications. Web services are at the heart of SOA, which splits functions into different services, accessible over a computer network that enables users to associate and reuse them in the exploitation of applications. Health applications have a strong need to communicate with the remote institutions in order to provide the most relevant services to patients and to collaborate with other medical partners to solve complex tasks.

These possibilities have made mobile advertising a strategic business plan in today's global competitive marketing world. This trend of mobile advertising in South Africa and the extent to which it infringes on the information privacy of consumers is examined in this paper. Using 440 questionnaires administered to Generation Y students at two universities: North West University, and Vaal University of Technology, the perceptions of these Generation Y students towards information privacy with regard to mobile advertising was explored. Data analysis which included regression analysis, Pearson's correlation analysis, reliability test and preliminary data analysis revealed that Generation Y students seemed not to be bothered about the usefulness of mobile advertising messages but were however concerned about the information privacy associated with such marketing activities. It was also revealed that the ability of Generation Y students to control the usage of their data and the frequency of exposure to mobile advertising will positively influence their perception towards mobile advertising. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Generation Y; Information privacy; Mobile advertisement; South Africa"

Consequently, medical tourism has emerged as a new and booming market. Hospitals in Taiwan have excellent medical quality and highly-ranked information technology. The geographical, cultural, and linguistic proximity between Taiwan and Mainland China further enhances the appeal of medical tourism in Taiwan as an option for patients from China. Thus, the Taiwanese government has actively modified and improved various aspects of its tourism infrastructure, such as visa regulations, marketing policies, and technologies, to attract medical tourists. One important technology marketing method in its arsenal is the Taiwan Medical Travel App (TMT App), which can be downloaded to mobile devices. The TMT App focuses on promoting Taiwan's medical tourism. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the TMT App and the usage intention of Chinese patients have not been evaluated. This study proposes a research model based on a literature review to explore the factors that influence Chinese patients' intention to use the TMT App. The research model is then validated using questionnaires and statistical analyses.

Despite the wide diffusion of SNSs and their increasing political influence, traditional media such as TV have retained their influence to a certain extent because new media and traditional media are not independent of each other. In particular, recent technological advances have made it possible for individuals to exchange their opinions through SNSs on a real-time basis while watching TV. As a result, the formation of political discourse may shift from the traditional mass media to social media, and viewer responses generated through social media may be transferred quickly to the mass media. Given this important trend, this study provides an empirical analysis of the pattern of interactions between TV and SNSs in the Korean context. More specifically, the study investigates the features and patterns of online messages from SNS users in Korea about TV debates during the Seoul mayoral by-election in 2011. By assuming some differences in features of political discourse across various types of SNSs, the study compares those features specifically associated with TV debates by considering Twitter, Facebook, and blogs. The results suggest that SNS users not only accept and interpret political discourse while watching TV but also participate actively in its production and restructuring. In addition, the results indicate some differences in communication patterns between the three SNS platforms. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

While not denying the relevance of these critiques, this article looks at the multiple, unstable, and at times contradictory effects of the micropolitics of ICT4D assemblages and their articulation to the more general project of the ""information society"" in Turkey. Mobilizing a Foucauldian framework of governmentality, this article considers norms, rationalities, and models of governance as technologies of power that are productive of certain socio-technical orders, while distributing agency within them. In the Turkish context, ICT4D is implicated in the trend toward multistakeholderism, or network governance, steered by non-governmental organizations, tech companies, and the United Nations. I argue that ICT4D governance networks operate on the basis of two governing logics: participatory self-governance with regard to ""local"" and ""communal"" affairs and biopolitical management with regard to ""global"" affairs, including the modes of operation of informational capitalism.

This study explored the factors affecting students' intentions to use social media for learning based on their learning styles (i.e., participatory, collaborative, and independent), using the social media acceptance model. By convenience sampling, 300 Malaysian students were recruited via an online survey (Nparticipatory = 116; Nindependent = 97; and Ncollaborative = 87). The survey was prepared by drawing on the social media acceptance model. It was piloted before the final data collection step was conducted in August 2013.

The results revealed the significant effect of Self and Performance on students' intentions to use social media regardless of their learning styles. A pair-wise comparison revealed that Self was more significant in participatory students than in collaborative students. Effort was found to be the least significant factor, indicating the popularity of social media among students.

As evidence of this trend, the diffusion of new interactive, converged video services like Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) shows a rapid growth in many countries. In spite of a growing body of scholarship on IPTV diffusion, there is currently no empirical work that examines IPTV diffusion at the macro-level. This study fills this void in the literature by examining the macro-level factors influencing IPTV diffusion through regression analysis. Data analysis suggests inter-modal competition between different broadband technologies is more effective than intra-modal competition (local loop unbundling policy) in promoting IPTV diffusion. Results also indicate that pay TV market size contributes to IPTV diffusion. It appears that, in many countries, IPTV is more likely to be deployed as the market size of pay TV services increases. In addition, data analysis demonstrates urban population is a statistically significant indicator for explaining IPTV diffusion. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The development of internet features in mobile phones has also continuously and extensively changed from providing only limited internet browsing in the early 2000s to high quality video on demand today. The speed of the internet has also increased significantly since the introduction of smartphones. After the implementation of 3G networks in the past decade and the recent LTE networks of 4G technology in the last few years, the transmission speed of mobile internet supports the use of mobile phones to provide high-speed internet services known as mobile broadband. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that mobile broadband has a positive effect on economic outputs as well as reducing the problem of the digital divide, especially in rural areas where fixed broadband infrastructure is limited or not available. This paper analyses how mobile internet adoption has developed in the last decade and what factors determine mobile broadband adoption at this stage when smartphones are highly developed and the transmission speed is much improved. In this paper, Sweden is selected as a case study. The data set used in this paper is mainly based on the annual questionnaire conducted by the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority (PTS) in 2013. The methodology of this paper applies bivariate probit with sample selection since the data set consists of two sets of binary outcomes (adoption and usage). The findings show that smartphone adoption is less likely in the group of respondents who are older, have a lower income, lower level of education and live outside Stockholm. The findings on smartphone usage show that lower income respondents tend to use social networking, online shopping and internet telephone more than those with a higher income. The reasons could be explained by these kinds of applications reducing the costs for users compared with offline services. Identifying the determinants of mobile broadband adoption and usage is very useful for broadband policy, especially a policy related to reducing the digital divide. Policymakers can therefore use these findings to encourage the population to use the applications and services, especially people who are still non-adopters. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Mobile adoption; Mobile broadband; Sweden"

The first part of the article argues that despite important changes in broadcast delivery technology, more recently shaped by the growth of the Internet, and the associated growth of options of receiving television content, the traditional delivery platforms (digital terrestrial, satellite and cable) remain by far the preferred choice for viewers in Britain. At the same time, public service broadcasters continue to be the biggest investors in domestic original non-sport content and account for over half of all television viewing. The strength of PSBs in content and their growing reliance on commercial proprietary subscription platforms (cable and satellite) and gradually on the Internet presents challenges in the nexus between broadcasters and distributors. The article focuses on the debate over retransmission fees between PSBs and Sky, and on the question of whether Sky should be required to offer some of its premium content to rival pay-TV platforms. These two examples highlight the impact regulatory intervention can have on the balance of power between broadcasters and distributors. The article concludes that such debates concerning the commercial relations between content providers and distributors will remain pivotal and become more heated given that similar issues are raised in the Internet environment. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A web-based survey of Taiwan Internet forums was used to collect data and yielded 265 valid responses. Structure equation modeling was conducted to assess the proposed relationships. Results revealed that all four dimensions influenced satisfaction and trust, with distributive justice producing the strongest relative effect in the online game context. As expected, positive perceptions of online service recovery efforts not only left customers satisfied and trusting, but also generated positive e-WOM about their service experiences as well as encouraged them to continue the service. An important contribution of this study for service recovery concerns the differential effects of perceived justice on post-recovery trust that is vital in forming loyalty behaviors in the online game context.

More specifically, the concept of Quality of Service is often overlooked in traditional relationships based on best effort. This study offers a qualitative analysis and assessment of the multidimensional impacts of the recent proposals of introducing Assured Service Quality (ASQ) in the Internet interconnection (IC) market. The analysis focuses on the impacts in four distinct, though strongly interrelated areas: Business, Socioeconomic, Regulatory and Net Neutrality. Methodologically, the impacts and their interplays are identified through a focus group, which involved key informants from 17 European Carriers and stakeholders. Exploring how these complementary impacts may affect the ASQ offer is fundamental for envisioning the Internet infrastructure's business and technological evolution, as well as for setting appropriate governance policies. This study identifies and discusses the expected impacts, thus shedding light on the key implications of ASQ IC. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

With China's unreserved embrace of market economy after the 1980s, TV production has been internationalized, and sporadic cases of overseas trade have taken place. Joining the WTO compelled Chinese TV officials to face increasing challenges from global broadcasters which led them to formulate the ""going-global"" policy to encourage large scale of TV exportation. China, now, has displayed its aspiration to increase its TV exportation, or put it more ambitiously, to ""centralize"" a regional Chinese cultural market, including the areas of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and possibly Korean and Japan. This paper adopts a historical analysis of the trend of China's TV exportation. It involves the discussion of the officials' motivation in the ""going-global"" policy-making process, the marketing strategies of Chinese producers who aim at overseas trade, the types of TV dramas which have been particularly produced to circulate abroad, as well as the consumption of these exported TV dramas by overseas audiences. Based on current situation, this paper argues that it would be too optimistic to conclude that China has been able to be the center for this regional market, either culturally or economically. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","China; Export; Regional market; TV drama"

The original scale consists of 21 items and 5 factors that include usefulness, ease of use, social effect, facilitating conditions and community identity. An online sample of 109 Facebook users completed an internet version of the translated the scale from the USA, Germany, Turkey, and Canada. For the scale's structural validity, first and second order confirmatory factor analysis was conducted. Cronbach's Alpha coefficients (0.90) and item total correlations were calculated to investigate reliability of the scale. Through validity study it was proven that English version of the scale was consisted of five factors. But as a result of the second order confirmatory factor analysis, correlation between social influence variable and adoption variable was found to be insignificant. Therefore, two items included in the social influence factor were extracted from scale. The results indicated that the English version of the Social Networks Adoption Scale consisting of 19 items and 5 factors provided valid and reliable measures of social networks adoption.

The timely analysis and monitoring of business processes are essential to identify non-compliant situations and react immediately to those inconsistencies in order to respond quickly to competitors. In this regard, the integration of business intelligence (BI) systems with Process Aware Information Systems (PAIS) can become a key tool for business users in decision making. However, current BI systems are not suitable for optimising and improving end-to-end processes since these are normally business domain specific and are not sufficiently process-aware to support the needs of process improvement type activities. In addition, highly transactional business environments may produce vast amounts of event data that cannot be efficiently managed by the use of traditional storage systems which are not designed to manage vast amounts of event data. We introduce a cloud-based architecture that leverages big-data technology to support performance analysis on any business domain, in a timely manner and regardless of the underlying concerns of the operational systems. Likewise, we demonstrate the ability of the solution to provide real-time business activity monitoring on big-data environments with low hardware costs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Through an interpretative case study, it seeks to reveal some of the contradictions present in this process and discuss them within the ANT framework. It can be argued that public debate concerning NN has revealed acute internal contradictions between interest groups and created disputes between actors from different levels of this network, which requires a constant rearrangement of positions. The findings of this study suggest the need of socio-ecological transition by fostering social consensus but also dialogue and competition while actively taking economic and industrial constraints and opportunities simultaneously into account.

In addition to document analysis, this study interviewed stakeholders (e.g. NBTC policymakers, broadcaster and cable TV operators). The socio-technical analyses show that the NBTC prioritized digital television transition and imposed substantive government/policy support. Comparatively, Internet Protocol television (IPTV) and mobile TV which are driven by the industry/market subsystem have sluggish regulatory advancements. The interview results show that the NBTC is likely to regulate multi-screen TV services' contents and platforms separately as a result of complexity. Hence, this study recommends a platform-neutral approach to regulate audiovisual media categorized by socio-cultural impact and content production/aggregation model. It suggests that Thailand's TV-like services which can reach a mass market and produce/aggregate contents/services via a gatekeeping mechanism should be subject to strict content regulations and licensing schemes. However, light-touch regulations in content and licensing are suitable for governing emerging TV-like services which utilize a participatory content model with less socio-cultural impact.

Among numerous categories of mobile Apps, social Apps were one of those with the greatest growth in 2013. Despite abundant research on users' behavior intention of mobile App usage, few studies have focused on investigating key determinants of users' continuance intention regarding social Apps. To fill this gap, we integrated customer value perspectives to explore the influential factors in the continuance intention of social App use. Moreover, users' satisfaction and habit from both the marketing and psychology literature were also incorporated into the research model. A total of 378 valid questionnaires were collected by survey method, and structural equation modeling was employed in the subsequent data analysis. The results indicate that the continuance usage of social Apps is driven by users' satisfaction, tight connection with others, and hedonic motivation to use the Apps. In addition, full mediation effects of satisfaction and habit were found between perceived usefulness and intention to continue use. These findings extend our understanding of users' continuance intention in the context of social Apps.

The interplay of costs, trust and loyalty has also been shown for the telecommunications industry, but the recent smartphone revolution challenges existing theorizing. As consumers with smartphones collect and share more data including location information, increasing privacy and security risks make consumer trust even more important. Moreover, consumers with smartphones spend less on voice calling and text messages since they switch to over-the-top services, which changes the relationship that consumers have with their mobile operator. This paper studies the impact of perceived costs and trust in operators on the loyalty that consumers express towards their operator. We analyse a representative sample of 549 Dutch consumers, of which 25% own a smartphone. The effect of trust on loyalty is significant and consistent across smartphone owners and non-owners. Perceived costs have an indirect effect on loyalty, mediated by trust, but this indirect effect is fully moderated by smartphone ownership. Practical implication is that maintaining consumers' trust continues to be important to retain their loyalty, and especially smartphone owners should be offered tariffs that consumers consider fair. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Because of increased awareness that online-game addiction is a legitimate concern, understanding why and how people become addicted to online games is crucial. Our research model was empirically evaluated using survey data collected from online-game users. The partial least squares method of structural equation modeling was used to examine the research hypothesis. The findings reveal that mediated motives (entertainment, passing time, and escape) and interpersonal motives (social interaction and coplaying) significantly influence flow experiences, which in turn influence addiction. In addition, this study implies that interpersonal motives influence the flow of online-game players more than mediated motives do. Previous studies have mainly focused on the negative effects of addiction, whereas this paper proposes that online-game addiction is crucial for flow. The findings of this study elucidate some crucial determinants of player addiction that have not been addressed by previous research. The behavior of online-game players has become a critical concern for online-game designers and providers. Therefore, researchers increasingly believe that understanding online-game player behavior is crucial to the success of online-game providers. This study suggests that online-game designers and providers must determine strategies for building interactive experiences that engage players and enhance interpersonal interactivity. This is a pilot study to empirically examine the role of flow experiences as well as its antecedents in online games by conceptualizing computer-mediated communication motives.

We bring an attachment theory from social psychology literature to understand how online members exchange their information. We studied information sharing behavior in groups on SNSs from the perspective of information contributors and their characteristics by using the lens of identity-and bond-based attachment theory. We collected 502 data using an online survey of the members who joined groups (open, closed, secret) such as school alumni in South Korea. We tested with a structural equation model (SEM) for research model by AMOS using the survey data. Network externality, social interaction, enjoyment of helping, and self-image expression are significant for the two types of attachments. Interestingly, identity-based attachment showed much stronger impact on information sharing. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examines how and whether mobile phones narrow the digital divide among Indonesian people at four levels (device ownership, Internet adoption, use, and information acquisition). A self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted in three large cities in Indonesia (N = 605). The results indicated that, at different levels, younger and more educated people utilize mobile Internet, especially via smartphones. In contrast, feature phones are owned by less educated and older people regardless of income level, but Internet usage on such phones is more prevalent among younger and more educated people. Moreover, the adoption of the PC-based Internet promotes the ownership of smartphones. These results indicate that mobile leapfrogging is the case only with the ownership of feature phones. Furthermore, in comparison with feature phones, smartphones and personal computers are more associated with information handling capacity in daily life. These findings suggest that ICT literacy education is important, and one should not be optimistic about the mobile Internet's prospects for narrowing the digital divide in developing countries. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It considers the extent to which the role of the broadcast channel - traditionally the main vector via which audiences have enjoyed television content - may now be threatened by the rise of online rivals and accompanying pressures to adjust to a digital multiplatform environment. Drawing on the experience of BBC Three, the research question it asks is: to what extent is there an economic justification for switching from 'the channel' as the distribution format to an online-only service? The original findings presented are based on analysis of the finances of BBC Three, on evidence gathered through a series of in-depth interviews carried out with senior executives at the BBC, and on analysis of secondary source data and public policy statements and performance reviews. They provide an empirically based contribution to knowledge about how growth of the internet is prompting public service suppliers of media to reconsider and adjust their strategies for distribution of television content and, more generally, to understanding of contemporary strategies for re-invention and survival in the television industry. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Broadcast channels; Digital delivery; Multiplatform; Public service media; Television distribution"

Thus, in order to provide better academic achievement, more and more instructors are adapting collaborative learning to their classes. Collaborative learning, by definition, means that students have to become socially active and achieve learning goals in a group-based environment. The benefits of collaborative learning include learning concepts more effectively, encouraging more participation, improving learning satisfaction, developing teamwork skills, and promoting higher-order thinking. However, it is difficult to apply collaborative learning because students tend to engage passively with traditional lectures. As a result, interactive technologies such as clickers have been applied to increase interactive learning and raise the rate of interaction. Nevertheless, these interactive technologies still have some limitations, such as limited mobility, high costs, setup issues, technical difficulties, and little support of higher-order thinking skills. Technology is accelerating at an exponential rate, so almost every student now lives with a smartphone. Therefore, we have designed the Smartphone-Supported Collaborative Learning System (SSCLS), which includes the MyResponse mobile app and the Delphi method. SSCLS not only addresses the limitations of mobile technologies, but also achieves collaborative learning. In this study, we first provide detailed implementation of MyResponse mobile app and explain how we apply it to increase the rates of in-class participation and interaction. Next, we describe how we apply the Delphi method to develop students' knowledge and promote higher-order thinking. Then, we explain how we utilize SSCLS in a course to achieve five cognitive processes from Bloom's revised taxonomy and facilitate the construction of knowledge. Furthermore, we ask students to evaluate their experiences and provide feedback about SSCLS. Based on students' overall feedback, we finally conclude that SSCLS can support collaborative learning. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The system mainly consists of improved watershed transform and modified vector quantization. Improved watershed transform is proposed to segment a medical image into several closed regions via region growing, which can achieve more efficient computation and classification. Modified vector quantization is proposed to analyze these regions with different compression rates according to the importance of the regions to simultaneously preserve important features and reduce the size of images. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system is robust and performs better than several previous methods.

There are some indications that accessible and affordable technologies that allow the sharing of multimedia may attract interest from new groups of users, namely for marketing and by people who use mobile phones to take photographs but currently cannot share them easily and affordably. The question raised in this paper is whether the nature of these technologies has made the well-established theories and models of technology adoption obsolete. The constructs used come from the Diffusion of Innovation Model (DIM) and the extensions to it and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and 'the constructs of cost and perceived enjoyment are added. The data obtained from South African university students was analysed according to whether they classify themselves as innovator, early adopter, early majority or late majority adopters of Multimedia Message Services. Different factors were found to be significant for different diffusion groups but cost and perceived enjoyment (neither of which come from DIM or UTAUT) were significant for the majority. A second comparison was done for current users versus non-users and social influence was found to be significant for current users only; non-users identified perceived enjoyment (positively) and results demonstrability (negatively). The results were then compared with a similar study carried out in Taiwan by Hsu et al. (2007) and differences between the two studies highlight the importance of time, place and the respondents selected.

The specific factors of the UDSS that this study focuses on include the connectivity and context-awareness function, which were not considered in previous research on the adoption of UDSS. Accordingly, this study empirically explores this research question by using the scanphone-based ubiquitous delivery system (UDS), which many delivery service providers have been adopting recently as a form of the ubiquitous decision support system (UDSS). The results reveal that connectivity, context-awareness function, and perceived values play meaningful roles in the UDSS.

The last decade has seen emergence of a new economy called Knowledge Economy, a fusion of globalization and Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Educationally advanced countries such as South Korea, USA, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, European Union and Australia are using mobile devices in the educational sectors. These countries have been found promoting Mobile Learning (M-Learning) as a matter of national policies. They have accommodated E-Learning and M-Learning in their traditional learning systems. However most of the Middle East countries are still out of race and facing number of challenges in M-Learning adoption. A critical review of educationally advanced countries suggests that adoption of M-Learning is influenced by country specific as well as individual constraints. As a consequence five important lessons have been drawn from these countries, national level initiatives, public and private partnership, characteristics of learners and cultural norms, M-Learning infrastructure, and awareness. This paper is intended to help policymakers of the educationally less advanced countries to overcome the challenges of M-Learning, following the footsteps of educationally advanced countries. The review concludes with the discussion of five lessons in the context of the Middle East, assigning priority the most important being the national level objective, followed by M-Learning awareness, partnership between public and private entities. Also learners' characteristics and cultural norms, M-Learning infrastructure, policymakers must evaluate when making decisions about M-Learning adoption. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous research has shown how visualizations of Facebook friends are useful, but mainly focused on the instrumental goal of controlling access. It is unclear, however, what value users themselves see in visualizations and whether knowledge and/or control are important to them. In this research, these questions were studied by evaluating FreeBu, a semi-automatic and interactive grouping technology that visualizes Facebook friends. The results indicate that audience visualizations are especially perceived useful for grouping and reflection purposes. Moreover, we found how users are attracted to larger groups, those with whom they communicate more, bridges and outliers in their network. The combined findings suggest that awareness is considered at least as important as control. Therefore, a shift from audience control to audience transparency is recommended. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach CFA and SEM analyses have been used to analyze the data collected from university students. The study strives to examine the role of technological and environmental variables in predicting behavioral intention of individuals to adopt mobile banking by integrating three pre-established frameworks of UTAUT, TTF and ITM. Findings The empirical findings established the significant contribution of task (TAC) and technology characteristics (TEC) in facilitating task technology fit (TTF). Initial trust is also found to be facilitated by structural assurance (SA) and familiarity with bank (FB). The statistical results also support the significant association of task technology fit (TTF), initial trust (IT) and facilitating condition (FC) with intention to adopt m-banking. Originality/value The present study provides an all-inclusive approach to understand the acceptance of mobile banking by incorporating three established theories of technology acceptance. The existing literature on mobile banking emphasizes greatly on the perception aspects of technology and hardly studies the impact of the task technology fit. The strength of present research lies in combining behavioral, technological and environmental aspects of mobile banking. This is evidenced by high explanatory power of our research model that depicted 60.1% of the behavioral intention to adopt m-banking compared to 31% by Kim et al. (2009) and 53% by Oliveira et al.

The reverse salients of WiBro were identified according to the activities of the actors from three different domains: technology, government, and business. The findings and implication of this study were obtained through a review of the literature and in-depth interviews with eight key experts. The reverse salients found can be categorized into two types: 'apparent' and 'underlying'. The apparent reverse salients are the lack of investment and inadequate business model of the business actors. The underlying reverse salients are the policies enacted by government actors and are less obvious but heavily influence the creation of the apparent reverse salients and ultimately contribute to the failure of WiBro. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This process is discussed in relation to the case of Optus ""TV Now"" in Australia, a cloud-based mobile television service that was subject to successful legal action to prevent its operation. The service was found to infringe the intellectual property rights of two major football leagues and a powerful telecommunications incumbent, Telstra. The details of this case study highlight the concentration of market power in the Australian telecommunications sector, and the high level of strategic value placed upon sports content in the development and delivery of new mobile media services.

This is different from the telecommunication networks model where a new service traditionally used to require new network architecture to be established (Yoo, 2012). However, the digitalization of services and products offered over the telecom infrastructure allows us to observe an emergent phenomenon of increased vertical integration on the Internet as well as the creation of further service specialization opportunities for telecom operators and users (Liebenau et al., 2011). We propose in this paper that this development and change in the way services are provided, leads to a new type of Internet - an addition to the current best effort Internet. We illustrate our proposition by presenting the case study of the Internet in Norway, analysing 166 of the approximately 40.000 independent AS numbers registered worldwide as catering for end-to-end services. The paper categorizes the Norwegian AS numbers according to size and type of services. Through our analyses two major groups of actors can be identified, each of them seeking to gain strategic advantage from the current Internet traffic growth: (1) Content providers and hosts seek to have a highly reliable network access with a minimal set of traffic or transmission costs. One action is to acquire AS numbers and use settlement-free peering agreements for distribution of their traffic, which is possible in traffic exchange regimes rooted in symmetry, slowly becoming asymmetric; (2) Internet access providers (IAPs) seek to take control over incoming traffic growth by hosting content within their own network and thereby to rebalance traffic and create new revenue streams with content hosting and premium end-to-end connection on-net. Our findings support the hypothesis that Internet is becoming both more vertically integrated and converged, and more specialized or modularized (Clark et al., 2004). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The majority of the studies on social media usage are based on the individual perspective while some are from the organizational perspective. However, not many studies have investigated the actual impact of social media usage on organizational performance. Therefore, using the qualitative approach, this study investigates the various purposes of social media usage and its impact on organizational performance. This study however, focuses only on the social media managers' views. The senior managers of six organizations that are using social media are interviewed from which we find that social media is used for various purposes in organizations, such as advertising and promotion, branding, information search, building customer relations and many more. The results also show that social media has a greater impact on the performance of organizations in terms of enhancement in customer relations and customer service activities, improvement in information accessibility and cost reduction in terms of marketing and customer service. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Facebook; Impact; Organizational performance; Social media; Social network sites; Twitter; Usage; Web 2.0"

In particular, media information has been found to encourage people to support the recovery efforts. However, the mechanisms underlying this process have not been thoroughly investigated. Such knowledge is essential for both governments and non-governmental organisations so that they may apply these findings in post-disaster recovery. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to conduct an in-depth investigation on how mass and social media can influence people's perceptions of a disaster and their behavioural intentions with respect to post-disaster recovery activities. This study uses the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake as a case study, and employs structural equation modelling with a data set of 2047 samples collected from an original Internet survey. Through the lens of cultivation theory, we find that mass and social media can play different roles and exert different influences on people's perceptions of the disaster. Mass media, specifically television is found to be the most influential, especially on those not directly affected by the disaster. Social media, on the other hand, although with a much weaker effect, can resonate more with those who were directly affected. Further, a positive perception of strong bonds in families and society as a result of media exposure is found to be the most effective in increasing the intention to participate in activities related to recovery such as boosting civic communications, taking altruistic actions and preparing for future disasters. The findings have implications for post-disaster recovery, in that they can provide a roadmap on how information via mass and social media can be used to motivate and connect the general public and the disaster victims. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Behavioural intention; Cultivation effect; Mass media; Perception of reality; Post-disaster recovery; Social media"

Applying the elaboration likelihood model (ELM), we adopted a confirmatory approach using partial least squares as the analytical method. Respondents (n = 357) who had recently purchased a tourism product using mobile devices (smartphones or tablets) were analyzed. Argument quality significantly influences perceived usefulness (central route); source credibility has positive effects on perceived usefulness and site attachment (peripheral route); perceived usefulness significantly influences site attachment and continued usage; and site attachment has a positive effect on continued usage. Social network involvement has a moderating effect on central and peripheral routes. This study reflects increased awareness and interest in understanding persuasive processes at work in MTS. Empirical results demonstrate the value of using the ELM to understand dual-route communication processes at work among mobile shoppers for tourism products. As markets become increasingly competitive, it becomes ever more important for tourism managers to better understand the persuasive processes at work among different segments of MTS. As this study demonstrates, applying the ELM holds promise in achieving such understanding.","Attachment; Central route; Elaboration likelihood model; Mobile tourism shopping; Peripheral route; Social network involvement"

Multilevel analysis of the time-varying and -constant study variables suggests that, in spite of a sharp decrease in the average/median number of outgoing SMS between the first and the last study month, customer heterogeneity with regard to the relationship between MI and SMS use intensities is very large. The number of customers with a negative within-person regression slope for MI data volume is almost as high as the number of consumers, whose slope is positive. Subscribers, who are most likely to reduce their SMS volume in parallel to an increase of their MI data traffic, are persons, who (1) are heavy SMS users in the initial study period (October 2011), (2) are female, (3) have a longer MNO tenure, (4) are currently in an SMS flat price scheme, (5) are presently equipped with an Apple iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy smart phone and (6) put their current handset into operation more recently.

The current E-Government 2.0 describes user-oriented portal services that are integrated into and provided through one portal site using Web 2.0 technologies, such as RSS, blogs, social networks, etc.; and that are accessible from various channels. However, building E-Government 2.0 is difficult because the transition from E-Government to E-Government 2.0 should be an organizational integration agenda, not only a technology one. Agencies may encounter many unpredictable design challenges and tensions that must be managed. Governments are now beginning to focus on the larger and more holistic task of service innovation in order to provide more productive and better services. One of the key observations about making progress with service innovation is that agencies need a framework to help them move forward.

The present study use a hybrid approach to access the relative efficiency based on fuzzy AHP and DEA model. The fuzzy AHP is used to determine weights of the consumer's preference as criteria and DEA method is used to identify the inefficient service providers in terms of efficiency. Findings of the study suggest that the most preferred value that determines consumer's preference by mobile subscribers is network parameters, followed by low tariff scheme. Our results also show that technical efficiency and technical progress indicator are the main factors of resources allocation of Indian telecom industry.

The findings indicate that the number of product attributes and the degree of information novelty exhibit an inverted U-shaped relationship with intention to explore, whereas the number of brand alternatives and degree of information novelty exhibit an inverted U-shaped relationship with intention to buy. The number of brand alternatives and information recipient load exhibit a positive relationship with intention to explore, whereas the number of product attributes and information recipient load are positively associated with intention to buy.

The attributes of an improved mobile service that we investigate in our experiment are: increased mobile internet speed (possible with 4G), unlimited mobile internet use, improved quality (possible with 4G) and unrestrained use in two neighbouring countries (unrestrained roaming). We collect the data for the choice experiment through a face-to-face survey held in all districts of North Cyprus. The results indicate that people value unrestrained roaming services the most. Increased speed and unlimited use attributes are next, and are similarly significant at the 1% level. The impact of improved quality is statistically insignificant at the 5% level, suggesting that consumers are content with the current level of quality they receive with 3G.

It enables individuals to engage in social, economic, leisure and entertainment activities including wider access to information. Due to extensive societal use of the Internet, those without access are clearly disadvantaged. They will lack the necessary information to make decisions, forgo the savings from shopping online and limit their opportunities for social interaction. This paper investigates the role that libraries can play in providing free public Internet access. This role is examined within the context of Glasgow, a large post-industrial city in the United Kingdom where Internet adoption is lower than in comparable cities and where a large proportion of its population face a range of socio-economic hardships. Primary data was collected from library users in three areas of deprivation. Our analysis demonstrates the role that libraries play as the provider of public Internet access. It shows that this role is not without its difficulties - inadequate levels of resources have been provided to fulfill the multiple roles that libraries perform in these communities. Libraries enable users to engage in a wide array of online activities, the range of which reflects both the push of government policies and the pull of innovative services. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The results of the one-way ANOVA and Scheffe's post-hoc comparisons demonstrate significant differences in groups with different network connection types across demographic lines, different levels of Internet usage, and different communication competences. The results of the multinomial regression show significant differences across the variables between wired-only users and wired and smartphone users as well as between wired-only users and wired, wireless, and smartphone users. However, group differences between wired and smartphone users and wired, wireless, and smartphone users are significant only in device ownership and creative skill. We concluded that smartphone use was likely to aggravate the gaps of demographics, access, and skills in the seamlessly connected media environment. Meanwhile, access gap made the most impact on information, communication, leisure/entertainment, and financial management activities online, followed by skill and demographic gaps. The findings imply that access and skill gaps could be higher barriers to the active engagement in diverse online activities and consequently create an overlapping effect on the established divide. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Access gap; Communication competence; Demographic disparity; Online activity; Smartphone use"

The present investigation tries to fill this gap by conceptualizing, developing, and validating a new construct, which we referred to as social networking time use scale (SONTUS). To achieve this, two separate studies were conducted. The data for the first study was collected from 2049 individuals through quota sampling approach. Meanwhile, in this first study, we used exploratory factor analysis to identify the dimension of the SONTUS construct. Findings from this study reveal that SONTUS has five factors with good measurement properties. The main aim of the second study (where we utilized data from 1808 people) is to carry out a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and tests three hypothesized models. In addition, it aims to investigate the construct validity of SONTUS; and to achieve this, we used 10 personality and well-being measures, and two theoretically related constructs to SONTUS. The CFA results showed that SONTUS has five factor solution consisting of 29 items and that the model with 5 first-order factors with 1 second-order factor is the most suitable model for the study population. Additionally, the second study provides preliminary evidence for the convergent, predictive, and incremental validity of SONTUS. Overall, the findings from our exploratory (study 1) and confirmatory (study 2) studies shows that SONTUS can be used as a standardized instrument for measuring time spent on sites. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Considering the rapid growth in online communication with the advent of virtual mediums, and the lack of attention this receives in developing countries, this empirical research examines the impact of online communication on consumers' buying intentions. The study investigated the outcomes of online word-of-mouth communication on consumers' preferences, the variables influencing an individual in using positive word-of-mouth, and their effect on consumers' attitudes and intentions to buy electronic products. The theoretical foundation for this study, the heuristic-systematic model and attitude formation theory, laid a strong framework for collecting data from 251 internet users, which covers six measures: speaker's trustworthiness, speaker's expertise, speaker's experience, word-of-mouth use, attitude and purchase intentions. Data analysis used confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling to understand the effect of exogenous variables over endogenous variables, and the effect of a mediator variable between two constructs.

Why do adolescents engage in bullying behaviors on MIMs in opposition to their attitude toward bullying? Generally, previous research has explored modest associations between attitude toward cyberbullying and cyberbullying behaviors. However, this study focuses on the moderating role played by peer-group pressure in MIMs group chats. An interaction effect between peer-group pressure and negative attitude toward MIMs bullying is hypothesized and demonstrated based on data (N = 424) gathered via a survey conducted in July 2014 of randomly selected students from South Korean high schools and junior high schools in South Korea. The findings support the effect of interaction between the attitude and peer-group pressure. Adolescents with a highly negative attitude toward MIMs bullying tended not to engage in MIMs bullying regardless of the level of peer-group pressure to which they perceived themselves to be subject. However, adolescents with a neutral or positive attitude toward MIMs bullying who perceived a high level of peer-group pressure engaged more in MIMs bulling behaviors than did those with a similarly neutral or positive attitude who perceived a low level of PGP. It was concluded that self-justification or self-persuasion on the part of adolescents possibly resulting from the logic of cognitive dissonance can bring about engagement in MIMs bullying behaviors even against adolescents' attitudes toward MIMs bullying. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

On the contrary, demand is now driving the market to the extent that it will not be easy for mobile operating companies to cope up with the demand to come in the near future. Operators are forced to make heavy investments to upgrade and expand their networks, which then squeezes profits, as the evolution of income is not parallel to that of demand. On the other hand, the operators simply cannot refuse to take up the challenge. To decide how to handle the present and upcoming demand, they need to identify and understand the characteristics of the scenarios they face and will be facing. This is precisely the aim of this article, which provides figures on the consequences for mobile infrastructures of a generalised mobile data services uptake. To achieve this, the article collects information about the predicted evolution of different mobile services in the current and coming years and translates those expectations into service requirements.

As a result, huge quantities of data about students' learning process have been recorded and stored. Teachers can apply data-mining techniques to mine students' learning performance. One such technique is association rule mining, which can find correlations between student characteristics and performance. For instance, a rule (Attendance = Middle) ^ (Gender = Male) → (Semester = Low) indicates that the semester grade of students is at the Low level if their gender is Male and attendance rate is Middle, where Low and Middle are predetermined linguistic terms given by teachers. Teachers can rely on such rules to formulate their teaching strategies. However, these rules may be varied in different semesters because of the change of student characteristics or teaching method of teachers. The above rule is used to describe student behavior during the last semester, yet, within this semester, the rule changes to (Attendance = Low) ^ (Gender = Female) → (Semester = Low). Without updating this knowledge, teachers might adopt inappropriate teaching strategies for students who are learning in different ways across different semesters. In this study, we propose a new change mining model to discover the change in student learning performance and characteristics on the basis of association rules. We conducted experiments with real-life datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Association rule; Change mining; Educational data mining; Learning performance; Teaching strategies"

Research shows that older adults increasingly use the mobile phone for maintenance and development of social interactions with their family members, peers, and caregivers as providers of emotional support and social companionship. Therefore, this study explores how retired older adults in Slovenia use mobile phones as personal devices for supportive communication as well as how the characteristics of their social support networks are related to the frequency of mobile phone communication with their network members. Using ego-centered social support network data, collected on a nationwide representative sample of retired older adults in Slovenia, this study found that the composition of emotional support and of social companionship networks scarcely predicts the frequency of mobile phone communication of older adults with their network members. Conversely, according to the results, it seems that more frequent in-person and landline phone communication with network members are positively associated with mobile phone communication, suggesting that older adults extend their communication sphere with a mobile phone in their support networks. Finally, the results indicate that sociodemographic characteristics of older adults, such as age, social-economic status, and living alone, significantly determine the frequency of mobile communication with their network members, even though their magnitude varies depending on the type of social support network. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As this assertion is presently unproven, the purpose of this analysis is to estimate the long-run relationship between ICT, energy consumption, and economic growth in Japan. Using an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach, we estimate two different multivariate models corresponding to the production function and the energy demand function, both including ICT investment as an explanatory variable, over the period 1980-2010. The results reveal the presence of a long-run stable relationship, not only for the production function, but also for the energy demand function. However, in the production function, the long-run coefficient estimate for ICT investment is statistically insignificant, unlike the coefficients for labor, stock, and energy. In the case of the energy demand function, the coefficients for GDP, energy price, and ICT investment are statistically significant.

The factors are explored as human values and the methodology how designers should take these values into account is examined. The results show that user intentions and behaviors are largely influenced by the perceived values of cloud services, which include availability, access, security and reliability. These values were found to be the significant antecedents of usefulness and ease of use in cloud computing. Theoretically, the model proposed in this paper advances the existing technology acceptance models and can be used to predict the acceptance and diffusion of cloud computing.

This channel is commonly known as mobile marketing and there is already a number of mobile marketing apps, whose aim is to increase the sales of some product or service. In this context, the Let's Meet! framework presented in this paper is essentially a mobile marketing app. The app groups two or more persons, who basically do not know each other, having as sole criterion their common interest in an offer about a product or a service. Its main objective is to bring them together, so that they can purchase and enjoy an offer, which otherwise could not afford. One of the highlights of our proposal is that all sensitive user data are transmitted in a secure manner, and thus confidentiality is preserved. Users' privacy is also given great consideration. This means for example that the exact geographic locations of the users are never shared with others. For user authentication, Let's Meet! supports both a complete anonymous mode and OAuth 2.0. The framework's main objective, which is to bring the users together, is guaranteed by means of a one-time coupon, generated by the OCRA algorithm, while the final face-to-face user group meeting is achieved through Wi-Fi Direct technology. Moreover, the app implements a smart queueing system for increasing its efficiency. Every possible effort is made to maximize both the number of products being sold and the number of users that eventually enjoy an offer. Finally, a user rating system has been adopted, which rewards any user attitude that helps towards improving the framework's competence. The above qualities make Let's Meet! a novel proposal when considering similar works in the literature so far. © 2015, Elsevier Ltd.

Through the context of users using the applications of smartphone, this study found that temporal dissociation moderates the satisfaction-continuance intention relationship negatively. However, focused immersion is not a moderator. There is a paucity of research into the implication of cognitive absorption for continued IT usage and the moderating role of temporal dissociation and focused immersion on relationship between satisfaction and continuance intention. This study fills these literature gaps. Though temporal absorption and focused immersion are often treated as two of the dimensions of cognitive absorption, handling them separately can provide useful insights on their dynamics. This study suggests that with many competing smartphone applications serving as substitutes, application software developers should not ignore the moderating role of temporal dissociation. They can design more applications that lead users to be unaware of the passage of time when using them.

Therefore, this study aims to further our understanding of the heterogeneity in adolescent mobile phone use by examining whether we can distinguish between different 'mobile lifestyles' within the Mobile Youth Culture. Drawing on a quantitative survey among 1943 Flemish adolescents (12-18 years), we differentiated three lifestyles based on their attitudes towards the mobile phone as a fashion article, as a display of one's popularity and as a display of one's time scarcity. A two-step cluster procedure based on respondents' scores on these three mechanisms revealed three different segments: trendy users (N = 603), engaged users (N = 864) and thrifty users (N = 436). These segments showed significantly different profiles in terms of socio-demographics, their use of the mobile phone in the presentation of the Self and the mobile phone's role in their friendship relationships. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper specifically considers the edition of this programme aired on April 14 in its coverage and monitoring of the conduct of the Oyo State gubernatorial (governorship) election held on that day. Realising that it cannot be everywhere and that people need be involved in the process of democracy, the Radio/Television station gave out some phone lines to which people could call to report their experiences of the conduct of the election in their localities. Participation of the people in this programme was possible because of the ubiquity, affordability and portability of radio sets and cell phones; and the proficiency of expression which the local language programme afforded them. Even at polling centres, people were able to monitor the programme with their transistor radios and were able to report their experiences with their cell phones. The harvest of election reports from this exercise was tremendous, and at the same time revealing. Reports that the professional journalists could not have been able to give because of the volatility of the political situation in the State were given live on air and uncensored by aggrieved electorate. There was also an informal inter-reports reliability (peer-review) mechanism in the sense that if a member of the public felt a particular report given by a particular caller was inaccurate and false, the unsatisfied member of the public would call into provide his own account of the happenings. The general public would then be left to decide on their own which of the accounts was more appropriate. Thus, in essence, a public sphere was created. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Literature on reinforcement and displacement suggests that the use of new media depends on whether users are inclined to replace or reinforce their existing media use on a new device. This paper analyzes whether the importance that users attribute to using similar services on their mobile phone as on the fixed Internet can explain the intention to adopt mobile services. Specifically, we investigate if such fixed-mobile reinforcement could mediate the impact of personal innovativeness and several dimensions of context. We compare basic Internet services, entertainment services and transaction services. We find that especially the intention to adopt basic Internet services largely depends on the importance of using similar services in the mobile domain as on the fixed Internet. Several context-of-use predictors are partially or even fully mediated by fixed-mobile reinforcement. The results convey a positive message to operators that are betting on converged multimedia services that can be accessed from any device and from any fixed or mobile network. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the study develops a model to predict on the motivation leading to consumer's intention to adopt mobile music services by extending Perceived Cost (PC), Perceived Credibility (PCr), Social Influence (SI), and Personal Innovativeness (INNO) with Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). 160 Respondents were tested using a multi-stage Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach. A non-linear non-compensatory Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) ANN with feed-forward back-propagation algorithm and ten cross-validation neural networks was deployed in order to capture the motivators of mobile music adoption. All predictor variables were found to have relevance to the output neuron based on the non-zero synaptic weights connected to the hidden neurons. The RMSE values indicated that the ANN models were able to predict the motivators with very high accuracy. The ANN models have out-performed the MRA models as they are able to capture the non-linear relationships between the predictor and criterion variables. While the study found that TAM is a significant predictor, the insignificance linear relationships of PCr and INNO requires further investigation.

This development raises the question of how LTE service subscribers may differ from 3G service subscribers. Within the context of this rapidly changing environment of mobile service markets, this study examines the validity of the traditional determinants of customer satisfaction in data-service oriented mobile communications markets, analyzes the effects of customer satisfaction and switching costs on customer loyalty, and assesses the difference between 3G and LTE subscribers with respect to their determinants of customer loyalty. The results show that there are significant differences between 3G and LTE subscribers while traditional factors such as call quality, data quality, customer support, and price perception are still significant determinants of customer satisfaction. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Participants viewed a staged video of a public conversation and later rated their perceptions of the conversation and target speaker. Two variables were manipulated: whether the conversation took place over a mobile phone or was face-to-face, and whether participants could hear both sides or only one side of the conversation. In general, participants rated the one side mobile phone conversation as more noticeable, intrusive, and annoying than the other conditions. Additionally, the target speaker in this condition was less well-liked than the speaker in the other conditions. Perceptions of the target's extraversion varied as a function of whether the conversation occurred on a mobile phone or not. Overall, the results suggest the existence of negative views toward mobile phones and exposure to one side of a conversation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It specifically explores how the use of the Internet (and its associated digital technologies), including the mobile phone by two prominent 'underground' radio stations, Short Wave (SW) Radio Africa and Voice of America's Studio 7, beaming into Zimbabwe from the UK and the US, respectively, has impacted on the reception of their content. Drawing on reception theory, the paper highlights the ambiguities and complexities associated with the reception of (pirate) radio in the era of convergence in Africa. It argues that while both SW Radio Africa and Studio 7's multiple digital transmission strategies have broadened the range of options available for the reception of their content (albeit in disproportionate ways), traditional forms of reception remain in force. This is largely because of enduring questions of access to digital technologies (especially the Internet), and the lasting connections between traditional live radio and the oral traditions of local culture. These contextual factors sustain reception practices that differ markedly from the scenario in the economically developed world of the North where digital technologies have radically redefined radio reception practices. Similarly, the mobile phone has expanded options for the generation and reception of news content from the radio stations thus pointing to the fact that in Africa convergence can indeed assume unique forms, shaped by an intricate combination of local socio-economic and cultural factors. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The perceived affordances of reading and writing on paper and digitally are compared by analysing written essays collected from 25 communication students in 2013. Research design is replicated from a study of Fortunati and Vincent that concerns Italian students. Results show that Finnish students perceive more positive than negative affordances regarding reading on paper, while reading on screen attracts fewer virtues. In this respect, results are in line with the Italian study. Unlike in Italy, students in Finland value writing on a keyboard especially because it enables editing the text quickly and efficiently and thus increases textual productivity. The study shows that Finnish students take some affordances of digital writing for granted and do not recognise their non-digital alternatives. This implies that they are perhaps more embedded in the digital world than Italian students. The Technological Frames approach is utilised to expound these country differences. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Peer-to-peer (P2P) social dynamics generate public information available worldwide in digital repositories, websites and bibliographic resources. However, processing such amount of data is not achievable by a single central-controlled system. We claim that distributed and heterogeneous networks of coordinated mechanisms, composed by both specialized human and artificial agents, are needed to improve information retrieval, knowledge inference and decision-making, but also to produce social value, goods and services. Handling these issues implies the collective construction of global semantic networks but also the active labor of knowledge producers and consumers. We conclude that information literacy is as much important as any technical implementation and, therefore, may lead to networks of Commons-oriented communities which would utilize P2P infrastructures. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Our focus is on the effect of normative peer influence on a college student's smartphone adoption. We also examine the influence of other factors such as self-innovativeness, self-efficacy, the decision maker's attitudes towards a product, financial burden of using the product, familial influence, and other demographic factors (e.g.; age and gender). College students' adoption behavior is studied using logit and probit choice models developed based on random utility theory. The discrete choice models are empirically estimated using survey data.

The focus is on the bodily aspects of these practices. Reading and writing are viewed as techniques of the body, which over the years have become increasingly mediated by technologies. The analysis is grounded in the theory of social practice. Research material consists of written essays collected from 25 students at the University of Jyväskylä, Finland, in 2013. Results show that paper as material is considered suitable and adaptive to numerous reading purposes and bodily positions, while regarding the screen the places and positions of reading are viewed as more limited due to the material boundary conditions presented by devices. Students describe handwriting as a more flexible and relaxed bodily practice than typing, although the worsening skills of handwriting are recognized too. Skills and competences turned out to be less decisive factors than materials and images when trying to explain the differences in reading and writing practices when a paper/pen is compared with a keyboard/screen.

In critical situations or crowd aggregations, this may result difficult or even impossible due to the inaccuracy of verbal communication, the lack of precise localization for the medical events, and/or the failure/congestion of infrastructure-based communication networks. In such a scenario, a temporary (ad hoc) wireless network for disseminating medical alarms to the closest hospital, or medical field personnel, can be usefully employed to overcome the mentioned limitations. This is particularly true if the ad hoc network relies on the mobile phones that people normally carry, since they are automatically distributed where the communication needs are. Nevertheless, the feasibility and possible implications of such a network for medical alarm dissemination need to be analysed. To this aim, this paper presents a study on the feasibility of medical alarm dissemination through mobile phones in an urban environment, based on realistic people mobility. The results showed the dependence between the medical alarm delivery rates and both people and hospitals density. With reference to the considered urban scenario, the time needed to delivery medical alarms to the neighbour hospital with high reliability is in the order of minutes, thus revealing the practicability of the reported network for medical alarm dissemination. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The children were asked about their access to the digital devices, whether they sought permission from parents as well as parental rules with regard to the usage. There is high home computer access of 96%. Children reported using personal computers mainly for playing games and for e-learning. All children interviewed reported having access to mobile phones. However, only 57% reported having access to tablet devices. Most of the children reported that they sought parental permission for use of these devices. There seems to be more parental rules for computer use than for mobile and tablet devices, the most common rules being not to play games until completion of homework, and health concerns such as having enough rest and not to strain the eyes.

This study adopted TMS to understand the intentions of tourists who share travel information in social media. Tourist's information is shared either by the formal or informal types of communication. To understand their intentions in using social media, this paper concerns the three measurements employed by TMS; that is, specialization, credibility, and coordination; and the potential tourists' perception of communication types and TMS are measured in this research model. This research employed empirical analysis using structural equation modeling upon 309 Korean users who shared travel information on social media to attain three findings. First, that the users' perception of formal communication has a positive influence on the specialization, credibility, and coordination of social media. Second, that the perception of informal communication has a positive effect on the credibility and coordination of social media. Third, that three sub-dimensions of TMS affect intentions to share travel information, which provides us with significant theoretical and practical implications. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the e-learning user data collected through a survey, structural equations modeling (SEM) and path analysis were employed to test the research model. The results revealed that ""intention"" and ""user satisfaction"" both had positive effects on actual use of e-learning. ""System quality"" and ""information quality"" were found to be the primary factors driving users' intentions and satisfaction towards use of e-learning. E-learning outcomes such as actual use and perceived learning assistance were positively predicted by satisfaction and intention. At last, ""perceived usefulness"" mediated the relationship between ease of use and users' intentions. The sample consisted of e-learning users of four public universities in Iran.

It explores the affordances of writing and reading on paper and those of writing on a keyboard and reading on a screen. The analysis is based on an exploratory study carried out with a class of Masters Students in Multimedia Communication and Technologies of Information at the University of Udine (Italy) who were asked to write an essay on this topic. The methodology applied in this study is qualitative content analysis of the essays produced by the students. The principal results of this study show that reading and writing competencies are changing with the use of digital technologies but that paper and digital interactions are not mutually exclusive. Students are more productive textually with writing than with reading, however, they still see the virtues of writing on paper which they continue to use extensively. It appears that chirographic writing and paper is more multi-sensorial and meta-communicative than using the keyboard or screen.

Sensing the tendency toward technological determinism, a position which Castells warns is fraught with failure to recognize complex interactions between society and technology; authors examined popular press vis-à-vis scholarly assumptions about the value of media during social movements. Questions that critically analyze the roles and power of old versus new media in social movements should be posed particularly about 21st century iterations with citizens increasingly doubling as creators and disseminators of news and information. For example: to what extent do various media comparatively facilitate or constrain activists in social movements? How have new ICTs assisted citizen activists in circumventing the power and reach of traditional media? How have the roles of traditional versus new media in social movements been framed in the popular press and academic journals? What contextual factors (e.g., communal networks; third-party- and foreign-interventions, digital divide, etc.) may be accountable for the take-off and successes of social movements? In a continent fraught with cultural, political, and socio-economic divisions of historic proportions, authors critically assessed cases across Africa of variegated employment of old (i.e., radio, newspaper, television) and new media platforms (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, mobile telephone text messaging) by four social movements spanning 35 years. Assessments underscore citizen empowerment and multiplier capabilities of new media but affirm the value of contextual factors that minimize hyperbolic assumptions about the contribution of new media to the formation and progression of social movements. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

During the election, the unpopularity of the candidates and several candidate-related scandals led to the proliferation of online user-generated satire. This study asks whether exposure to such content affected young people's candidate evaluations. More important, it examines whether online satire exposure also influenced attitude toward the electoral system. It is further hypothesized that political knowledge and interpersonal discussion may facilitate processes of elaboration that allow people to develop critiques of the electoral system based on the candidate-centered satire. Analysis of a survey on university students finds that online satire exposure did relate significantly to candidate evaluation, while a positive relationship between online satire exposure and critical attitude toward the electoral system exists among respondents who discussed the election with others. Contrary to expectation, ability to identify individual politicians, a type of political knowledge, undermined the linkage between online satire exposure and critical attitude toward the election. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

They justify this costly endeavor of rolling out fiber to the home (FTTH) networks in believing that state-of-the-art ICT infrastructure will function as a growth engine, bridge the digital divide and increase quality of living. In the meantime, they believe it to be simply indispensable because an ever increasing demand for bandwidth-intensive applications is anticipated. The former goals, however, can only be achieved if citizens and companies alike migrate to this new technology. Hence, it is essential to consider the utility of fiber networks for future users and to explore applications that can convince end-users to migrate from their current connections to high-bandwidth networks. By means of an international expert survey, this paper tries to identify value-added services that benefit from fiber's network potential and that can stimulate users to switch to fiber. Health monitoring, online content storage and management services, and desktop sharing were identified as the most promising fiber applications in the short term based on a combination of technological feasibility, time to reach the mass market and overall persuasiveness.

These two types of costs are interrelated and affect any service provider's deployment strategy. In many traditional methods, selection of critical elements of a new service is performed in a heuristic manner aimed at reducing only the OPEX part of the TCO which is not necessarily optimal. Furthermore, exact cost modeling for such services is not always possible and contains some uncertainties. In the current work, the TCO optimization problem for video streaming over IP networks is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem using cost modeling of each video streaming element and capturing the effect of the model uncertainties. The solution of the proposed optimization problem can cope with the cost modeling uncertainties and track the dynamic features of the TCO and lead to a time-varying optimal solution. Numerical analysis results verify the developed method and analyze its sensitivity to input parameters variations. Using the proposed stochastic optimization approach, the video streaming service providers can improve their return on investment (ROI) through selecting the optimal number of the deployed edge servers in the presence of uncertainties in ownership costs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Many studies have made good progress on access control; however, their methods are inadequate to cope with this new issue for SGC-based WSNs since of their inflexibility, inefficiency, insecurity, or small-scale. This paper, based on cryptographic theory, develops a scheme to manage the group access key used in SGC-based WSNs. In comparison with previous studies, the proposed method provides two main advantages. First, regarding adaptability, the administrator can assign access privilege flexibly, regardless of whether the relation among entities is hierarchical, peer-to-peer or heterogeneous. Second, regarding scalability, when an entity joins or leaves such a WSN, the administrator can re-generate the secure filter function alone and then send it to the entities (i.e.; sensor nodes or base stations). While receiving this new secure filter function, the existing entities merely need to compute hash computation once to obtain the updating group access key, despite operating in an incremental system with a large number of entities. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, previous studies are limited in that they assume that the potential market and the final number of adopters are constant at the current market penetration level. By computational experiments, this research estimates the effect of network neutrality regulation considering the diffusion process of application services such as IPTV and VoIP.

A telephone survey, which yielded 753 valid questionnaires, was conducted to collect data. The results of this study show that the factors affecting the intention to adopt digital terrestrial television differed widely from those affecting the intention to adopt digital cable. The diffusion of digital cable was discovered to be generally congruent with the prediction of Rogers' model, while the diffusion of digital terrestrial television was not. This second finding reveals a limitation in Rogers' model, namely, its alleged pro-innovation bias. It may be that the respondents in this study looked favorably on digital cable because they considered it, and not digital terrestrial television, to be an inevitable technology. Furthermore, this study found that awareness played an important role in respondents' adoption of digital television.

Cloud computing also bears many other issues, particularly in the context of non-democratic countries. These issues may include security concerns associated with the use of shared resources, embedded control and monitoring systems, physical storage locations and their management as well as the tools and services that otherwise may give oppressive regimes the ability to impose yet more restrictive Internet access on their citizens. By applying Actor Network Theory, this study critically investigates the controversial national ""Halal Internet"" recently introduced in Iran.

With emphasis on the Internet and mobile phones, the paper focuses on three radio stations-Safm, Talk Radio 702, and Bush Radio. Drawing on theories of public spheres and theories of publics, the paper argues that ICTs have expanded communicative radio spaces and transformed the nature of audience engagement. Through these expanded spaces, radio stations increasingly view their listeners as publics rather than merely audiences, meaning that listeners now produce, circulate and share information in ways that allow them to organise themselves into a public around radio texts. While the argument in this paper has acknowledged the positive role of ICTs in expanding discursive spaces and transforming radio publics, realities of the digital divide in South Africa are not ignored. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This focus was initially caused by the short time frames in which key actors in the ICT4D field had to operate. Different authors acknowledge that the ICT4D ideology has to be reconceptualised, recognizing the fact that technology is not neutral and that context and cultural complexity need to be taken into account in its development. This article argues that the living lab approach, involving the end user in the process of problem identification, technology design, implementation and evaluation, might be a suitable approach to move towards a more participatory ICT4D framework. The underlying study investigates how a location-based and community-oriented mobile app could improve the quality of life of Tanzanian University students. The research was part of an ongoing living lab study in order to gain insights into the local context and ensure a user-centric approach. The outcomes suggest that a mobile app can support student life in several ways, but that location-based services are not likely to be massively adopted and infrastructural limitations should be taken into account. The results demonstrate that ICT4D projects can benefit from adopting participative practices and that living lab research is an adequate tool to do so. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Instead of transferring prescriptions to the insurance-contracted pharmacy (ICP) in the community, most of the patients still fill their prescriptions in the hospital or clinic. This is because the policy lacks the necessary supporting measures and incentives. Therefore, we propose a prescription-release information system (PRIS) that makes the prescription release more convenient under the governmental healthcare policy. This test-run system is integrated into the hospital information system (HIS) of Sinying Hospital, which allows the outpatient to choose a preferable pharmacy and transfer prescriptions there via the virtual private network (VPN) in a self-guided way. We posit that this PRIS is a major factor in the successful promotion of the SDMP policy. Therefore, a research model is built, and the corresponding survey is administered to validate our hypotheses. The results indicate that most of the respondents are satisfied with the PRIS and the SDMP and that the PRIS concretely supports the prevalence of the SDMP policy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, this work investigates personal characteristics and mobile Internet (MI) use behaviors of consumers who chose computer-centric appliance types for MI access. Two variants of tablet PCs (Apple's iPad1 and iPad2) and laptops are distinguished as computer-centric communication device categories. Data on two demographic variables, three MNO relationship characteristics and actual MI use intensity (average monthly volume of mobile IP traffic generated by a subscriber in May and June 2011) of 2001 consumers with a flat MI pricing scheme were extracted from customer files of the German subsidiary of a large international MNO. 1371, 367 and 263 of the sample members used an iPad1, an iPad2 and a laptop, respectively for MI access. Compared to the adult population in Germany, persons aged between 17 and 35 years and males are overrepresented among MI adopters with the three studied device types. MI use intensity is highly positively skewed: in each of the three appliance groups, a small number of users disproportionately contributes to the total MI traffic generated by the subjects. MI use intensity is the main variable discriminating between Apple tablet versus laptop MI subscribers. On average, laptop users generate three times more MI traffic than iPad customers. MI use intensity does not differ significantly between iPad1 and iPad2 customers. Age and length of business relationship with the collaborating MNO are the two only studied personal characteristics, which consistently display a significant (negative) association with MI use intensity across the three appliance groups. Conclusions are drawn for MNO on aligning marketing measures to the peculiarities of users with different types of computer-centric MI devices and for scholarly research seeking to enhance the understanding of the influence of various appliance categories on MI adoption and use behaviors. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, a better understanding of users' video request patterns is essential, in order to design an effective and efficient video distribution system (caching, storage capacity, bandwidth, etc.). In this paper, the core issue will be the analysis and modeling of video requests temporal redundancy. The study will be centered on a News-on-Demand (NoD) service, which provides support to a wide variety of digital newspaper editions from different regions of Spain. Specifically, six digital newspapers with a high number of requests were analyzed during a period of one year. The level of redundancy has been measured by a global (gR) and a partial redundancy (pR) method, which is new in this type of services. As a result, the main contribution of our paper is a global and partial redundancy model for each digital newspaper, which would allow us to forecast the level of video requests likely to be repeated in the near future. The model turned out to be user independent and with a timeless effect. The validation process shows that all the models successfully pass the hypothesis test, which means that there were no significant differences between the model and the real data. The pR models could predict between 1% and 6% of video requests temporal redundancy with a level of accuracy which varies between 88% and 100%. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we focused on perceived information overload by analyzing the number of tweets received, number of friends, and density of a user's egocentric network. These three variables were examined using objective data collected through Twitter's open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). We collected data concerning tweet overload through a web-based survey, and we used an ordered logistic regression analysis to examine the combined data (n = 1277). Results demonstrated that only the number of friends had a significantly positive effect on perceived tweet overload, while the number of tweets received did not produce a significant effect. Although the density of a user's egocentric network did not demonstrate any significant effect on perceived tweet overload, a significant interaction effect appeared between the number of friends and the density of this network. In other words, findings indicated that a large number of friends strengthened the network density's effect; by contrast, a smaller number of friends strengthened network density but reduced perceived tweet overload.

It examines the uses of the Internet, social networking sites and mobile text-messaging by the radio station. Three central questions constitute the major concerns of the article: (a) To what extent do institutional and organizational contexts shape the uptake and uses of the Internet and mobile phones by radio journalists? (b) How do the uses of the Internet and mobile phones in turn influence the institutional cultures and organizational practices? (c) To what extent, if at all, does radio convergence reconfigure traditional radio to create new spaces that augment audience participation? The article argues that any meaningful critique of the technological affordances to the radio institution must critically engage with the complex questions of the dialectical relationship between technology, structure, and agency especially given the seductive myth of the so- called new media. It concludes that digital media technologies on radio are subject to organisational, institutional, and social shaping, and that questions about the emancipatory power of these technologies especially to audiences and citizens are often exaggerated because the question of power relations between actors or interests is often overlooked. The digital turn and the demotic turn on radio therefore must not be seen as synonymous with the participatory turn, especially in African countries where the regulation of corporate power in mass media is weak and where multiple forms of the digital divide that impede on consistent and meaningful use of digital media still persist. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The results reveal that both attitude and perceived usefulness demonstrate a good prediction power of behavioural intention. Although perceived ease of use was found not to be a predictor of attitude, the results affirm its influence on perceived usefulness. The results also demonstrate the role of trust as the most influential determinant of individual perception of the usefulness of the services. Further, the results indicate that only the collection of personal location information, as a perceived privacy concern, had a significant negative impact on trust. Implications and future research are also discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Apple's launch of the iOS platform and associated App Store marketplace turned the market around, and Apple became the leading company in the business. This development caused existing players, such as Nokia, to renew their business and attracted new players, such as Google and Microsoft, to enter the market and introduce their own mobile platforms. To understand this development, we suggest that a generic abstracted model of the ecosystem around mobile platforms should be developed describing how the actors, including users, individual app developers, companies, and digital services, are connected and interact. In this work, we propose that competition and collaboration in this kind of abstracted ecosystem can be modeled and analyzed using network analysis. In our research, we derived weighted competition and collaboration networks for each mobile platform from an expert survey, and by calculating companies' degree centrality in their networks at different times we were able to illustrate how companies' strategies to build and maintain an ecosystem differ and develop over time. We believe that this kind of analysis is useful both for companies that build ecosystems and also for companies that plan to do business in them. The former can use it to compare their strategy with existing competitors and also evaluate emerging new ecosystems and the latter to compare and choose between possible ecosystems with which to do business. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Homophily refers to the phenomenon that people are more likely to make relational ties with others who are similar to themselves than those who are not, whereas social influence refers to the phenomenon that an individual's behavior is likely to become more similar to that of her friends over time. It is important to study both homophily and social influence processes of a social network because each process can lead to different structural characteristics for a social network; homophily can lead to separation among the members of a network, whereas social influence can lead to network-wide uniformity. In this study, we examine homophily and social influence processes among online casual game players. Specifically, we ask whether an online casual game player tends to be friends with other online casual game players who have similar game genre preferences and whether a player's genre preferences and gaming frequencies become more similar to those of her Kongregate friends over time. For this study, demographic attributes, game genre preferences, gaming frequencies, and relational ties for 2488 game players were collected for two time periods from Kongregate. The panel data were analyzed with RSiena, the R version of SIENA (Simulation Investigation for Empirical Network Analysis), a social network analysis program used for social network panel data. The results suggest that there might not be strong homophily and social influence processes operating among the game players in the sampled network. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The discussion is based on findings from a research study that investigated the impact of ICTs on community radio using regional case studies from three African countries-Mozambique, Uganda, and Mali. We argue that the integration of ICTs impacted journalism practice positively as it improved information gathering, processing, distribution, storage, and engagement with the communities, particularly through the use of mobile phones and the internet. However, the synergy with rural community radios that tend to be located in remote areas is yet to be felt in the three countries. While the community radio stations in semi-urban areas or those situated in areas with fairly good infrastructure have better capacity for integration of ICTs and their sustainability, the rural-based community radio stations are greatly inhibited in their integration of new ICT due to lack of the electricity or regular power supply, the high fees charged by the service providers (internet and telephone), as well as the high cost for the ICT equipment, maintenance expenses and operational costs. The article calls for more support for infrastructural development to rural-based community radio stations to close the rural-urban gap and to enable the journalists working there to benefit from ICT integration like their counterparts in the semi-urban and urban community radios. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The results of the data analysis suggest that mobile OS competition, mobile network standard competition, open source OS share (platform openness), and price influence the early diffusion of smartphones in OECD countries. However, in BRICS countries, open source OS share (platform openness) and price are the main factors of smartphone diffusion. As the smartphone market continues to grow, it seems that the effects of mobile platform competition and indirect network effects on smartphone diffusion may co-exist in global smartphone markets. In addition, the results of the data analysis suggest that a platform (standard)-neutral policy is important in the growth stage of smartphone markets. Also, analyses of influential factors on smartphone price reveal that the size of the installed base of subscribers and market entry of Android phones in global smartphone markets contribute to decreases in smartphone price in OECD and BRICS countries.

This potential is celebrated even more in contexts in which there is deemed to be a lack of political accountability or limited consultation of citizens by government. This article investigates the extent to which new technologies have changed the quality of audience participation in radio content production in Zambia. Engaging with literature on participation in media studies as well as development studies and based on interviews with station managers, producers and presenters of six radio stations in Zambia, the article examines both the opportunities and limits of the use of internet and mobile phones in audience participation. It argues that there is a need to situate these practices within a broader corporate logic in which participation is not merely about adding more voices but also feeds into radio stations' commercial strategies of increasing revenue and accessing personal data of listeners through SMS and social media. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In light of these differing outcomes, this paper identifies and compares the strategies behind the quest for national DTV standards by retracing the key policy initiatives in China and the US. Our analysis suggests that protectionist impulses shaping distinct standards for the US (Grand Alliance), China, and other regions dampen prospects for a global standard in DTV.

Prior literature reveals that subscribers often overpay for their service because of inappropriate rate plan selection. Having subscribers on financially-optimal rate plans is found to be beneficial from both churn reduction and tenure maximization perspectives. However, the revenue implications of deploying such a customer relationship management strategy have not been thoroughly researched. This paper examines the revenue implications by analysing 1249 post-paid mobile subscribers in Canada over a 44-month period. This research also provides insights into some potential moderators that may influence the strengths of the linkage between rate plan suitability and revenue contribution.© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

First, it attempts to answer the basic but crucial questions: Whether, on the whole, China's CSOs use Web2.0 style technologies, and how widely different Web2.0 style technologies have been adopted among China's CSOs. Second, it attempts to answer whether there is a regional difference (East China/Central China/West China) in the adoption of Web2.0 technologies; whether there is a difference in Web2.0 technologies adoption by financial resource (of CSOs); if yes, which group of CSOs are disadvantaged. This research found that most of the chosen Web2.0 style technologies have been widely adopted by CSOs. The use of Web2.0 style technologies and social media is likely to become a widespread phenomenon among CSOs in China. We found CSOs with medium financial support are more likely to use Web2.0, whereas CSOs with high financial support are left behind in the use of some Web2.0 technologies. More importantly, we found there is a regional inequality in the adoption of Web2.0 style technologies. CSOs in western China are left behind in the adoption of Web2.0. And CSOs in eastern China are more likely to use blog and Forum/BBS; CSOs in central China are more likely to upload video materials. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, it also tries to examine how these market-oriented policies have been implemented with Chinese characteristics and how they have influenced the operation of Chinese broadcasting market. In this article, it argues that television reform with Chinese characteristics is very likely to provide favorable conditions for the co-existence or co-operation of politics and market. In particular, it suggests that the effectiveness of Chinese state's control power has not been weakened but strengthened with its adoption of market-oriented reform in post-WTO period. Under such circumstances, the future of Chinese television is less likely to evolve into a free competition mechanism, but more likely into a pattern in which the state-owned media capitals achieve rapid growth and dominance through the process of market-oriented reform, and private and foreign ones have to choose for collaboration or even dependence upon the former. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in a time when strict measures to reduce energy consumption in all the industrial and services sectors are required, the ICT sector faces an increase in services and bandwidth demand. The deployment of Next Generation Networks (NGN) will be the answer to this new demand and specifically, the Next Generation Access Networks (NGANs) will provide higher bandwidth access to users. Several policy and cost analysis are being carried out to understand the risks and opportunities of new deployments, though the question of which is the role of energy consumption in NGANs seems off the table. Thus, this paper proposes a model to analyze the energy consumption of the main fiber-based NGAN architectures, i.e. Fiber To The House (FTTH) in both Passive Optical Network (PON) and Point-to-Point (PtP) variations, and FTTx/VDSL. The aim of this analysis is to provide deeper insight on the impact of new deployments on the energy consumption of the ICT sector and the effects of energy consumption on the life-cycle cost of NGANs. The paper presents also an energy consumption comparison of the presented architectures, particularized in the specific geographic and demographic distribution of users of Spain, but easily extendable to other countries. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Communication imperatives for indigenous peoples' representation in policy making: Lessons from the IPRA (Indigenous Peoples Rights Act) experience","2012","Telematics and Informatics","10.1016/j.tele.2011.10.004","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857784158&doi=10.1016%2fj.tele.2011.10.004&partnerID=40&md5=6d4060d08871fe1f1dab7b001880b987","The role of communication in social development requires a keener eye to explore the fragile position of this marginalized sector: the indigenous peoples or IPs. With information and communication scholars taking an interest in new challenges towards sustainable social change, it is important to lay down a frame of understanding of the fragility of indigenous peoples' position and the complexity of solutions being offered them. The purpose of the paper is to direct attention towards a sector whose voice, position and representations are vulnerable to political machinations surrounding decision- and policy-making. Indigenous peoples for years have become easy targets of economic and political players whose interventions in IP communities carry the name of development. In this era where the promises of globalization are entering the tiniest corners of societies and where the world is becoming a ""smaller place"", IPs are ironically being pushed towards the center and admonished to leave the periphery to become mainstream members of the bigger nation-state. Local-global coalitions could be a result of these unnatural movements. Mining and military exercises, to name a few, gain entry in IP territories to carry out development and diplomatic aid and in turn transform IP communities into compulsory beneficiaries of such interventions. This paper's exploration, however, is specifically focused on an arena where IP voice and representation are given legal remedies: the legislature. Although literature about the plight of indigenous peoples abound, focus on the catalytic role of IPs in policymaking is seldom documented and given attention to. This paper takes the reader to a Philippine situation where IPs were able to actively take part in the co-construction of their own reality, via their participation in the formulation of the Indigenous Peoples Right Act (IPRA). The role of communication in policymaking forms the rationale behind the paper's position. Policymaking opens an avenue for subjects to have their constructs on development emerge. That is the role of communication: a meaning-making activity where understanding is at its core. Although enactment of the IPRA happened more than a decade ago - and the law has had its share of brutal and unabashed criticism - recalling the story behind its formulation was necessary to derive insights on the following: Fragile groups as indigenous peoples were subjected to a linguistic battle in the policymaking arena.Consensus-building and social negotiations were communication approaches that contributed to IP representation in policymaking.IP-led advocacy shows that IPs as leaders and advocates can competently involve themselves in the affairs of government.There are imperatives of communication and information that can help facilitate the engagement of indigenous peoples in solving social problems, via the legislative arena. Information and insights concerning IPs' position and representation, the role contributed by communication, and distinctive qualities of IP-led advocacy are derived from the IPRA story. The routes by which the development project operates in the policymaking arena, as illustrated in the case of the IPRA, are then able to offer insights to the tasks we continue to face as information and communication scholars and practitioners. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This article provides a simulation of a digital dividend auction in a major-type European country. In one of the scenarios, the spectrum is not pre-allocated to any service in particular (service neutrality) while in the remaining four, blocks of spectrum are pre-allocated to DTT, mobile multimedia and mobile broadband communications. The results of the simulations reveal that the service neutrality scenario maximizes revenues for the seller and that, in general, DTT operators would seem to have fewer opportunities as the spectrum packaging is less protective for them.© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Facebook users invite surveillance, and personal information revealed by Facebook users is compiled into aggregated databases of linked information, preferences, and behaviors. In the interest of the ideals of individual empowerment, cultural integrity, social responsibility and equality, social networking communities are forming to interrogate networked surveillance. This article examines those communities of resistance in the form of ""sousveillance"" tactics that have emerged as a backlash to the surveilled environment. Sousveillance is ""watching from below,"" a form of inverse surveillance in which people monitor the surveillors. Examples include citizen video, watchdog web sites, or the monitoring of authorities (corporations, military, government). Sousveillance embraces the idea of transparency as an antidote to concentrated power in the hands of surveillors. Sousveillance is used in Facebook itself to expose the data gathered by Facebook to the larger networked population. The surveillance sector's responses to citizen resistance may ultimately alter the power dynamic between the watchers and the watched. Implications for this power dynamic are discussed through an exploration of Facebook sousveillance communities of resistance and how they are sustained in an effort to contribute to the larger examination of hegemonic practices in the global information society. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigates the pattern of Internet access amongst university students in South Africa. University students are a relevant population group for studying technology penetration; this population is a generation born in the current era of digital revolution, they are presumably early adopters of technology and are adept in using them. A survey conducted in ten South African universities reveals that beyond publicly available access on campuses - with its attendant constraints, personal/household Internet access is a challenge and it reflects a pattern of inequalities in South Africa. Bearing in mind that social and economic exclusion is the biggest challenge for South Africa, this study reveals that digital inequalities amongst students replicate the pattern of social inequalities in the country. This exacerbates existing social inequalities, specifically amongst university students in South Africa, with certain categories of students being disproportionately disadvantaged. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Hence, online communities play a less limited role in investment informational social support. Furthermore, investors with low social capital are often characterized by more intense reliance within narrow subgroups for investment information. Investors, especially those with high-investment risk profile, are truly hybrid information consumers.

In this platform, marginalized groups such as indigenous communities from the developing world can articulate claims, strategically mobilize and participate in the forms of meaning-making that constitute them. However, there is skepticism on the actual value of online spaces in effecting agency in an internet-mediated environment. Using James Scott's notion of 'hidden transcripts' and Andrew Feenberg's 'democratic rationalization of technology', the paper explores strategic approaches and historical, social, and political conditions embedded in the construction, negotiation, and transformation of indigenous online activist media. In-depth interviews and textual analysis of online spaces were conducted to understand the experiences and online articulations of two indigenous groups based in the Philippines, Tebtebba and Cordillera People's Alliance with specific attention to the: (a) forms and characteristics of online struggles, (b) dynamics and strategies behind the production and distribution of online dissent, (c) process of negotiation of technological use, and (d) perceived implications of online mediations on group identity, culture and struggle. Problematizing the complex interaction of technology and indigenous identity, the paper finds that indigenous activists' online media engagement constitutes a sustained balancing act between accommodation and resistance and online spaces are used creatively with reflection on the dangers and benefits of online spaces to the organization and the struggle.© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

While, however, many studies based on theoretical reduction potentials have been presented, in practice it has only been possible to cite a few examples of such reductions thus far. This article presents the results of a field experiment for one particular domain in which ICT can be substituted for more carbon-intensive technologies: using advanced videoconferencing technology to reduce intercontinental conference travel and thus travel-related GHG emissions. We organized a large resource management conference simultaneously on two continents and assessed the emissions caused by the attendees' travel and by the additional ICT equipment utilized to connect the two venues. We further assessed, based on a survey, the emissions in the alternative scenarios of holding the conference at either one of the places, and the satisfaction of the participants with the two-site conference format. The results show that reductions of 37% and 50% in travel-related GHG emissions were attained as compared to the single-site alternatives, although more people took part than in any of these alternatives. At the same time, the attendees' experience was clearly positive, showing that the multiple-site format can serve as an acceptable alternative to the traditional one-site format of holding an international conference. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In doing so we identify drivers, threats, and opportunities for new services based on audiovisual archives in the cultural heritage domain. By analyzing the market we provide insights into the preconditions for provision of fruitful and viable services that can be build upon these archives. Design/methodology/approach: The research method takes the form of a case study, including literature search and interviews. For this research we adopt the STOF-framework for analyzing purposes. This framework consists of four components: a service component, a technological component, an organizational component, and a financial component (STOF). Findings: The authors argue an imbalance between the different factors of the STOF-model in the Netherlands. First, the service domain in the Dutch audiovisual archive domain shows little knowledge about (potential) users and their needs regarding the archive. The service domain is therefore probably the biggest question mark in this market. Second, the technical component presents few impedances and is therefore least of an issue. Third, the organization component in terms of value network presents issues revolving around the nature of the cultural institution. Non-profit cultural organizations like Sound & Vision in the Netherlands are not naturally inclined towards business modeling around development of services. Fourth and last, the financial domain shows severe bottlenecks for unlocking the content regarding intellectual property. The clearing of copyrights is one of the main tasks of Images for the Future, but engulfs much time in the primary process. In sum, the study shows promising and problematic issues that arise in the field of developing audiovisual archive services. Research limitations/implications: This is a one-case study, so no cross analysis with other cases was possible. Future work includes the investigation of user needs regarding audiovisual cultural heritage and possible services upon the archives. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies that look into the factors in a particular domain that influence the viability of services by using a business model framework. This paper, therefore, extends the utilization of this framework (STOF-model) as it used as a method for the evaluation of a market and provides market insights. Also, the application on the audiovisual cultural heritage domain is quite novel. For practitioners regarding the development of audiovisual archive services the paper presents fresh insights in the configuration of the different business components of the services. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the theory of the niche and the uses and gratifications theory, this study investigates the displacement effect of the Internet on consumer time spent on traditional media. Data were collected in a mail survey with 688 respondents in Northwest Ohio and college students in a Northwest Ohio state university from October to December, 2009. The results indicate that the Internet indeed has a displacement effect on traditional media in the daily news domain and the effect takes place most prominently after 5 years of experience. Consumers' time spent on traditional media decreases as the years of Internet experience increases with diminishing returns. Among experienced Internet users, there was an increasing overlap between the Internet and traditional media, and they perceived the Internet as superior to traditional media. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Enterprise architecture (EA) by breaking down the organization's systems to its components and determining the relationship between them in different layers offers an appropriate solution for understanding and investigating relationships and processes of organizations which develop strategies and information technology plans. This paper proposes a conceptual model for enterprise IT architecture. For this purpose, conceptual and reference models of enterprise architecture are investigated and key concepts of them are described. By identifying dimensions of reviewed models, key dimensions of the proposed model are extracted and by using Shannon's entropy, weight and priority of each dimension is determined. In order to determine building blocks of each dimension, a mapping has been established between customer and functional requirements by using axiomatic method and relations between customer and functional requirements has been validated by experts' opinions using Quality Function Development (QFD) method. Proposed model has been described by determining goals, components and relations. Then the model is validated by surveying experts. Finally an Iranian telecommunication enterprise is selected for a case study and the model is tested there and promoting solutions are proposed to improve the status of the organization for implementing the model. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In Iran, the Internet provided a voice to repressed and marginalized groups, particularly young people and educated women. In 2003 the number of female Internet users in Iran reached a remarkably high proportion of nearly half (49%) of the total Internet users in the country, according to the International Telecommunication Union report (ITU, 2008). This constitutes a total of 11.5 million female Internet users in Iran which is the highest level of Internet penetration rate among Islamic countries in the Middle East. Since the first Farsi blog appeared online in 2001, thousands of weblogs have been created including blogs related to women's issues in Iran. Blogging in Iran has helped repressed and marginalized groups reach out, including women's and human rights activists, ethnic and religious minorities and Iranian youth to get their voices heard and to challenge the long standing univocal government and Islamic religious authorities. Women bloggers have been among the leading bloggers within the Iranian blogosphere. By applying the theory of social action and mobilization, this study finds that women's digital activities prove to be an effective means of participating in communication discourse and mobilizing the female population of Iran in their struggle for a just and fair society.© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Although previous research covers energy issues quite extensively, the treatment of the energy impacts of ICT integration in everyday life is still inadequate. The purpose of this paper is to complement the existing research by applying a perspective from which everyday life takes centre stage. A theoretical framework for describing and analysing the energy impacts of everyday life is outlined, based on a combination of practice theory and time geography. The framework is applied to a discussion of how ICT co-develops with changing everyday practices and energy-demanding features of everyday life. Based on empirical findings, it is explored how the use of ICT affects practices in relation to time and space, and it is argued that the changes may increase energy consumption considerably. The findings do not suggest that the integration of ICT in everyday practices inherently results in a more energy-intensive everyday life. ICTs have a great potential for reducing energy consumption, but the realisation of this depends on the wider economic and political conditions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/method/approach: In this research the mobile services are object of study and therefore an exploratory approach making use of Q-sort methodology is used. Findings: The characteristics of the 48 services under study play an important role when judged on the five dimensions. Advanced services, explicitly exploiting the mobile nature of the services like navigation and localization, embedded in all kind of task and process related activities, stood out as the most innovative services, however these are the least likely to be used because they are expected to fit day-to-day routines and usage context the least. Easy to use services and services that fit most contexts are most likely to be used. Practical implications: Designers of mobile services and applications have to be aware of the subtle interplay between usage context, the service or application to be designed, the ease of use. Only when all these factors are taken into account the services may have value to users. Original value: This is one of the very few studies focused on mobile services, instead of user perception and behavior. In most research on mobile service adoption and acceptance the characteristics of services are threatened as a black box. This paper shows how relevant it is to look into characteristics of mobile services themselves.© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The value generated from these costly 'digital city' investments is actually the value provided to the citizens and businesses by the e-services that will be developed and run on these network infrastructures. This paper proposes and validates a structured methodology for assessing and improving e-services developed in digital cities. The proposed methodology assesses the various types of value generated by an e-service, and also the relations among them, allowing a more structured evaluation, a deeper understanding of the value generation process and also identification and prioritization of the improvements that should be made in the e-service with the usually scarce resources in municipalities. This methodology is applied for the evaluation of an e-learning service developed in the Greek city of Karlovassi for young citizens, and also for the prioritization of the necessary improvements in it.

This growth can be observed even in developing countries like Thailand. To cope with this trend, this study attempts to provide guidance to a national regulatory agency (NRA) by addressing the following question: What are the key determinant factors for individual consumer to access mobile Internet? A discrete choice model is employed to examine empirically whether price, service, and application attributes, socio-economic variables, and service provider have a systematic link with the decision of the consumer. The data from a national survey in 2010 commissioned by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) of Thailand are used for the analysis. The results show that price, availability of fixed telephony, age, and living area are recognized as the strongest determinants for mobile Internet adoption. The findings also suggest that mobile Internet could be an alternative technology to bridge the digital divide, as the group of people that does not have fixed Internet connection at home can connect via mobile Internet. The price of mobile Internet service is inelastic, however, which means that an increase in price does not affect the propensity to access mobile Internet. This is a result of the lack of competition in fixed connection due to the concession, and it leads to limited choice for the consumer. Telecom regulators and policymakers therefore need to consider policies such as increasing competition and infrastructure investment in order to stimulate growth of mobile Internet adoption and close the digital divide in Thailand. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Interpersonal communication is believed to mediate campaign effects through the creation of social learning environments. Therefore, many HIV and AIDS strategies (e.g. entertainment education programmes) use mass media channels for conveying messages on the one hand and spurring interpersonal communication among target groups on the other hand. However, it seems hard to find solid evidence that mass media campaigns are able to stimulate interpersonal communication. Simultaneously, there is a rising interest in the use of new technologies for HIV and AIDS prevention. As a result of their unique characteristics, such as interactivity and anonymity, they could be more appropriate than traditional channels to stimulate interpersonal communication. To gain insights in the challenges and opportunities of new technologies for primary HIV/AIDS prevention, this article presents the findings of a case study carried out at the University of the Western Cape. This study aimed at developing, implementing and evaluating an anonymous online discussion platform for students to share experiences and discuss sensitive subjects. The discussion forum was used in three ways: compulsory (through curriculum integration), semi-voluntarily and voluntarily. An extensive evaluation provided strong evidence that the online discussion forum was only successful when formally integrated into the curriculum. The most important opportunity of the formally integrated online forum relates to the creation of a social learning environment. The anonymous character of the online platform allayed fear for stigma and discrimination and removed cultural barriers concerning the inappropriateness of discussing HIV/AIDS related issues. As a result, the platform created a space in which students discussed freely, considered old and new ideas, acquired knowledge, and learned to esteem varying views on the subjects of discussion. Although no assertions can be made on the effects of these outcomes on sustainable changes in attitudes or behaviour, these findings indicate that participating in an anonymous online platform can instigate students to reflect on HIV/AIDS in a different way. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It allows employers to observe what employees do on the job and review employee communications, including e-mail and internet activity that employees consider private. Often, employers use electronic monitoring to ensure organizational confidentiality, limiting employer liability for employee misconduct. From the perspective of employees, electronic monitoring by employers involves several privacy and confidentiality concerns. Most of the time, employee performance and productivity aspects captured via electronic monitoring are effectively used by the Human Resources Departments, for decision making associated with the employees. Majority of the software development organizations in Sri Lanka today use some means of electronic technology to monitor their employee activities. Most of the time, employee perception towards electronic monitoring at work, contradicts with the need for law enforcement within the organization intended by the top management. Employers justify electronic monitoring at work place in terms of protecting the company's confidential information, preventing the misuse of the organizational resources while uplifting the quality of work and productivity. On the other hand, the mutual trust that should be there between the employer and the employee is in question. Therefore, this study empirically investigated the relationship that might exist between the software professionals' perception towards electronic monitoring at work place and its impact on their job satisfaction. Based on disproportionate stratified random sampling, data were collected from 380 software professionals in Sri Lanka, by administrating a structured questionnaire in which items were of 5 point Lickert scale. The data analysis included the univariate, bivariate and multivariate analyses. In this study, Perceived Relevance to Work and Personal Judgment of Effectiveness which were two variables used to measure perception of electronic monitoring were positively correlated with Job Satisfaction. This means that the software professionals, who view electronic monitoring as something which is relevant to their work as well as which uplifts the quality of their work, are satisfied in their jobs. Perceived Invasion of Privacy was negatively correlated to Job Satisfaction, which sheds some light in organizational electronic monitoring policy making. Also, Perceived Task Satisfaction was negatively correlated to Job Satisfaction. This means that the software professionals, who thought that working in an electronically monitored environment makes their tasks more complex, are rather dissatisfied in the job. Also, it appeared that the impact of electronic monitoring at work place on the job satisfaction of software professionals becomes less significant along with higher professional experience. The findings of this research can be incorporated in IT security policy making in the software development organizations in Sri Lanka and in similar economics, with a special emphasis on the job satisfaction of their employees, which is the most valuable asset of the organization. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicate that the space-biased feature of television is enhanced by a combination of space-biased technologies and ritualized contents (i.e.; drama and popular entertainment). Meanwhile, the over-emphasized space-biased feature is counterbalanced by a combination of time-biased technologies and instrumental contents (i.e.; knowledge/information programs). Of more importance, the study supports three development trajectories of modern communities and media: (1) the larger scale the community has, the more the community relies on media to organize and coordinate; (2) the larger scale the community has, the less the community is tied to the traditional sources; and (3) the larger scale the community has, the less the community has shared cultural practices. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Political blog readers: Predictors of motivations for accessing political blogs","2012","Telematics and Informatics","10.1016/j.tele.2011.04.003","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80052807514&doi=10.1016%2fj.tele.2011.04.003&partnerID=40&md5=ce4039877899cefb243a6c2ddb12c161","This study examines the motivations for why politically interested Internet users in the United States access political blogs and attempts to discover which factors predict motivations for using political blogs. Political surveillance/guidance motives appeared as the strongest motivation for using political blogs, followed by expression/affiliation, convenience/information seeking, and entertainment. Hierarchical regression analysis reveals that blog users with higher levels of political involvement and strength of party affiliation are attracted to political blogs to freely express their political opinion and communicate with other like-minded people, which may indicate the potential of Weblogs as an interactive political discursive space. Based on the findings, this study presents implications and suggestions for future research.© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"IT support services for telecommuting workforce","2012","Telematics and Informatics","10.1016/j.tele.2011.10.002","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857783116&doi=10.1016%2fj.tele.2011.10.002&partnerID=40&md5=95e26918b4000ab71af2ab3b9cf02b69","Organizations are in the process of moving to a network-based operating structure. Telecommuting is just a corollary of this push. While new information technologies allow for a highly mobile work force that can work from remote locations across the world, this begs the question how does supporting this new telecommuting workforce differ from supporting employees in a regular office. The purpose of this study is to describe how telecommuting and a telecommuter differ from in situ working and the desk-bound worker and how this difference dictates different approaches to providing various services such as IT support services for telecommuters. Our goal is to provide a framework to assist IT managers in addressing issues of how to support telecommuting employees to maximize their potential benefits. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"Energy efficiency of mobile handsets: Measuring user attitudes and behavior","2012","Telematics and Informatics","10.1016/j.tele.2012.01.005","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863982341&doi=10.1016%2fj.tele.2012.01.005&partnerID=40&md5=5adb5832c12b26ad32141d3cee256c97","The purpose of this research is to understand the behavior and expectations of mobile handset users towards energy consumption. We analyze mobile handset monitoring traces from subsequent years with N = 253 and 105, and questionnaire studies with N = 155 and 150. The data allows us to study both the actual behavior of the users and their explicit attitudes, expectations, and experiences. Additional difference to prior work is the use of longitudinal data from multiple years and a user sample that is much larger than in earlier studies. We present hypotheses drawn both from literature and from our own experience, and use the datasets to support or refute them. Our results indicate that mobile device users need more detailed and clearer information of the battery status and energy consumption. Moreover, users want to understand how different applications and services affect the energy consumption and to learn what they can do to control it. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper investigates how the Chinese state censors the Internet by tracing the trajectory of mechanisms to block websites non grata. Results show that Chinese government's Internet control methods are diverse with systematic collaborations from local authorities at various administrative levels. We also found evidence that the government has customized blocking strategies for what it considers to be important websites. The efficacy and implications of China's Internet censorship system were also discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Censorship; China; Control; Internet"

While there are many ways of dispersing information on environmental hazards, people may not be very responsive. In this study, we hypothesize that the obstacles to effective information dispersion can be attributed to factors such as limited memory retention, projection bias, and urgency of the problem, which are major concepts of behavioral economics. An empirical survey supports this hypothesis and emphasizes the need to overcome these obstacles in order to improve the efficiency of dispersing information on the environment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

As these networks are being transformed into next-generation networks, new and different services are being developed and mediated. However, little is known about the drivers of this development, and frameworks for strategic management of service innovation are scarce. This paper offers two contributions. First, it develops a conceptual framework for the identification and classification of drivers. This framework is derived from prevailing theories in organizational economics, strategic management, and marketing. Second, it presents, based on an analysis of contributions from 24 domain experts, which types of drivers for network service development receive the most attention by the experts. The analysis reveals that demand factors like customer values, service quality, and user readiness by far outnumber the supply factors as well as the general environmental factors, demonstrating the importance of the users for service development in this area. The results will assist service providers to identify drivers of a specific service offering and adjust the business model to these drivers. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
